1704643706.0,"The reality is you only get 20% of your life, most less, where you won’t be in some sort pain","When I turned 30, a stark reality laid before me. I lost half my eye sight to a rare eye disease, couldn’t drink all night and feel okay anymore, felt tired more often then energized. 

Then after, after each year passed in my 30s, I realized the amount of pain I was feeling from my body was increasing consistently. The amount of inbuprofen, advil I consumed monthly went up vastly. I did my doctor visits, all my bloodwork came back exceptional. What was happening?

Gravity. Mortality. My body was being pummeled by it. I was simply. Normal. 

And then it dawned on me. My best years were long gone. Sure, I could fight and get some energy back. That doesn’t change my revelation:

Lots of people die in their 80s or before. Most people only get 15 to 20% of life with no pain. After that the diseases set in, the malnutrition, the disabilities.

I’m currently working on a story about the attitudes & behaviors of nihilists, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in participating?

You just have to answer these 3 questions:

1.) How did you come to identify as a nihilist or with the belief of nihilism? Please share your personal experiences & reasoning.

2.) How has nihilism affected your current habits & lifestyle? Did they change before you encountered nihilism?

3.) What would make you change your mind about nihilism? And why?

If you feel like participating you can either: 

(1) reply to my post here. I might reply as well just for you to clarify or elaborate on your answers.

Or (2) you can email me at psychedelicnihilist609@gmail.com to schedule a videocall interview if you feel up to it. But I will be asking additional questions about your background (not too much in-depth stuff, just stuff like your nationality & gender etc.) and you will need to sign & fill out a Consent Form.

Either way, JUST NOTE if you do choose to participate I will be using & collecting your answers for the story.

From a Eastern spirituality view, there is no point in a Truth in the form of a fact. Knowing a Fact that poor suffer and rich happy would not give you money. Knowing that life is hard would not give you happiness no matter how true it is.

Is it worth searching for The Truth ""No ultimate Truth"" in a meaningless world instead of having positive mindset and practicing Meditation and discipline?

Till now even science failed to do anything significant. All it did is to make life comfortable !>!For rich people only!<! But doesn't grant satisfaction or happiness on it's own because satisfaction must come from within.

I am trying to stay with positive mind simply because I see no point in being negative as I don't care about Reality as there is no right or wrong.

Just Go with the Flow cause there is no point in being a brave hard person that will be broken by the sheer pressure of the flow while the soft will survive going with the flow because soft surrendered itself to the Flow.

1704453810.0,Food for thought,"I was just finished watching the Lex Fridman podcast with Jeff Bezoz ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY)) and I rationalized some about my life situation.

I am just impressed how one of the smartest persons in the world is just trying to advance humanity and he recognizes that not even him will be able to land in the moon in his lifetime. That is just surprising to me, all this effort for nothing. If someone as smart as he is is doing something which results will not be seen that means something to me. I am absolutely confident that people are wired differently, to me ... to us, I would never ever ever do something that may be used in the future, I am so careless about what happens to this world after I am 70 y/o. Like why would anyone care

We (nihilists) are just so unprepared to live this life, we are supposed to want to be rich, to want a nice car, to want kids and want a big house but I (and I assume most of us) am so unmotivated to really achieve anything else. Like, I am already here, so what am I supposed to do? should I buy a new car and drive very fast, or should I have 10 kids to teach them how nice life is? Everything about this world disgust me. the one thing that I like (nature) was completely destroyed and replaced with humans that like big houses and big cars.

So, my conclusion. we are right but unfortunately we are wrong, we are right in that there is really no purpose, if we die discovering the cancer treatment or if we die not doing anything is the same end result. we die... the end... and that's it. but we are wrong because we really should want to achieve great things, we should want to make more and more money and have more and more kids, and we should want to advance human civilisation. We are the odd ones here unfortunately. But in the end, we all.... rich... poor... Mr, Bezos.... Putin. all are going to die and will make no difference to us (which is the only thing that should matter)",0

1704429400.0,An event of convergence,"Sometimes in my many wonders words come across and certain phrases form, one of those is ""inevitability is purpouse"": meaning that we can access the function of something by what It becomes when It ceases to be and becomes something Else.
Of course this statement may have many inquiries that are deserving of questioning, so;
1.What exactly does ""purpouse"" means in this context?
Purpouse means to give meaning by what function It provides to make something be, that line of thought is still abstract so let me give an example: be It the wood used to make a carving out of a chair, the cells that give the properties to the tissue they make, ALL of this is dependent on a perspective and a metaphisical question of ""How long does the present lasts?"" After all, If time is nothing but the perception of motion trough a given medium, that would make so that what defines How long a time is the Very moment where present becomes past, a point where there is no in between an past event and now, that would of course require reality to be finitally divisable and that by that Very moment inertia takes place but cannot be perceived until there is a perceivable change in the position of its components.
Yes, it is confusing and i think i am missing something, but don't know what quite yet, and also on How i should approach the notion of How things move?
But i mostly Said this because i needed to relate the notion of past present and Future to stabilish what is fullfiling a purpouse and what is creating out of It.
2. What do i mean by ""inevitability""?
Inevitability is what cannot be avoided, now, what i said in the previous statement is something that fits this description? 
 Technically yes If you are a determinist but i don't wanna go trough that line of thought, i think that there is more to inevitability then Just being what is unavoidable, mostly i think of It as point of wich is more difficult to comeback then It is to create It, i don't know If this is more of an example then a definition but i'll stick with It.
3. So, with this things in mind, what does It mean ""inevitability is purpouse""?
I believe It is"" the purpouse of something is defined when an action leading from an context creates something that is easier to create then It is to Destroy""

But with ALL of this out of the way, what does It amount to?
Well, i think that when this logic( that may be flawed) IS applied to existence, we come up with certain things, events that lead to the formation of the Sun, the point on wich water can exist in liquid form, the time where chemical reactions became able to act onto their existence to create copies of themselves, the endosimbiosis of the mithochondria and cloroplasts
The evolution of plants, the developing of multiple strategies of survival and the eventual emergence of a mind with meta-cognitive abilities, the creation of civilizations and so on, the degree of complexity and ability of matter to act on itself continues to grow and grow, and i Wonder If in this growth there is a set limit to It, or there Will come a time where the limit of How complex reality can be Will be set by the amount of matter that is available? That is? Can there be living planets that think? Can the cosmos be unified under the literally astronomical complexity of i highly speculative entity to Focus on achieve a sole goal?
Yes i am thinking that in the inevitability of this emergence there is space for the interpretation of It being its purpouse, that of existence. Tho i Will admit that It does sound kinda bolocks, and i am but a cafeneited fool, but so also i am no thinking planet, so what do i know?
Anyway, what is the most complex thing that can exist?",0

Then the shutdowns. Outdoor parks closed. The forced masks. The double masks. The triple masks. The death tickers on the news. People losing jobs. The arguing. All of it was insane. Complete madness. 

Then near the end of the pandemic…I was like “wow, life is ridiculously stupid and none of this shit matters…and the Covid freak out probably stemmed from people thinking that any of this DOES matter”. It was pretty eye opening…but quite depressing.

1704167543.0,nursing home nihilism,"OK working in a nursing one is one of the darkest things I've experienced in my little life. 

I want to be an OT so I can actually help people find some sort of function in activity because I guess that's the closest I can get to making some sort of healthcare career out of the philosophy: we do, we die. 

I'm half way through my degree now after my colleagues begged me to get the fuck out of nursing home work while I'm young. many of the women I work with have life-long chronic pain from lifting people who don't even want to be alive anymore.

but nursing care, holy shit. it made me realise how fucked we are as a society: forcing people to die long, uncomfortable deaths whilst taking all their money. and for what? 

I mean most of these people are slowly rotting away with nothing to do. maybe someone with a basket of kittens and guinea pigs will come in and put them on their laps, taking photos for a promotional Facebook post so even more people will come to join Hell's waiting room.

my job is to convince peoples nans that I'm ""here to help"" when I forcibly undress them and shove goopy, thickened porridge down their throats. I'm 21 but it's very normal to be called ""mummy"" by people in their 80s. they have no idea. 

it's the screaming and fear really. most are incapable of communicating or understanding. moments of lucidity come and go in the early stages but once the talking goes, you have no idea what it is like for them.

we are instructed to feed and encourage until they make it very clear they want no more. I've been accused of neglect for refusing to force feed an 100 year old who screamed in my face when I tried to inject goop through a syringe into her mouth.

there's legislation around this. ""best intrest decisions"". but when it comes to food, no company wants the stain of neglect and starvation on their reputation so we just feed and clean until they aspirate and get pneumonia or a uti from sitting in poo for hours at a time.

then finally, once their sats and obvs are degrading enough they get that sweet sweet diamophine.

oh, but just enough for the agonising pain of dying to ease off slightly. we wouldn't want them OD or something.

I remember a woman who was usually completely out of it, and actually quite sweet and funny in her confusion. then one afternoon I woke her from her nap to change her pad and clean her. she rolled over, completely institutionalised and looking utterly empty inside and let me do my job. then she looked back at me and said ""I don't know who you are but I'm begging you, kill me"". all I can say is ""well your son loves you very much, would you like to call him?"" and she said ""don't tell him, I can't do this anymore"". her speech was the clearest I'd heard from her, ever. I explained I couldn't do anything to help her and she told me to ""fuck off then"" and I had to leave her to go to the next poor sod.

legally, I don't know how assisted dying or euthanasia would be delivered to people with dementia and other forms of brain damage but we need to figure this shit out. I can't keep working the misery farm whilst the company harvests their money from slow deaths.

I think the worst was a woman with a rare cancer that was essentially eating her and rotting her flesh whilst she was alive. her genitalia to her naval was one big, necrotic, cancerous open wound. watching her wince in pain as she had a bed bath, yet being unable to have any agency in that experience made me feel like Satan himself. there was nothing dignified in any of that. the smell was awful and the pain caused her to thrash and kick in her sheets, often exposing her family members to the tumour and sores.

she was a beautiful, amazing person in life according to her family. a care free hippy in the 60s who regularly campaigned for women's rights. she deserved agency over her death. her family were upset she wasn't fit to fly out to dignitas like she wanted.

it's horrible to feel joy and peace when someone dies in your care. but I can't lie, I've never got upset or cried once. I breathe a sigh of relief that they no longer have to suffer. then less than 24 hours later, someone new moves in and the cycle continues.

I am not into philosophy at all. I'm a chronic overthinker with ADHD, depression and insomnia so idk any of the academia behind this nihilism stuff but i think i get the general jist. 

this thought cycle has plagued me for years and I wonder what you lot have to say on the subject. does anyone here work in health and social care? how should we approach death in institutions? does anyone have experience of feeling this overwhelming guilt of watching someone suffer unnecessarily?

But you are running out of time only if your mind is thinking that there are goals to achieve, more things to experience. Ok but what about the form? It disappears so it has a time limit. Well, let's take a bathtub filled with water and pour in a bag of ice cubes. The ice cubes are becoming smaller. Are they running out of time? Wouldn't it be right to say that it's only our mind that makes a distinction between ice cube and water? In fact they are the same and not separate from each other. So only if there is a concept (mind) of ice cube, time enters the game.

With other words, no mind, no time.

Like a mushroom coming to the surface. In fact the mushroom is only the fleshy fruit body of the much bigger fungal network in the soil. If the mushroom gets eaten or cut off it doesn't affect the fungal network underground. Similarly we could be seen like a fruit growing out of this world. We identify with this ""fruit"" and we say we are a separate being. Therefore many people are terrified by the thought of death and disappearing into nothingness forever. Because we are just this little mushroom on the surface, isolated, fragile and helpless against all the predators and dangers, standing there alone not knowing where we came from and where we're heading, not knowing that we are connected with the giant fungal network in the ground, that we in fact are this whole network. 
Another example is golden jewelry. There are all kinds of forms, rings, chains, crosses etc. made from gold. But in fact the nature of all these different items is not its form but the gold itself. The form of the gold is just in our minds, our minds give meaning to it. But it can be molten and remodeled into other shapes and it remains just gold.

The state we are in now, thinking of ourselves as separate beings that have a start and an end, would be fake and the state after and before it would be the reality. So if that was true, the question of what happens after death would be irrelevant as we were never this separate being in the first place. One could say we were never born and will never die.",0

1703877261.0,"Where does this leap in thought that ""meaninglessness"" must somehow lead to depression or even a lack of worth in living occur in Nihilism?","The best explanation I have is that, when we come from a teleological culture, our mind is baked in so many layers of meaning about existence, that when you accept the idea of meaninglessness, everything said about existence then is null, and perhaps there is a feeling of emptiness for those who are or use to be attached to ideas of what existence means. One might feel as if they are a point on an empty white page, especially if they are coming from a spiritual culture. Perhaps people feel adrift without a boat to sit in, so to speak, and opponents of Nihilism may take advantage of this and say, ""That feeling of openness or emptiness you feel? That is bad, bad stuff. You are probably depressed and you might even feel like dying if you don't climb back into our cruise-ship of meaning!"" I mean, what's the scariest way to tell a Nihilist they're wrong? ""You're going to die,"" 

If this feeling of open or emptiness is not ascribed a meaning such as ""bad"", ""depression"", ""ideation about death"", by the culture that we live in, then that feeling just is what it is. A blank slate does not necessarily have to be a bad thing (just as anything else when things are not intrinsically meaningful). So in conclusion, I chalk it up to cultural expectations about what meaningfulness is or how we feel when we accept an idea of meaninglessness. 

Growing up secular, the idea that meaninglessness must be associated with depression or death seems like a non sequitur to me; an irrational line of thought not having much to do with the idea of Nihilism in the first place. Even those who hold this position seem to agree with the opposition, this idea that accepting ""meaninglessness"" leads to a terrible quality of life for some reason? Explaining why opponents feel this way about Nihilism is easier than explaining why Nihilists themselves seem to feel this way.

However, I see this all the time in existentialist spaces; there are Nihilists who say something like this, ""Life is meaningless, therefore, life is worthless, therefore, death is preferable."" It seems like there is a false equivalence between ""meaning"" and ""worth"" which are semantically different. I then come to a brick wall when I try to explain to myself where this line of thought that ""meaninglessness = life is worthless."" Where is the in-between mental work that leads to this idea? How does this follow?  ",0

Camp 1: Is interested in Nihilism, embraces it and is perfectly happy with it. I’m NOT addressing this camp. 

Camp 2: Suffers from a lack of hope, feelings of meaninglessness and most likely depression. Im talking to you guys. 

In case you’re not aware of it yet: Most people searching for meaning are actually searching emotions. Not logical solutions to our existence. 
It is however possible both ways, if you are depressed everything feels meaningless, and if you start thinking that everything is meaningless you might become depressed and hopeless. 

The point I want to make here is, that you can NOT solve emotions with logic. No amount of thinking about it will make the emotions you feel go away. You will never find this magical solution to the questions of our existence, no one does. 

What’s the difference between you and Camp 1 ? They are not emotionally attached to this topic like you are. For them it’s just philosophy. 

So, what’s the solution ? Straight acceptance. Do not give any value to meaninglessness by resisting it. See yourself as the ultimate Rebell to meaninglessness. Everything can be meaningless and go to shit, but you my friend, you will prevail. Giving the concept of meaning to nothing else but yourself. Put your attention off those topics and focus all on your “real life” problems as best as you can. Ironically, by accepting meaninglessness and fixing your underlying emotional state, the meaning will return by itself without you expecting it. And take your time, I needed about 1 year for this development, but here I am giving absolutely no fuck about any meaning. I’m immune to this. Yet there is meaning to me everywhere again.

I just want to hide myself from it, completely. I do not want to be perceived. If I could press a magical button to unfuck everything, I would. 

There is no meaning, to anything. And yet, I must give my life a purpose. But, what purpose is there, given the things that I lack? Given the life that I have not lived? Really, there is no purpose beyond that which I give life, but the things which I would assume give life a “purpose” are absent. So here I am, now.

Fuck it all. Fuck this body that I have been cursed with. Fuck these thoughts I have been cursed with. Fuck these dice for rolling in the way they have. I hate it all.

These last little pieces of hope are leaving me. I am losing hope, for myself and everyone else. At least I won’t have to worry about it anymore, when my consciousness fades away. Which begs the question; what is the point of me continuing to live in this world? The vague hope that things will get better? Yet, I am too much of a coward to end my life. I am quite the coward indeed.

A biological machine?"")

Please seek professional support before reading this article if you are not feeling psychologically stable. I advise you not to put it off and not to try to overcome the problems on your own. Have a pleasant day.

  
This article is written by a non-professional and doesn't claim to have all the answers. It's my own effort to think deeply about what life means, written in an honest way. (An improved version of my previous attempt)

  
I believe that building a solid foundation for our lives can greatly aid in our personal development. Therefore, I am sharing this post to gather opinions and enhance my arguments, hoping to assist others in contemplating this topic.

  
The aim of this article is to propose methods for establishing a meaningful foundation in our lives within a deterministic universe (encompassing physicalism, random events, and quantum phenomena, as per the prevailing scientific viewpoint). This deterministic outlook can cause intellectual unease for some individuals due to a conflict between their evolutionary psychology and the actual nature of reality. While our psychology naturally searches for meaning, reality often presents itself as a mechanical system, providing limited room for the existence of free beings or inherent meaning.

  
**The Meaninglessness of Life and the Inner Conflict it Creates: An Attempt at Analysis**  
**1.** Physicalism is true to a high degree. (By scientific observations that all the events we encounter in our daily lives so far depend on the laws of physics. We can observe this for ourselves. In this case, whether or not a contrary example is given, it is observed that physicalism is largely true).  


**2.** In a physicalist universe, a free will is unthinkable, and even if it were, its influence would be highly restricted and again dependent on high-level physicalist rules. (That is, even if we assume that free will exists somewhere in there, it would be so highly influenced by the laws of physics that it would be very difficult to make a visible difference.)  


**3.** For this reason, it seems right that the concept we refer to as ""ourselves"" is only an illusion created by our brains. (That is, what we call ""me"" is actually a natural phenomenon that follows the laws of physics but makes us feel as if we have free will).  


**4.** The human being, who realizes this and has the intellectual capacity to fully comprehend it, is caught between the search for meaning, driven by the instinct for survival and self-preservation that his evolutionary psychology creates, and the conflict created by this newly realized illusion of self.  


**5.** Because as an acceptance of a physicalist world, everything will now become essentially groundless. The values he accepts are meaningless because they are not based on any foundation.  


**6.** Trying to counteract this situation, man decides that it is actually much better to create his own meaning and build his own values than to rely on a ready-made value system. This is actually a way out, which at first seems to be the right one.  


**7.** However, the realization that the values that one accepts are based on an illusion of self will always preserve the conflict within oneself that one can never get rid of.  


**8.** The persistence of this conflict may prevent people from approaching life as passionately as others who hold certain dogmas. In this case, as a result of natural selection, those who adhere to certain dogmas and those who can connect to the virtual meanings they have created will naturally always come to the fore.  


**9.** Although this may make one feel as if they are in a prison, like an actor watching them through their eyelids, it is just as absurd to feel depressed or bad because of this.  


**10.** The reason why this conflict makes people feel bad and drives many to depression is because of the sudden emptiness caused by the loss of their deep belief in the dogmas of the day and the pain of no longer having a passion that has the same basis as before.  


**10.1** When a person has to perform certain necessary tasks in order to survive, and has to work and suffer the necessary pains of survival, he will feel bad because he will not be able to find a sufficient fundamental reason for suffering.  


**10.2** For example, if a worker or a student who has to work 8 hours a day focuses on the inherent baselessness of this work, the thought that these compulsory tasks do not serve a direct purpose will cause him pain. This can lead to depression or mood disorders.  


**11.** There are some attitudes that can be taken in this situation:  


>**11.1** Possibility of being wrong:  
**11.1.1** The Fallacy of Physicalism: Even if there is a very high probability that physicalism is true, and even if there is only a very limited possibility of free will, there is a possibility that this analysis is wrong. And phenomena in physics and in life for which there are still no complete answers raise the possibility that our understanding may in fact be wrong.  
**11.1.2** The Philosophical Fallacy: The possibility that the argument is invalid because of technical errors in the content or the way the premises are connected in this thought process. This can also arise as a result of later developments, even if they do not exist now.  
>  
>  
**11.2** Conceptual Fallacy About Free Will: Even if we accept that we are a biological machine as a result of physicalism, the fact that we exist as a system and that we can evaluate external factors with our minds and respond accordingly, unlike many other beings, and that we can renew and improve ourselves with external (new information) and internal inputs (inner thoughts) may actually prevent us from seeing ourselves as a system as just an ordinary mechanical clock. Even if this is in essence just a step back from causality, it can make it easier for us to make sense of ourselves from a higher level. Moreover, just as the concept of consciousness is interpreted as ""emergent behavior"", it is also possible to interpret free will in a similar way.  
>  
>  
**11.3** The Curiosity of Our Existence: In a 13.8 billion year old universe, the fact that we are the only system in the universe that we know of that can think for itself, and that our extremely complex and ""conscious"" structure formed on a single dust cloud (Earth) at the end of billions of years of evolution, opens a path full of mystical questions that need to be answered at the same time. This situation can enable us to suppress this conflict within us by enabling us to place the baselessness of our life on the foundation of our life, that is, to adopt answering this question as a goal as a new foundation.  
>  
>  
**11.4** Asking the Right Question: Maybe we are not asking the right question about meaning and purpose. What I really mean by this is the possibility that our perspective and our logic is fundamentally wrong. In other words, our point of view in interpreting the universe and ourselves may not be something we can comprehend at the moment, but as our thinking system, intellectual capacity and level of experience increase, we may be able to reach answers that will eliminate our inner conflict with more accurate questions.  


**12.** Conclusion: Because of the pain of this inner conflict, a person may feel meaningless, helpless, lonely, unhappy, weak-willed and powerless. This is natural. Although it is one's ""own"" ""choice"" to allow this perspective to bring one down and make the situation worse, it would not be the right choice to continue to feel bad about oneself because of this situation which, as mentioned above, is not one hundred percent certain. Although grappling with these uncertainties can lead to difficult and sometimes meaningless feelings, it is actually one of the most logical ways to seek meaning in the face of these uncertainties, and within this new perspective, to be more aware of the importance of the cause-effect relationship and to make an effort to shape the self by organizing itself accordingly.  


**13.** In other words, if one accepts this uncertainty and uses it as a basis to give oneself a new purpose rather than using it as an excuse for laziness, one can hold on to life even more passionately than before, and take an active role in our journey to unravel the mystery behind our existence as humanity, and take a leading role in paving the way for truths that we cannot even guess at the moment.  
In this way, maybe one day we can ask the right questions and get the answers we seek.

1703423491.0,Life is Meaningless and Finding Meaning is Impossible: The Proof,"This article is intended for philosophical discussion only and does not suggest that one cannot enjoy life or should cease living; if you are experiencing psychological distress, please seek professional help before delving into these profound topics.

## The Proof:

1. **Foundation in Determinism and Physicalism:** As established, all phenomena, including human consciousness and decision-making, are governed by deterministic physical laws. This framework negates the existence of free will and independent agency.
2. **The Illusion of the Self:** The 'self' is an emergent property of complex neurological processes, not an independent entity. This understanding implies that the beliefs, desires, and motivations we attribute to our 'selves' are also products of deterministic processes.
3. **Absurdity of Self-Created Meaning:** Since the self is not an independent entity, and our thoughts and desires are products of deterministic processes, the concept of creating one's own meaning is inherently flawed. The idea of ""creating meaning"" presumes an agency and self that are illusory.
4. **Meaning as a Human Construct:** Any meaning that individuals believe they are creating is itself a result of deterministic processes. It is not an authentic expression of free will or personal agency, but rather a byproduct of the same deterministic laws governing all other phenomena.
5. **Circularity and Lack of Foundation:** The act of creating meaning is based on the premise of having a self capable of independent thought and decision-making. Since this premise is invalid (as per the deterministic and physicalist view), the act of creating meaning becomes a circular and baseless endeavor.
6. **Inherent Meaninglessness Remains Unresolved:** Consequently, attempting to create one's own meaning does not address the fundamental issue of life's inherent meaninglessness. It is merely a distraction or a coping mechanism, not a logical or effective solution to the existential dilemma.

**Conclusion:**

* **Futility of Creating Meaning:** In a deterministic and physicalist framework, where the self is an illusion and free will does not exist, the endeavor to create one's own meaning is both absurd and meaningless. It does not provide a genuine escape from the inherent meaninglessness of life, but rather represents an illogical and futile attempt to impose order on an indifferent universe.
* **The Paradox of Perceived Control:** While we are essentially prisoners in the deterministic game of life, our inability to perceive ourselves purely as biological machines compels us to live as if we possess independent agency. This paradoxical situation allows us to continue our lives under the illusion of control. However, the awareness that this control is indeed an illusion shatters the enchantment of our existence. This realization makes it challenging to overcome the sense of life's meaninglessness. In this context, there is no ultimate solution or definitive goal. Distinctions between choices like not to continue life, indulging in hedonism, adopting stoicism, or embracing any other worldview become inconsequential.

Ultimately, in a deterministic universe where free will is an illusion, nothing holds intrinsic significance or value. This perspective leads to the conclusion that all choices are equally meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

In the begining We were here. Between these walls and behind these bars. Each of us were inside in our private cells. Sometimes were in solitary confinement, sometimes in public prison. We work, eat , shit and think why are we here and where and when we did wrong to be forced in this place. We learnt to enjoy this imprisonment to make this suffering and sadness bearable. We wrote books, novels , stories . We created religions to portrait this prison as a beautiful place and a jailor that wants good for us if we follow the rules of this prison. And we made so many religions for every tastes and ages. We created entertainment because at the end of the long ass day, you have to forget why we are chained between these walls. We created countries, borders and we separated prisoners by their color, language, race , nationality,.... We started wars , killing and torturing eachother in the name of defending of our stupid walls, identity, religion and gens. We stepped on eachother, in the name of success and fame inside this prison. We created so many ""busyness"" to make an army of consumers to just work nonsense and spend on nonsense inorder to make ourselves an important person to other persons in this big prison. We started enjoying this prison for as it is, then we created marriage and families and made many babies. We created so many meanings, theories and problems that we forgot we are actually in a prison and the only purpose a prisoner must have to get free as soon as possible. Nobody has left this prison, there is no outer space.

Death is the only door to the FreeDome.

1703293914.0,"""We are so small in the universe""","People often compare humans (let's say 2m tall) against the size of stars (3 terameters), or galaxies ( 52,850 light years) or even the observable universe (28.5 gigaparsecs). Sizes so unimaginably big that comprehension breaks down and you can't really know what that means.  


But we don't seem to look down. Look closely, an ant (50mm), or a grain of sand (0.5mm). Looking down even further: Black mold spores (\~60 µm), Lactobacillus (1.5 µm). Even further: Herpes Virus (120 nm), Covid-19 Spike (20nm), DNA strand width (2.5nm).  
Looking down beyond the scale of biological processes: Oganesson Atom (\~304 pm), Hydrogen Atom (120pm), Proton (833 Attometers), Quarks (Essentially points), Planck Particle (\~6PL) and the Planck Length (1.6 \* 10\^(-35)m)  


The Planck Length is around the smallest length our current laws of physics work and where we would need a unified model of physics (combining gravity, and quantum mechanics) to understand anything happening smaller than this.  


To put that in comparison to the universe the 

Planck Length is \~ 100 DECILLION times smaller than us. 

While the observable universe is only \~100 Septillion times bigger than us  


The Planck length is 1 BILLION times smaller than the universe is bigger than us. We are so, so, so, so, so big in comparison to the Planck Length. If you ever feel small, then you should know: You are so big in this universe, you're 1 Billion times bigger than even just the middle.

So I’m trying to think of the topics people usually run into on this topic and so far I have:

* Why live?
* Why God doesn’t matter
* Why nothing matters
* Why not hedonism?
* Why not existentialism?
* Why not stoicism?
* Why ask why?

Honestly the whole “why” aesthetic was accidental but I kind of like it considering how much torment the question “why” caused me over the decades before I learned to let it go.

Anyway, curious what’s missing. I feel like I hit the big things we usually see here but curious about what you might think is missing.

Update: fresh ideas from the threads go here

* Why endure suffering?
* Why appreciate anything?
* Why take anything seriously?
* Why should I believe my senses? (Spoiler: you shouldn’t)
* Why is life neither good nor bad?
* Why do anything?
* Why life sucks and is also great
* Hearing what you want to hear
* One of Optimistic Nihilism’s biggest goals - being good with mortality - embrace life, embrace death
* Why your logic is probably BS (and you’ll cringe at the memory of it later)

Late updates: ideas that pop into my head over time that I go back to this post and write down for myself later on

* It’s not that there’s no God, it’s that it doesn’t really matter - aka “Why it doesn’t matter if there’s a God”
* One of Optimistic Nihilism’s biggest goals - being good with mortality - embrace life, embrace death
* Why your logic is probably BS (and you’ll cringe at the memory of it later)

At least for now, I need a god to walk with me.  I recognize my humanity, my fragility, my necessity for god.  Life is too much without it.  I need to trust that my best is good enough for someone.  I need to trust that I’m good enough.  I need to feel loved and cared for and accepted.  I need god.  Not for god or for others but for me.  For my own peace, I need to believe in something greater than myself.  Life is far too chaotic and unprocessable without it.  I need the humility to acknowledge that my intellect is not sufficient.  That I cannot reason myself out of my humanity.  That every culture since the dawn of time has created a god because it needed it to navigate life as much as we developed eyes and legs and brains.

1703213617.0,Nihilism is misleading… here’s why.,"EDIT: *Nihilism as a means to justify suicide is stupid*

ni·hil·ism : the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.

Congrats, your intelligence led you to the fact that there is no god and no one is forcing you to adhere to moral principles! What now?

Simply because there is no god, doesn’t mean that life is “meaningless”. There does not need to be any meaning at all. Suicide is most definitely NOT the answer.

Why don’t animals commit suicide? It’s because they are too busy surviving. They’re just ooking for food and stimuli. When you’re actually struggling to survive is when you actually want to live. Ironically, when life is too easy, we want to die. 

The answer is to make life harder for yourself. All the social media, video games, junk foods, cheap entertainment you consume is killing your will to live.

What are morals? A code set by society to follow. Chimpanzees follow the morals of their group because if they don’t they’ll be exiled. That’s why morals exist. You don’t have to abide by the macro moral compass of whatever religion your society proposes, but you should probably abide by the basic rules like don’t steal, murder, or lie to your friends. 

It takes above average intelligence to realize the truths to nihilism. It takes even more intelligence to realize that “meaning” is subjective and you can hack your own neurochemistry to actually feel happy/content most of the time.",0

Humans have turned more into awful people over the years and the hypocrisy drives me up the wall and makes me want to retreat to a forest to care for animals and garden.
Anyways. My brother got engaged recently but the past year all he did was trash talk his now fiancé. I think it’s disgusting and I’m really tired of humans getting married and bringing new people into the world if they don’t even like them… it feels so selfish and wrong..
Every once in a while I’m pleasantly suprised with kind people but for the most part everyone is kind of a hypocrite :/ I don’t mind flaws what I can’t stand about humanity is the lying about them (example: everyone will find someone, if you work hard you’ll get a good job) that’s just not true so I don’t know why we keep lying to generations pretending everything is fine…

Anyway on to the point 

Here’s the issue- my constant not lying gets me in trouble.
I cannot keep my mouth shut. If someone says something that’s an obvious lie I will call them out, so if my brother decides he wants to pretend it’s been nothing but sunshine and butterflies I’ll have absolutely no issue bringing up the girl he wanted to date a few months ago in front of his fiancé.
I don’t mean to be cruel even though it sounds like it.

But really:

Do you know how unlikely is for an intelligent being to exist? Especially one *cough* with a mindset similar to humans. Humans build a golden statue and they worship it instead of worshipping you? Destroy them!!! People don't believe in you? Torture them!


Think about: You are rare for comprehending the world in the way you do. But a god that is omnipotent, in an universe of anarchy?

Take a look at the universe. Scientific formulas prove everything, from black holes, gravity, worm holes, all the stuff in the universe. The big bang is an accurate theory, that proves the existence of the universe. 

You think you are so unique? This universe appeared, there are likely more. In different realms. The probability of this is insane.

Matter is easy to comprehend. You are born, you die. There is no activity in your brain when you die, there was none where you were not here. As simple as that (it also sounds depressing, but it's the reality). Matter can appear out of nowhere, even if it is impossible. What was before the universe? Nobody knows. If a question can't be answered, it can't be answered. What is very suspicious is the existence of infinite-intelligent being, that did not go through the process of evolution, and rules with an iron fist, and ..... a human mind. That's right! A being with an infinite amount of intelligence and power simply can't act this way. Matter appearing out of nowhere is pretty natural. I mean, there would be a low chance of it not appearing, after the infinite amount of the time nothingness was there.

And nothingness is simply nothingness. And that's it. 

On evolution: Just look at how similar the human hand is to the monkey hand. And all species share DNA in common. If a god created things randomly, they should share no dna.

On the reasons why jesus acted the way he did: Oh, the Jesus argument. 

You know, there are different people with different reasons for how they act.

Picture: The people that started dancing fanatically without any reasons on the streets of the Holy Roman Empire. 

A bunch of people that broke out in laughter for no reason, and did not stop.

Schizophrenia.


Yes, all of those happened, so why wouldn't there be someone who would sacrifice himself for a reason, greater than him.

You should also consider the myers briggs theory, a theory that explains the way people perceive reality.

Jesus was an INFJ. Hitler was one too. Both did things out of the ordinary, but at the end of the day, this is how people are built.


Micro-level evidence, like magical rocks or something? These are elements present in other religions too, and similar stories of miracles are present, in other religions too, pagan included. Humans have a natural tendency to fight for things bigger than themselves.

1702793650.0,I think I'm starting to get it (i used to hate optimistic nihilism),"I used to absolutely despise the ""nothing matters, so why not?"" of optimistic nihilism. I used to think that it's just nothing but contradictory millennial pseudo-optimistic copium meant to give Medium article writers something to write about when they're running out of ideas. 

I was skeptical of how, for some reason, since there's no reason to be sad, we might as well be happy. I thought that was stupid as fuck, because I thought that even when there seems to be no reason to be sad, people can still be fucking miserable from time to time, and when some people try to do something that could bring them any sort of joy, it may not even work at all. I then realized that it's just my depression being projected onto my worldview without even realizing it. I realized that if there was really no reason to be sad other than brain chemical fuckery, then it's simply best to just get help.

I was also skeptical of the whole ""nothing matters, which includes your mistakes, so you shouldn't care about them!"" I thought that even in a meaningless world, consequences of one's actions still exist. I thought that it's selfish and careless in the worst way possible to not care about one's mistakes, because I thought that it would just stagnate one's personal growth. Then I realized that it's just my self-conscious dumbass that tends to beat themselves up over every little mistake, no matter how insignificant it may be. Also, I got over the whole ""if nothing matters, then why not do crime????"" thing by realizing that if that were the case, every single person on this subreddit would've been on the FBI's most wanted list.

&#x200B;

All of that skepticism towards optimistic nihilism changed when two months ago, I had a falling out with someone. I won't spare you the exact details, but basically, I said something incredibly fucking stupid, and they blocked me for it. A month or two later, I tried apologizing to them again. They basically told me that I was talking out of my ass, and cut me off again. When that happened, I felt absolutely devastated. I felt absolutely suicidal, just because I felt as if I was beyond redemption. I wanted to believe that I could redeem myself somehow, and it felt as if my entire life, or even the entire world hinged on that very incident. I also wanted to get to know them better, because truth be told, we didn't really chatted much. I would've called them a friend at the time, but I do that for most people I talk to. So even though we didn't know each other that well, I still felt as if I messed up by basically losing someone due to my own bullshit. Thus, I wished for death. I felt as if I didn't deserve to live. I've always been self-loathsome about my own mistakes, especially since I was only 17 at the time (I had only just turned 18 in fact). I thought at that age, I should've done something about my behavior, but it felt as if I was rotting from the inside out. It felt as if the universe just wants me to know that I'm a hopeless fucking idiotic disgrace of a human being.

&#x200B;

Two months later, I had an epiphany. None of that bullshit matters anymore. If we really are just a bunch of specks of dust, or whatever, then what good is to me if I'm going to let one singular mistake define me? What good is it to prove to that singular person that I'm trying to be a better person? I can just do that. Besides, that person is going to forget about me in a few months. Again, we never really chatted much, so it's not like there was an attachment there. I just hated the idea of losing someone, especially if it's over something stupid that I did, because I just hate losing people. I felt the same way when me and my online best friend drifted apart not too long ago, and I wasn't able to reconnect with him. Although I didn't feel worthless about myself when that happened, I still felt empty.  


I then realized that the idea that we need to be perfect people or that we need to completely change our behavior from something that is different to what we used to be has been holding me back for way longer than it should have. Again, we shouldn't let our mistakes define who we are and make ourselves seem worthless than we actually are, especially if the aftermath of those mistakes won't matter in the end. I also felt as if the idea that we need to always forgive other people for the shit that they do has been holding me back as well. Looking back, it felt weirdly entitled of me to expect forgiveness from just that person alone. As if I was the center of the universe, or something. I'm just a speck of dust in the vast universe, why should they, or even the universe itself, give a shit? At this point, I should've been forgiving myself this whole time.

I also realized that even the people you love the most are going to drift away from you one way or another. It won't even be because you had bad blood between them. It just happens. It's just the way it is. That's life. If you had a good relationship with that person, then just be happy that you met them in the first place! If you had a falling out with that person, then you can simply let go of any resentment for them by realizing that it won't even matter. 

&#x200B;

I dunno, it felt freeing once I realized that. I felt a serene sense of contentment knowing that I can simply let go of who I was. Not that it matters, I guess?

A continuous search for the meaning of life, how to be successful, how to be wealthy, how to feel secure in myself. I just don't know anymore. Life just feels like a meaningless, sick joke where there are no real winners. What is the point of everything anyway? A consistent and constant cycle of 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. 

Everytime I try to get back to the disciplined version of myself I quickly lose motivation, discipline and hope. My body is in constant pain and I'm only 26. I work a job I hate for a boss that is a dumbass. The job crushes me physically and holds me back from being able to exercise, which is something I enjoy.

 I've completely given up on love and relationships. They feel like a futile waste of time where you either end up heartbroken, sick of each other, or in a constant state of self-consciousness. To me, women are difficult to understand and there is all this pressure to be strong, masculine and Alpha. You can never let your guard down or take offence to their words or actions. The divide between men and women is now huge and the sexes are being turned against each other for good. 

My faith in God is gone. I turned away from him. I thought Christianity would make me happy, but just like everything else, it didn't. I give up so easily. I'm full of shit and my mind changes like the seasons. I even have been looking into the dark side (occult) and their practices. It feels like drugs have truly fucked my mind up for good. Life is a constant pendulum swinging between feeling shit, and feeling bored. 

I've never felt good enough. I'm extremely insecure and try to gain insight and knowledge from scumbags like Andrew Tate. I think I'll be alone forever. All my attemps at dating and relationships have gone to shit, and I'm the common denominator. It's getting to point where I don't want to pursue women altogether. 

I feel like I'm never going to make it in this life. Forever lost, forever hopeless. Mind destroyed by porn, alcohol, drugs, and the internet in general. Life is meaningless. If there is a God, he has never shown himself to me or answered my prayers. I'm so lost. A lost boy in a man's body. Reliant on others, with no drive to save myself. What is the fucking point?

IE anyone who can experience things they like or dislike deserves happiness and satisfaction and that kinda stuff and deserves not to suffer. it boils down to it being something u personally like though so if u wanted to experience horror or sadness for horror or sadness sake alone that is good in my view. its rly subjective and i treat some things as less good than other things that fit the same criteria of being something someone likes. but i do have a moral view, whether you think its a shitty view or not is irrelevent. i do really care about my view and take it seriously.

the problem is the ""i extend that to others"" part. or even living life normally. im an epistemic nihilist. that means i dont believe i can know things. i believe in truth and knowledge on SOME level. things like logic and existing in the current moment are undeniable to me. the problem is not knowing i can trust my senses, that even if i could trust them to what degree i would be able to, or knowing how likely it is that i was born last week. the problem is things like this fit in to the camp of not being impossible or able to cross out from the human perspective. i certainly cant prove that its impossible. all i think i can do is say theres a chance of any of these things being true, and i dont see any reason to say the chance is low either. and theres infinite conceptually possible things like this.

i can choose to act on my instinctual belief that it would be beneficial for me to engage in the world as though science is true and my long term memories are atleast semi true with the exception of degrading and stuff. but do i see a way i can justify acting that way? no. so whats the alternative? a void existence just taking the backseat and never doing anything i dont feel like i have to or want to do? i think maybe i can justify acting as though i wasnt born 5 seconds ago just from the fact that if im going to have any goal or live in any good or even self beneficial way i have to act as though i have an understanding of what i would like or dislike doing. otherwise i couldnt say eating food will taste good or make my hunger or urge go away. its like, if it WERE true that i was just born it wouldnt matter if i take it to be true or not anyway so i'd might as well assume my memories are true to an extent that i can make beneficial decisions. but thats still a void existence. i could still deny lots of memories at any time if theyre unnecessary for my happiness. why treat memories as though theyre consistent or accurate? even regular people believe their memories are inaccurate to a varying degree. theres no reason to set the precedent that because i have to accept some memories are legitimate that it means i must accept all memories. the only thing challenging that view is the irrational unfounded belief that curses me with anxiety and stress. the belief that something i do will actually be bad for me in the long term.

so then how, when staring in to the void, do you extend your beliefs to others? well it seems to me that to be consistent in my belief that i cant justify the existence of others, i'd might as well just be selfish. if anyone has any objections to my flavor of epistemic nihilism, then by all means. its not like i want to see things this way.",0

1702350377.0,It seems like we have no control over our life,"After some contemplation. I have realized, in reality, **that I have no control over my life.** My brain is the true mastermind behind everything. I would say currently I am just surviving. I don't have a large group of friends, haven't done anything relationship-wise, weak social and educational skills from lack of education (went to an all-boys religious school with little focus on secular studies), but I am also in a good situation where my physiological and safety needs are met. I would say I am just living, but not doing anything with my life. I just came into existence because of my parents choosing to have kids. I got caught up in some sadistic thoughts on why to do anything at all. Everyone seems to say you should chase a fulfilling life, but I asked why. Why choose a life fulfilling over a non-fulfilling life? This lead me to the realization, that whatever I do, my brain and body is the one that chooses the set of options.

Therefore, whether I choose to live a fulfilling life or not. My brain is going to control what I do with myself. **The only reason why I want to live a fulfilling life is to make my brain happy and the only reason not to do it is because my brain will then try to make itself happy through bad mechanisms. Why make the brain happy at all?** It seems like the brain is our only way of interacting with reality. It has set the options of how we are supposed to live our lives. However, some of the main issues with this are: 1, your potentiality is defined by things outside of your control, 2 the things to actualize your potentiality are also outside of your control, and these 2 things led me to the realization that you don't control what your destiny is and it is defined by your brain, and even if you do choose a destiny set by your brain you don't have much control over achieving it.   


Even though I don't think that I am going through depression, I thought about self-annihilation as being the cure to this problem, but it isn't. If you self-end yourself are then left with 2 options. Option 1, there is an afterlife and you still have little control over your outcome in the afterlife, or option 2 is you go into non-being and cease to exist. This seems like to not fix the problem at all, as you can't attribute anything to non-being, so it's basically useless and you are dealing with the same existential problems.

1702328966.0,Nihilism makes life MORE meaningful,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments seeming to say that nihilism makes life meaningless, depressing, bleak, and empty. This is a misunderstanding of what is meant by *objective* meaning versus *subjective* meaning. 

Here I will use *meaning*, *purpose*, and *value* interchangeably though I do not think they are entirely equivalent, I'll leave that for a different discussion. 

*Subjective* meaning is that value system an individual assigns to their own existence, experiences, and relationships. It is an entirely personal internal value system. 

*Objective* meaning implies some kind of greater purpose or plan to reality and existence which in turn implies some kind of being who could create plans and purpose, some kind of universal schemer. If we reject the idea of *the divine* or any kind of god, and admit our observations indicate a mechanical universe, then the idea of an objective meaning of existence becomes absurd. In this way atheism leads directly to existential nihilism in philosophical thought. 


In nihilism we reject the very idea of any *objective* meaning. 

Let's consider a mathematic analogy:

If the total meaning of existence is equal to Subjective Meaning + Objective meaning then we need to determine the values. A strictly deterministic view of reality puts all of the value in objective meaning and denies any value to subjective meaning. However, if we instead say that there is no objective meaning possible at all, then that leaves all the meaning and value that can exist in subjective meaning. The subjective meaning is infinitely valuable as it contains all concepts of value. 

If we arrange our lives such that we imagine it's value is *less* than an imagined *eternal reward* then the meaning and value of our lives here is diminished. If we imagine that our lives only value is to receive some reward after death and our actions here are only to achieve this reward, we have removed all intrinsic value from our lives, and turned them into a commodity to trade for this imagined (and entirely lacking in any objective evidence) after life. It is easy to see how religious extremism causes believers to throw their lives away, often violently taking other with them, to get this *reward*

Metaphysical eternal reward systems devalue human life, nihilism makes subjective meaning the only kind that exists. When it's all we have it's value is infinite. 

Now let's consider the economics of time:

If I tell you you have one month left to live, what does that do to the value of each day? I would say economics dictates that it increases the value of each day massively. If I tell you you have one hundred years left to live what does that do to the value of each day? What of 100,000 years? What of infinite time?

If time and existence is infinite it's value drops infinitely, it is the limited nature of our time that directly gives it subjective value for us. Supply and Demand. 

Every single moment of existence is subjectively infinitely  valuable *specifically* because there is no objective meaning.

Your existence, and your ability to differentiate between X being better or worse than Y, is contingent on being human. 

Therfore, I can make an ethical claim that embraced meaninglessness is actually wrong. You should not live that way, because in order to do so you must throw out your ability to use mental hierarchies to make decisions. It's logically incoherent. Since no one really can live that way, and the world would cease to function if everyone did so (i.e Kant's universalizability principle), existential nihilism is wrong. 

You have convinced yourself that you KNOW your place in the universe, but that doesn't mean you have a legit claim to a deeper understanding of reality. 

Staring into the abyss is about voluntarily looking at the darkest part of your own being, becoming aware of your own tendency towards self deception and evil. Then you have enough awareness to choose good and truth.

General statement of nihlism goes like ""There is nothing meaningful in life"" or ""nothing has meaning"". If you truly are aligned with this line, I mean it, to the very core. Then you realise that the line ""nothing has meaning"" or ""there is no meaning in life"" is meaningless as well. And your very thoughts loses meaning too, the process of thinking, loses its flair, unless you define a definite goal, and understand that, that goal is meaningless.


The above statements align well with Buddhists principle of *Sansara*(universe) and how it is made of *Maya*(illusion). And we are in this *Maya jaal*(web of illusion). Let me define this in nihlistic perspective. For example someone thinks, ""this thing has no meaning"" and keep on repeating that. Then visual representation of it would be like this.

1
1
1
1
.... Upto infinity 

I have defined above 1 as a loop, where person is defining everything as meaningless. Now, then the person says, ""oh, me defining things as meaningless is meaningless"". The person has created another loop.

1
1-1
1-1-1
1-1-1-1
... to infinity

And thus defining everything as meaningless, person get stuck in this web of meaninglessness. It's a web of intellectual pride. How do you know that you are stuck in it? When you know that there is something in this world which doesn't align with what you stated and for that you have to observer very carefully.


This is where the concept of being true comes. A true scientist discard his ego, which makes binds him with particular dogma, so that he can actually know. Similar is the experience of true religious one, he who discard every religious dogma and keep in the search for god, which results in death of ego.


Why is it so tough to be true? Isn't it because of our pride, our ego which tells us, that what we have found is of supreme, of the maximum essance. Even though, we are not the one who found it, they are passed on ideas, which ""I"" have pondered over. The ""we"" or ""I"" in equation don't exist, when it comes to thoughts, or do they? But, what I am sure of is, when we hang on to these thoughts our perception become blurry, which stops the pursuit of truth. And if you want to seek truth, it it exist, it's proper that you lose this ego.",0

1702191691.0,"Destined to mediocrity, closer to the edge than ever","For the theory of evolution, modern man's creator, genesis and god, to work, inevitably we all start out in life with a combination of unchangeable hereditary traits, some of which are objectivly better (->better predictors of success) than others.

This means that, before we are born, we are either assigned a high value genetic profile, or not.

Examples like IQ, sociability (yes, extremly hereditary), height, attractiveness etc. come to mind. There are even genes related to how hard your able to work, which I find to be the most butal one. 

It even get's worse: Instead of those genes being assigned fairly, to balance each other out, or at least being assigned randomly, good/bad genes often are concentrated among each other in individuals, because the genetic quality of your ancestors determined the genetic quality of the mate they were able to attract. 

While this MUST hold true for the theroy of evolution to work, our society at large seems extremly oblivious to this: We are all hold to nearly the same standarts of success in our careers and social life.

1702140266.0,Unearthing Magic Post-Nihilism,"
My last post on Reddit was written in the depth of my own darkness. I’ve gone through a lot of loss and grief over the last few years, and I started to see nihilism and, quite frankly, apathy, as the only solution. But I’ve come out of that since and thought I’d share. I know those of you still swept into nihilism as a seemingly permanent state will not appreciate what I’ve written below. But maybe someone will. I believe wholeheartedly still in the necessity of nihilism. But I do believe Nietzsche never intended nihilism to be an end goal, rather a stepping stone of shedding before being born into something new—the childlike spirit we often neglect. 

Alas:

“What, in fact, do we know about the peak experience? Well, to begin with, we know one thing that puts us several steps ahead of the most penetrating thinkers of the 19th century: that P.E’.s are not a matter of pure good luck or grace. They don’t come and go as they please, leaving ‘this dim, vast vale of tears vacant and desolate’. Like rainbows, peak experiences are governed by definite laws. They are ‘intentional’.”
Colin Wilson

Often mystical experiences are attributed to people steeped in religion. It’s rare you hear about an atheist consumed by wonder and glory. And I think it’s because religious people have a clear narrative to life, death, and personhood. Their own subjectivity becomes wrapped up in an overarching objective narrative that is outside of them. They simply mold themselves into this pre-existing narrative with blueprints for mystical experiences. A sort of contextualism.

For those of us who are not religious, mystical experiences are fought for, earned. And I believe the foundation of these experiences lies in the creation of a narrative. I’ve touched on it briefly in previous posts this week, how knowing our death (or at least being mindful of it) can help us create a narrative arc for our own life — when we see a definitive “end” we can shape the middle with more fervor. It’s when we lose sight of the climax and the last page that we get lost in the lagging middle.

I don’t mean that mystical experiences are self-constructionist endeavors. I think it only starts in self-constructionism. But I do believe that it must start there. It must begin with your own narrative – the life story you design for yourself.

This is where I believe intelligence and knowingness come in. Going into the depths of yourself — your mind, your heart, your every thought and fear. There’s deconstruction involved here — ego dissolution. Dare I say … nihilism. The complete shedding of all pre-conceived beliefs, notions, fears, loves. Shed them, and sit in the darkness of nihilism, of complete darkness, alone.

Sit there. Just sit there. Not creating. Not avoiding. Just experiencing it — intentional passivity— letting it happen to you, letting it consume you until you are no more.

This is not for the faint of heart and I think when people throughout history spoke of this post-nihilistic enlightened state, they deemed it rare because it is. It involves an insanely brave level of self-awareness — self-awareness that can be honest with itself in both directions. Neither too grandiose or too self-deprecating. Honest. With the self. And intelligent enough to deconstruct and reconstruct the self without guidance. This is not easy. It’s not for the faint of heart or mind. And it’s rare.

However, post-darkness, if the person can rise from this darkness reborn, the true narrative of Self is made. Shaped by the Self. And the Self only.

After this it gets fun. Because once that place in life is found — mysticism can unfurl as a garden reaching the sky. It can transform the entire way you perceive the world. Magic is born. No religion necessary. And though I adore neuroscience and its many explanations for all things human — I don’t know if this comes down to plasticity or biology. I don’t know enough on the science of this to speak much on it, but from personal experience I can say that this is beyond the mind.

Begins in the mind, but the true mystical way is found when we allow our minds to expand beyond our mind. We step out of our mind. Not in a passive way. It’s very much active. It’s very much intentional. But it’s outside of us where we find the true brightness and wonder of life.

So deconstruction, self-construction, and then a stepping out and beyond. I’m not even sure how I can explain the method for this, other than … when you get there you’ll know.

What I can say, however, is that like the religious, you need a narrative in order to find this place. A story you write of your life that you actually believe. And if you can’t see the point in that yet, then you haven’t fully deconstructed. Because when you deconstruct you are at a life or death moment. You either reconstruct or die — die before you’re dead or kill yourself because you can find no point in living. But if you’ve deconstructed and want to find life again … you will reconstruct and it’s there, after your self-written narrative, that you will be able to expand inward and outward and discover that “air of mysticism” in your own life.

We create the fertile ground for mystical experiences, with our self-constructionist narrative, but it’s only the fertile ground we provide. The rest happens naturally as we allow it. A conscious choice to welcome the seeds and watch the garden reach toward the sky. If we are alert, ready, primed, and wanting … it simply happens. But not without awareness and intention. Magic must be fought for and earned. A life or death battle for Brightness.

1702078681.0,"There's people who think they can change the world, but all that really happens is the world ends up changing them","It's a sad truth, about idealistic individuals. They start out young, looking at laws that they find unjust. Perhaps they even have an ounce of optimism: they see the politicians, they see their neighbor have opposing viewpoints. I can change them! I can get that law passed. Then their midlife passes, they realize they can maybe make a dent in their local politics... Maybe a call to the local congressman MIGHT get to voicemail, that email to whoever controls the tax tarrifs might get a read... soon enough after decades of work, they look back at what they've accomplished. A degree or a masters, or whatever, not much else. Sure there's some work that was done, but was any of it really remembered? Did they make the headlines at any point about this change which they thought was so good for whatever cause it was, it doesn't matter. You don't need specifics. All you can see around you is a society parading about entertainment, obsessed with the latest version of beauty that contradicts what was beautiful a century before. 

And sadly, as this idealistic individual ages, which they must, their mind ages as well. And with an aged mind comes more introspection (usually) - and if you haven't accomplished what your past self clung to hope to, you turn into a bitter person who will admit ""I once thought we could solve the potholes on the highway, now I'll settle for a sidewalk that is walkable next to my house""

This world wears the most hopeful of us down. It's pointless. Trying your hardest to do much of anything here but serve your own narrative and means doesn't make sense. It's chaotic, different persons and viewpoints constantly barrading each other. That's why a new law takes two decades to get past the various lobbying and fillabuster crap which happens.

2) I once heard that people who are most discontent with society and the world often view the entire situation objectively. If this means they are more depressed or anxious than most, wouldn't that allow them to see it from a more neutral standpoint?

3) I don't even know if I'd call myself a nihilist as I do not follow many of the ideations, and I certainly don't believe this species should involuntarily go extinct - or anything in that realm at all. (Not saying that's what it means to be a nihilist at all, but certainly how the rest of Reddit views it.) What I *do* believe is that it may be better for the future sanity of *us* but also the state of the natural world and all other animals/species if we go extinct naturally. From something like a super volcano, or astroid, or whatever else.

4) The above scenario is only most desirable if it occurs while we're still this primitive; if we're expected to get dumber or last a lot longer at our current intelligence (1000s of years), it may not be worth it. I personally believe it would take 10s of thousands of years for us to ""stop being so primitive"" and work together, smarter, like it is believed to be required for survival on Earth and spreading to other parts of the universe.

He saw that most of them, in common with their cast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries. Warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal sensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found fault with the social order. Never could they realise that their brute foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of chidhood and innocence."" 

\- Excerpt from '*The Silver Key*,' by H.P. Lovecraft

I was around 19 years old (I'm 34 today) and I remember going to the library near my house to look for some Lovecraft books. I had seen a Japanese horror/thriller movie called ""Goth"" in which, in one scene, the woman in the lead role appears reading a Lovecraft book. I got interested, and when I was leafing through one of his books, I read exactly that paragraph you posted. I remember well my first impression after reading the paragraph. At first it took me a while to organize my understanding of what was written, then I felt a slight relief and a small joy at finally having found something in which I could identify with what I had been feeling for some time.

I'm a new father, this has been the first year of my child's life. I have also just gotten married this year as well. 

Over the past couple of weeks I've been in this huge pit of despair, suicidal, numb and hazy. I don't know where it's coming from, but I feel useless, I feel like everyone looks down on me. I cant do a simple task without confusion, I question myself too much and feel anxiety with every task. I don't feel close to my wife, or anybody for that matter but my son. 

I try to remind myself of my belief, this is all meaningless, but I choose to live in the absurdity. I live here for my son, I will continue to exist for him. I just don't want him to grow up with a self-loathing dad who couldn't keep shit together. 

Im trying to take steps to get better, keeping in less-stressful situations. Relaxing alittle more, doing stuff I enjoy. But I'm constantly on the verge of crying, nihilism keeps me grounded. It brings me comfort, I hope it does the same for you too.

1701446742.0,“Life is meaningless” is much less true of a statement than “Meaning is created”.,"i was just reflecting on how the statement “life is meaningless” is both less true and less useful than the rarely heard “meaning is created”. 

even though at face value, to most nihilists both would seem equally true, it is more accurate to say that meaning is created, than to say it is nonexistent. if we conscious beings exist in the universe, and meaning is something our consciousness is experiencing, then meaning actually does exist, and even in a very objective sense. its just *created*, by causes, conditions, and connections through space and time which carry significance within a being’s consciousness. meaning can only be said to ultimately not exist, if one is willing to claim that consciousness ultimately does not exist. 

from the perspective of a conscious being who’s aware that it’s nervous system (or other feeling apparatus) is capable of meaning-making and of reaping real, measurable benefits from that for both oneself and other beings, life is utterly full of opportunities to make meaning. 

it would never occur to a being with such a mode of awareness to conclude that just because meaning is a flexible creation of conscious beings, it somehow *doesn’t exist*. 

and, at least in the real of human beings, it appears there are certain states of being — creativity, generosity, receiving gratitude, connecting deeply — which create meaning for the benefit of many. and the biological, electrochemical, electromagnetic mechanisms that underlie all those experiences, do not somehow erase the conscious being experiencing them and the fact that there is indeed a conscious being, just like you, experiencing them. 

from “meaning is created”, you aren’t forfeiting the game or pretending you don’t exist. you are made aware of the game and invited to play.",0

1701432265.0,"Questioning existence, why the design of life is evil","lets talk about the design of the world, I can understand how there is a general design to life, as in the way living beings live, herbivores, carnivores, ecosystems, heaven above and earth below as the elements that make up the world, earth, water, fire, wood, air, space...

my point is there is a underlying design to the world but there is also not much of a design in terms of what occurs and how the world moves or atleast its not apparent to us, world is basically just ""created"" and let go to be itself.

everything is extremely random, let alone evolution but life itself is random, you cannot choose what parents you are born with, you cannot choose what person you become or the circumstances you live in, no one in the world can know wheter the life of someone will be easy or difficult, you can be here today and dead in a car crash tomorrow, its very unpredictable.

like it is very hard to know how things will go or to predict them, you can feel the happiest today before feeling full of sorrow tomorrow, you can have been feeling healthy for years before unexpectedly falling sick for a long period of time...

of course, I do not disagree that there is an underlying system of things, a fish knows how to swim instinctively, a buffalo knows how to walk, eat, reproduce, we know when we are hungry or what we need, I know how to use my fingers to type this instinctively although yes it could be debated wheter I am really in control or not and wheter free will is there or not or wheter its all predetermined or not.

its very mysterious what existence is.

my underlying problem with the world is its impermenance, I tried to accept that and I can talk about it but it feels there is a human side to things that make one feel attached to things and this attachment inevitably leads to suffering.

we can talk about how suffering is an aspect of life but it still hits hard, in the middle of suffering, no matter how you rationalise it, it doesn't work, there are ways to cope but it seems there is an inherent way human beings are.

thats why I have always questioned specifically why such a design?

lets just rule out mental suffering but even physical suffering, lets just get out of human society for a second, lets go to nature.

in nature, you can never guarentee shelter nor food, you can be eaten at any moment, let alone the amount of starving animals and those just dying because of natural disasters like drought..

animals are forced to eat each other to survive, they have miserable lives, one injury is enough to seal their fates, their whole existence is chasing to eat to not starve and reproduce, a herbivore has to always be in the lookout before being devoured yet even the being who devoured it, lets say the mountain lion, even it was starving and needed food to survive and even as it survives it has to constantly kill to be granted a continued life and not to die of starvation.

at some point you gotta question, what's the point of it all?

just don't have a world, why create an impermanent world that's so full of suffering and especially create emotional beings within it?

we can all talk about how humans could withstand all these hardships of life but I cannot help but its misery pure and simply, there will always be pain and suffering.

my point is this, all Beings are Pure and innocent, from the murderer to the robber to the killer to the saint to the most good to most pure evil, from the most human to the most inhumane, from animals to human beings, all Pure

even the most notorious serial killer was just a child one day and even if he had a mental problem that mental problem itself is a problem in the design of how he was made not of his own fault.

to me, it is the very Design of the world that I see is inherently evil, of course there is no line demarcating good from evil, they can be in each other and there is no law defining them but still...

we are pretty much slaves to our programming

we often times want to be good, even suffer from our own evil but that side nonetheless cannot be denied, we also often don't have much of a choice.

Should I go blame a country for invading another? but ressources are limited and they are necessary to maintain one's nation.

Should I blame humanity for polluting the earth? but pollution was necessary to rise up from the misery of life and whole economies and people depend on pollution to survive.

Should one go blame the mass genociders? but whats the difference between them and a tornado decimating a city, yes they are human and? there is no difference between genocide and a tsunami, its the same manifestation of the world at different scales

of course these terms are very vague themselves but again, lets just take human beings..

is there even a single person who wants to hurt others just for the sake of it? Not really in a sane human being, most people would choose peace if possible but point is ressources are limited, things move and change constantly.

there always has to be a reason for these ""bad"" things and this reason right here is the very design of the world.

there is no difference between you killing a nest of hornets and a tornedo ravaging a city, its just the same phenomena on a very different scale.

but even if you didn't kill the hornets nest, these type of things are the very rule of the world. they are bound to happen no matter what you do.

you eat animals to survive and when you will die, other organisms will feed on you as well.

there is no problem with that but I find human beings were somehow of a mistake of the world, although animals suffer they do not have the cognition to have deeper experiences, to know more, to attach to people, to love, to experience, to desire more...

But Yes of course, there is also goodness in it, there is love, there is beauty in the world and these things are worth it

but I find that pain, suffering, impermanence completely spoils this beauty and goodness, not enough for me to completely nihilistic but enough for me to despise the way of things.

in front of such a world, all you can do is be still and let go of things.

to flow like water uncaring of whatever the fuck happens, not because its most efficient, you think all a person cares about is efficiency?

there are too many elements at play to try and grab an outcome, no one can grab gain or loss, you can save loads of money yet still end up homeless, you can do everything in your power yet still fail, anyone who ever succeeded was lucky because they first had the circumstances of being able to bring such a thing into existence as well as survivor bias.

but of course one must try anyway since one has no choice but one shouldn't be attached to outcome atleast for me, do it what you can in the present and leave the rest for fate

Human life with such thoughts makes the best way to live is to just let oneself be moved by the elements of the world and the winds of causation till the the body dies and one is back to freedom

although I do find that hardships can be good as they strengthen oneself and forge onself into a stronger more resilient as well as more wise version but I still find that it is at the expense of the person's perpetual suffering

I mean lets just take work, money, problems, sickness, unfairness, people and the elements that come into play into one's life, life is not easy! not at all, for no one and if you fight it, you will just make it harder but you will still have to fight anyway.

I do think that that's where the buddhist and hindu concept of non-attachment and renunciation of life came from.

water moves through holes, fills them up and moves on, like this I think man should move through predicaments, solve them and move through them without too much mental suffering or care, basically to be uncaring, to move through life unfettered and move on without unecessary conflict that just makes it even harder.",0

1701332774.0,Nihilistic arguments can be used to prove both atheism and Religion.,"So what I see that Westerners only believe nihilistic arguments to be a part of atheism but Indian religions used nihilistic arguments to debate atheists.

For example,

Ancient Empiricist Atheists- There is no evidence for your claims as we can not perceive Rebirth or Nirvana through the five senses and the five senses are only ways of knowing. Instead we should enjoy the material pleasures of world and focus on living.

Some Buddhist style arguments -

The things you call as material pleasures such as Food, Gold etc are made of parts and those parts are divided into further parts into atoms and molecules (Anu is the smallest unit of matter in Indian philosophy which cannot be seen through eyes). So what you call as Gold or Food is just a form acquired through combination of atoms and molecules and the form is not real only the parts are real.

What you have in life like marriage, beliefs and morality are combination of multiple parts of beliefs and views, something that you picked up from this world and so they do not matter. The form of belief that ""Life is Good"" is a form acquired through combination of these parts of beliefs. 

At the end everything you believe to be True is a combination of parts. So none of them is true when you seperate the parts.

Atheist- So what's the point of teaching your philosophy? Your philosophy must be Form of beliefs too.

""I am not taking a stance just refuting your claims. I don't want to prove anything except refutation of your claims"".

This is not nihilism exactly but this kind of arguments reduces every Truth we know into parts and refuting them.

Edit: This is not a rejection of Atheism. Just saying Nihilistic arguments can be used in favor of religions.

Edit 2:- ""Real"" means permanent and immortal. Anything that is impermanent is transient and has no meaning or Ultimate purpose. Thus it must be rejected like a Fantasy. Buddha didn't force his belief on anyone. He asked to question all authorities including Buddha himself. If anyone is satisfied then can follow Buddha otherwise they are free to do whatever they want. This proves Buddha was a Liberal and Critical Thinker who didn't care about Authorities.",0

I am a moral nihilist as well as a nihilist, and what annoys me is when I talk to people about it they say

""Oh then I could just kill your family or you then?"" 
And then they get all proud of themselves thinking they have somehow won.

When the answer to that is yes, sure you could murder me or my family, or you could decide to torture an orphan none of these things are 'bad' and none of them matter.

I wouldent kill my dog because I love my dog, but that doesn't mean killing my dog is a bad thing, as good or bad is just an opinion and holds no intrinsic truth.

Then they usualy go on to say

""How can you care about your dog or your family then?""

And the answer to that is that I have the meaningless baseless and pointless opinion that my dog is floofy and cute, just because I recognise the inaccuracy of my opinions, doesn't mean I don't have them.

Human morals are just a subject of our own evolution as a social species, a healthy dose of eugenics and societal brainwashing, they arent anything special, its just what randomly happend.

Another argument moralistic people make is,

""Without morals society wouldent exist""

And my answer to that is ""and?""

A society or civilization holds no value either, a valueless object (societies in this case) will not give value to another valueless system (morality)

That's like saying a key makes it possible to open a lock, therefore keys are incredibly important and without them you are not a human, it's a completely insane argument.

But by the time you have said all of this, the other person just ignores it.
Its like talking to a religious person, they don't want what your saying to be true, so they just pretend it isn't.

Third of all, I know that creating inherent meaning out of the world (and the existence of a Jesus) is directly contradictory to this thing, but still hear me out.

Agnostic Theism; belief in a God, accompanied by uncertainty that one exists. If it's not nihilistic, then what is it, for example, if you don't think that there's any meaning to the existence of a God, or of a system of morality, or of an afterlife. I mostly don't really live my life with an afterlife in mind either, and I wouldn't care if it didn't exist, but I believe in all of those concepts anyway (because indoctrination). 

Also, I haven't really perceived an objective moral meaning as incompatible to a lack of meaning, even though they are technically incompatible. I can't really explain it, but the most I can do is compare it to be more of a guideline than a rigid system. Does that sound strange? Idk.

1700146560.0,Emotions are an objective truth of reality.,"That human beings have emotional responses to our environments and experiences, which dictate a large amount if not at some level all of our behavior, is an objective truth. That these emotions frame our lives and the quality of our lives, and highly influence the quality of life for all the humans we see and interact with, is objectively true. 

If some hyper-intelligent aliens visited us and came with some scanner that could view any human’s neurological activity in real time, they would observe objectively that the neuro-electric “energy in motion” moving throughout human bodies is what literally leads us to our beliefs, choices, lifestyles; everything. 

This is also why in controlling people, manipulating emotions is the name of the game. From the perspective of any successful manipulator, you don’t want to encourage anyone to think too critically if you benefit from them feeling emotionally compelled to do something that benefits you.

What I’m calling “emotion” is of course mediated by various complex interactions within the brain & the rest of the nervous system, involving neurotransmitters and electrical currents. They are also highly influenced by mind activity — the things we hold to be true within our subconscious minds. But they ultimately manifest as qualia, as visceral body experiences that we conscious beings actually sense and *feel*. And that energetic movement that our consciousness can sense in these bodies, is what mobilizes us through our lives. It is objectively real as a mobilizing force in our human consciousness. 

So by making us *feel* something via painting some sort of picture in our minds (for example how companies use advertisements to imprint the picture that their product = happiness, onto peoples subconscious minds) powerful people can control our behavior. 

This is both scary and liberating depending on how you look at it. It is clear that the media and corporations and governments have many people on earth under their various emotional spells. This is the scary part, since many of those sources do not send out the best messages. 

But the liberating part is that, “powerful people”, to some real underrated degree, actually includes us. Our own selves. If we make the choice to, going forward, take on primary responsibility for further influence on our own minds, and for how we influence our own nervous systems to feel+respond to our world, it means we can make the emotional patterns that fuel us, into ones of more optimum wellbeing, fulfillment, and joy. 

There being no fixed determined meanings other than the ones we humans co-create via the ways we condition eachother’s nervous systems, means a vast range of freedom in possible experienced realities. When we tap into *our own minds* (as well as the minds of those who genuinely inspire us to feel deeper and better), and re-route what psycho-emotional maps our bodies follow and think by, the lives we live as conscious beings could likely become ones of supreme beauty.

Due to this realization and not really perhaps being old or wise enough to understand my feelings I ended up getting involved in drugs and crime without any regard for my health, wellbeing or anyone else's feelings. I acted completely amoral and I didn't really care about anything or how that affected anyone. It wasn't until I made a mistake so huge that my life completely changed, I was now a felon and i had shamed myself and my families name (we live in a small town in NZ). Somehow I had gone from realizing god wasn't around and that life is just what it is to not caring about people at all and throwing everything away. 

Im unsure if it was because I had a conscience that I had buried down that when I had done this I completely broke down into an emotional, nervous wreck. I honestly can't tell you if its because I feel bad or because I'd ruined my family name, my reputation and future opportunities, and I dont think that really matters. Ive lived since then trying to turn my life completely around, being kind to all and working on myself and my anti social traits, sharing my positive mindset with others etc. It's been almost 7 years since my big ""mistake"" (it was a heavily publicized theft with no name supression, to be more clear).

1700073936.0,"A futuristic spaceship-body: If you radically alter the environment, selves will radically alter. Your self is only an accident of your contingent environment. Everything about your self could have been radically different.","(TLDR) No, a half-mile wide human embedded and controlled spaceship-body is not an abomination to nature, to humans, or to our selves. We did not create some monster. There are no monsters. Our selves are creations of our social world. If we radically alter our social world, we radically our selves. Evolution and DNA does not create some standard human self or human environment.

**A Different Self**

We can imagine 2000 years in the future the following procedure: A fetus is developed rather normally. We have standard DNA/epigenetic structure, perhaps slight cognitive enhancement, but still very much human.

Then, at birth, we prepare the baby to *become* a half-mile wide, star hopping space ship. We remove all limbs and plug peripheral nerves into ship sensors and into thrusters and flaps. We carefully remove the eyes and ears and plug those sensory systems into new “eyes.” These can be sensory systems that see a great range of the electromagnetic spectrum. We plug other visual nerves into instrument converters that feed the brain with other information, about radiation for example.

Our newborn human, our slightly enhanced brain, is now learning to govern the motion and sensory systems of the ship. Where brains once navigated through the human body, they now govern a ship-body. For the most part, we can still imagine this brain as running through many of the thought processes of us today, including of the representations that it has of its self. We can allow it to still run on emotions, if we want. We could still have desires, fear, and doubt. We could still have many of the characteristics that we see in us today. (Don't ask about sex.)

These kinds of thoughts remind us of several things. There is not some endpoint to evolution that was “human.” There is not an endpoint that looks like our selves today, living in a ""normal"" environment and body. The above story is not an abomination to humans, because nature cares nothing for this false essentializing of the “human"" or of the environment.

All evolution did was end up with a DNA structure like the one that sits inside our cells. Importantly, nature was not trying to create a “human” that lives in a standard earth and pack-societal environment. Our DNA may have developed within such processes, but there was not some desire of evolution that humans/DNA remain within that environment.

Furthermore, there is not some genuine self sitting within our DNA just waiting to emerge into existence. Pretty much any kind of characteristic that we have today can be grossly changed given a radically different environment. Many of those characteristics can be radically changed through normal social environmental changes that we are capable of today. Even today we can radically change the characteristics of our sexuality, our introversion/extroversion, our gender, our knowledge attainment, and so on. We can of course also edit DNA pre- and post-birth, as well as other chemical and brain alterations.

A cheap shot, but you should hit over the head anyone talking about expression of their true self. We can give better descriptions of our selves than that. There are interesting tales to tell about how our DNA becomes what we are. Our selves are products of a contingent social environment. One that we as society choose. Your self is determined by your parents and community. That could have been done completely differently. We can build radically different selves for the next line of selves, if we choose.

Stories about why we are the way we are will require a rich combination of genes and environment. When we de-essentialize the human condition, when we de-essentialize our selves, we can begin to tell the interesting stories about why we are the way we are. We can only do that by seeing the openness of the social and environmental world.

Not so long ago, I finally realized that I'm a theoretical nihilist (the existential kind, not the moral one). But I'm a 100% practical absurdist. 

I think like an existential nihilist. But I act like an absurdist. Live out of spite, seek joy and not meaning (since there's none to be found anyways, on which we all agree here). 

My whole life is a rebellion against the meaninglessness. But I cannot **think** like an absurdist to save my life.

When you try to imagine what is ""nothingness"", your brain has started to imagine SOMETHING. So to ""grasp"" nothingness, you just have to stop thinking, stop imagining, stop seeing, stop smelling... That is nothingness.

And the brain HATE neutrality. It is either good or bad for our brain. Neutrality is like the absence of a tag for an event... Our brain loves to put the tag ""good"" or ""bad"" on thing, it is in our nature. It's why depressed use nihilism as the absence of meaning as their reason to be depressed actually they are not about the lack of meaning, they are just sad BECAUSE they lack dopamine in their brain.

Philosophy is really trying to be too complex for this world which is actually so damn simple.

Nothingness = neither good neither bad.

Our brain loves to think that it is nothingness at death because we naturally avoid negatives events (only a real insane person in an asylum would not), so the brain understand nothingness as ""no bad"" and he loves that.

I don't think we're really here for any higher purpose or goal but rather simply a byproduct of atoms mashing together creating life. Here's the thing however, with our current understanding there are potentially dozens of atoms which can't be formed naturally by our space time. Materials not found in nature like plutonium. They are in a sense, aritificial. 

Perhaps the whole point of our existence is to just contribute to the needs of the universe, in essence we are a planet in our own sense. We're a black hole in a different way.

1698468564.0,Congratulations you are an atheist. Now shed the rest of your empty cultural baggage.,"Congratulations you are an atheist. 

Now discard other discordant beliefs. Hold your self at arm's length. 

One of the best arguments against religion is the fact that most people believe their parents' beliefs. An iranian is muslim. A roman is catholic or polytheistic. A german is protestant. Even your basic belief about god is only there because of your background. 

Belief in god and your particular religion is wrong because it is not grounded in empiricism. It is merely grounded in word of mouth. Your parents' beliefs came from their parents' beliefs. 

The reason why this argument is so devastating is because when you on reflect religious belief, all you can do is ground it in the folk tales told by people. The places where religion tries to attach itself to reality is a shambles. Laughable. Which means, all there is, is word of mouth and nonsense abstract notions pulled out of thin air.

I am asking you today to set aside all beliefs of your parents and culture. And not just the foolish. But all of it. See your parents' world. See your world. See your self as a product of that world. See your created self as a non-critical product of that world. All sorts of judgments, structures, identities, and behavior flows through your self. You, your self, your brain/mind, was slowly created by a world you could not see while you were being programmed by it. You were programmed for more than a decade in your parents' world. There are endless cultural structures to that world that are as empty as religion. Some of those will be small and benign cultural artefacts. Some of that programming may even flow from empirical knowledge, which is fine to keep hold of. 

But the vast majority of who you are is empty cultural baggage. As empty as that religious baggage that you so readily shed. Why you have rubber-stamped all the other cultural baggage I do not know. Now, of course you do not really have a choice. Some of this stuff is just part and parcel of you, of your self. A lot of it, though, are things that you can stop taking seriously. Just like you have stopped taking your cultural religion seriously.

My argument here. Is that it is not just religion you should shed. But a great deal of your self, beliefs, behaviors, and identity.

   
You should do this not because all of these things are as wrong as religion. Some of them are just benign culture. The bigger problem is that they weave there way into the programming of your brain/mind in a way that you cannot even see. We need to see our cultural world, so we can evaluate it and change it. We need to see the structures of our self, of our psychology, so that we can evaluate it and change it. If we choose to change it (free will does not exist).  ",0

One of religion's main roles is to suppress the feminine principle, which is why religions like Christianity and Islam tend to not have a very high opinion of women.

1698267433.0,A bit of hope.,"
In the past, I made a post where I claimed that life is ultimately meaningless and that nothing we do really matters. I was trapped in a nihilistic mindset, feeling lost and empty. But something changed along the way.

I started to realize that even if the universe itself is indifferent towards our existence, our own subjective experiences can still hold value and meaning. I started to cherish the connections I have with others, the beauty of nature, the power of creativity and the pursuit of knowledge.

I also faced and overcame some personal challenges that made me appreciate the fragility and preciousness of life itself. I choose to embrace the uncertainty of the future, to make the most of what I have today, and to strive for something greater.

In short, I'm no longer a pessimistic nihilist who thinks that nothing matters. I'm now a hopeful and curious human who sees purpose and potential in the world. I'm still learning and growing, but I'm no longer stuck in a bleak worldview that only brings despair.

After spending some time on the subreddit, I realized that it was not doing me any good. While it's understandable to explore and even embrace nihilistic ideas, I found that the community was often too fixated on the negative aspects of existence, on the futility of trying, and on the dismissal of any values or morality. It was draining my energy and creativity, and making me feel more isolated and hopeless than ever before.

Therefore, I decided to leave the subreddit for good. I hope that those who remain there find some solace, joy, or intellectual stimulation from engaging with nihilism or other philosophical positions. I won't judge them for their beliefs or their emotions, as we all have our own ways of dealing with the complexities of life.

However, I also hope that they can move beyond the limitations of nihilism and find other perspectives that can still be truthful, nuanced, and empowering. Perhaps they can explore existentialism, humanism, spirituality, or other frameworks that acknowledge the challenges of existence while also celebrating the possibilities of growth, love, and creativity.

As for me, I'm still struggling with my own existential questions and anxieties, but I'm no longer despairing or passive about them. I'm seeking out positivity, connection, and purpose wherever I can, and I'm grateful for the supportive communities that help me do so. I wish you all well on your own journeys, wherever they may lead you.",0

I don’t mean it in a depressing way, but ever since I started thinking critically for myself and looking at life from as objective of a point of view as I can have, I am so aware of my existence that I feel like I’m constantly anticipating my death.

It doesnt help either that as I get older it feels like time is going by faster, which just makes me feel like I’m getting closer and closer to death.

I am a overall happy person but I’ve noticed lately I’m so consumed by my death its distracting me from being able to really enjoy my time. 

It feels like I’m waiting to die, like I know it’s coming, and time is moving fast. It’s inevitable and there’s nothing I can do.

I feel like im  going to feel this way until I die. 

Like how can I “unsee” the truth? Like I grew up lying to myself about life (religion, afterlife) and once I was able to face reality for what it is it’s like I can’t not know that I’m finite.

That doesn’t change the fact that I still feel like I am waiting to die. I don’t even know if that’s the best way to describe the feeling, I guess I would say I feel like death is around every corner, and I’m just hyper aware of that fact constantly.

1698083578.0,Exstistential Dread,"Hey guys. This is like my third post related to this.. But I never get any replies, so here goes another try.. When I was a kid, I was raised as a Christian. So, although I didn't understand death yet, I knew that one day I would be able to spend eternity on my own slice of heaven with my passed loved ones. I didn't understand the idea of death, but I knew that my grandparents and parents are going to die one day, and I hated it. I didn't want them to leave me behind. When I was a kid, I remember watching movies like the lion king and the land before time, where the protagonist child's parent dies. After each of those movies I would walk up to my mom bawling my eyes out telling her that I don't want her to die and leave me here without her. She would always reassure me that her death isn't something that I would have to worry about for quite a long time, then she would distract me with some bs to help me forget about it. Then I would also remind myself that I will one day die too and see them in heaven. So that made me feel a little better. And, besides seeing my loved ones in heaven, I couldn't wait to get to heaven because the only thing that really interested me at the time was the universe, and everything in it. I had so many questions that I wanted to ask god. Anyway, throughout time I forgot about Christianity and death in general, because I was that naive young teen who felt immortal. Like death would NEVER happen to me. As I became an older teen I started to acknowledge death, but at this time I wasn't really sure if I still believed in God. But I still felt like death was still not something I had to worry about.. Anyway, it wasn't until I turned 27 that my mortality really slapped me across the face.. ""You are going to die one day, and there's probably no heaven or God and you will never see your past loved ones again.."" it made me nearly collapse on the spot. I never really imagined the possibility of there being just NOTHING after death. I always imagined a heaven or some spiritual realm. But nothing? Forever? I just couldn't fathom it. It is my biggest fear.. Then I realized that I had another fear.. Aging. I really don't want to die old guys.. For a couple of reasons.. 1) Throughout my life I've suffered from clinical depression and anxiety and physical problems like the prostate of an old man.. Which makes my sex life nearly non existent. So this life, so far, has been a nightmare. And I imagine it's just going to get worse with age. And 2) I am just expected to GO ON after the people who raises you are just GONE FOREVER!? I'd rather just die with them than continue on to die without them there to comfort me. And 3) I hate humanity. I always have. I hate human society, the needless wars we start, the way we applaud companies like Apple, nike, samsung, etc. Yet we know that their products are being made by SLAVES in sweatshops that are surrounded by suicide nets to stop the slaves from trying to jump to their deaths rather than continue their lives in slavery. And we are knowingly destroying our ONLY livable planet. And we are all floating on a rock in infinite space and what we have dedicated our whole lives to is.. Working.. 8-12 hours a day so we can make.. Paper.. Paper that we gave value to.. Just to grow old and hopefully able to retire and then just.. die and.. cease to exist..? I mean there is a whole universe out there to be explored and we instead to spend our lives over useless things like politics where we are never on the same page, money, who has the nicest car, or biggest house, etc. It all seems pointless to me. So I was hoping to die and realize that I'm not JUST a human, but actually a spiritual being that transcends this useless human body. So with all of that being said, I have considered suicide.. I know I SHOULDNT want to die by my own hand.. But now that I believe that after this life there's just.. Nothing.. I no longer want to be here. Everything feels so pointless to me now.. Does anybody feel like this, or am I the only one..? I just want some opinions
 That's all. Thanks guys",0

My understanding of nihilism is that it is just as the Latin translation states ""nothing"". Logic says that there has to be ""something"" for there to be ""nothing"" but that seems more like an assumption due to our dualistic pattern-seeking brains. 

""nothing"" seems like such an abstract concept that we can't help but polarize it with there being a ""thing"". I think that intrapersonal subjectivity is how we assign nihilism as either good or bad like the concept of optimistic nihilism. I have never heard of the concept of pessimistic nihilism which makes me assume that nihilism is viewed as pessimistic to begin with. 

Do you think of nihilism as good, bad, neither, or both? Is nihilism a non-dualistic concept to you?

1697991228.0,A few thoughts about Nihilism,"Since a long time, I'm intrigued by nihilistic ideas, and after some thinking about it, I wanted to share a few thoughts about Nihilism :

It's clear that all things don't have inherent meaning, and one of the main reasons why people try to find meaning to all things is that we are programmed to try to find meaning in things, and the satisfaction of this ""need"" is considered to be vital for most humans, and it's probably why some people became delusional when they don't find any meaning.

One tactic to overcome this risk is to simply try to do something interesting, and since nothing has meaning, there's no occupation that is more or less valuable than another, so we can do whatever we want. 

Some folks on this sub don't seem to care about doing something (because nothing has meaning), but all the means to occupy ourselves until we die are equivalent, so there no reason to do nothing instead of doing something (and vice-versa). 


All a bunch of words just to say that we can do some things even if we know that there finally no meaning, and the pursuing of some goals, and the act of do something we enjoy, all these things aren't incompatible with Nihilism...

All this seems to point a way leading to Absurdism, which is an interesting philosophy, that have the advantages to be based on Nihilism, and to not look for any meaning in anything.

1697670103.0,Nihilism = Freedom,"The problem with Existentialism is that once meaning has been built, that meaning often becomes ossified and loses any malleability; it essentially becomes dogma, a set of Laws.

Nihilism recognizes that meaning is never solid, it is always malleable and just a game -- like a sandcastle that shifts in the wind depending on the tides.

Some claim this makes Nihilism useless, no place to rest your head. They seek something more solid on which to build values, ethics, etc.

Have fun with that project, but I believe it is futile like seeking the true Religion. There simply is no solid ground upon which to establish meaning. 

But that doesn't mean that meaning can't exist for a Nihilist -- it just means we recognize and remember that the meaning we have constructed is a plaything, a toy, nothing to be taken too seriously, and that it can be easily discarded if something more interesting comes along.",0

Yet I find myself very aggravated, sometimes visibly crying/angry at the state of our world.


If you’re keeping up with news you will see what’s happening in the Middle East (Israel/Palestine) and just so so many innocent people, children (this is what hurts the most) are dying on both sides.

Then even when there isn’t war children are being molested, raped, murdered.

Adults suffer the same fate. 

And if you’re lucky. You’re actually not. Since everyone just works and works to afford to exist in this capitalistic hellhole we call earth. 

Everyone probably suffers some sort of mental illness to varying degrees.

The world just feels like hell.???? 

As a nihilist I shouldn’t care?? Should I? I feel like I should accept it is what it is and my emotions do not matter for shit. Kids getting blown up and me feeling sad about it should matter equally as fucking little right? 

But to me… apparently, there’s a difference. I still feel sad. I feel like something is wrong. My question is why do I still feel absurd emotions?

It’s like my brain accepts nihilism but my heart does not??

Why am I crying so many meaningless tears as a nihilist?

My god, I wish I never existed.

But I can’t wrap my head around why I feel this way. Why can’t I just be apathetic to everything?

What’s the point of nihilism if I care about suffering that doesn’t matter to any living being in 100 years time????

It’s starting to make more sense to just become some anti nihilist and try and fix the world. Any means necessary. To stop the suffering.

1697605419.0,Nihilism is Freedom,"Nihilism is freedom due to its rejection of traditional value systems, moral absolutes, and the idea of there needing to be an inherent purpose.

Freedom from External Constraints: Nihilism rejects the notion of inherent meaning or external authority dictation how you should live your life. It frees us from the constraints of societal expectations, religious doctrines, and moral codes set by others.

Freedom to Define Values: Meaning is ultimately subjective and what you create for yourself (if at all). You have the freedom to define your own values and principles based on your own experience and desires. Explore and experiment without feeling confined by external dogma.

Freedom from Guilt and Shame: There is no higher moral standard. There are no moral truths. There is no objective basis for guilt or shame. Be liberated. 

Freedom to Pursue Authenticity: Explore your authentic self and desires. There are no predefined purposes or expectations. Seek out what truly resonates with you (if anything).

Freedom from Existential Angst: Life is meaningless so there is no reason to try searching for meaning or feeling there must be more meaning. There need not be a reason for why you exist. There are ultimately no answers to life’s big questions that society would have you believe need answering. Be released from the anxiety and pressure to find answers.

Intellectual Freedom: Nihilism promotes intellectual freedom by encouraging critical thinking and skepticism. Question established truths with inquiry and exploration.

1697584159.0,Nihilistic thinking is trauma,"Could it be true that many who find themselves to be nihilistic in their thinking are doing so because of difficulties in the past like trauma? 

I’ve been really fascinated with Alfred Adler, psychoanalyst that worked with Freud, (until he fired him) who came up with individual psychology. Here’s a little bit on (what I feel) highlights an important component..

Alfred Adler believed that psychological developments occur only when individuals have personal goals. According to Adler, human behavior is driven by the pursuit of goals and the desire for personal fulfillment.

Adler argued that individuals are motivated by their unique subjective experiences and perceptions of the world. He believed that people strive for superiority, which he defined as a desire to overcome feelings of inferiority and to strive for personal excellence. This striving for superiority is what leads individuals to set personal goals and work towards achieving them.

Adler emphasized the importance of understanding an individual's subjective experience and their unique goals in order to comprehend their behavior and psychological development. He believed that individuals develop their own unique lifestyle, which is shaped by their goals, beliefs, and values. This lifestyle influences their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

According to Adler, psychological development occurs when individuals set and pursue meaningful goals that align with their values and aspirations. These goals provide individuals with a sense of purpose and direction in life. As individuals work towards their goals, they develop skills, overcome challenges, and gain a sense of competence and self-confidence.

In Adler's view, psychological problems arise when individuals face obstacles or setbacks in pursuing their goals. These challenges can lead to feelings of inferiority, discouragement, and a loss of motivation. Adler believed that therapy should focus on helping individuals identify and pursue meaningful goals, as well as develop strategies to overcome obstacles and enhance their sense of self-worth.

Overall, Adler's statement suggests that personal goals play a crucial role in psychological development. By setting and pursuing meaningful goals, individuals can experience personal growth, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose in their lives.

This makes me think of one of my favorite Nietzche quotes: 
He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.

To tie this is with trauma/abuse, - I read Janina Fishers book this year on trauma and it was fascinating. I feel it really helped me to see people’s behaviors differently. I believe that so many have nervous systems that are disregulated and “stuck” in the past, dissociating, numbing and that makes goal setting difficult. Ifs difficult to focus on a why or even a how when we are stuck in fight or flight mode.

I’m not saying it’s all bad, just that I see it. I was just talking with someone earlier whose struggled with addiction all of his life and he told me he’s a nihilist. I’ve been clean for over a year and still struggle, but am working hard towards becoming more goal oriented. It’s extremely hard growing up in a home that never encouraged, sexual and physical violence, confusing and strange. It has long lasting impacts and would make anyone feel nihilistic.

1697509761.0,Transcendental Nihilism,"Just came here to ask about this, I've seen a lot about this topic but no actual explanation and any explanation I have been able to find is incredibly vague. 

In my opinion, what the term refers to is the idea of nihilism at the end of time. Everything will die with no meaning and no point, us, animals, the grass that is pulled from the ground, and even cells as they undergo mitosis. Every star, every galaxy, every atom, and so on, everything will die and as the universe comes to an end, what remains of any concept or idea will be the last to go with it. This is transcendental nihilism in my understanding. It is nihilism completely pushed to its utmost conclusion before the universe eventually ends and nihilism itself goes with it.

1697399179.0,"fatigued by ""finding meaning through..."" whatever it is type of stuff","i posted this hours ago as a comment in a post on r/Existentialism (tho the second paragraph i just added here):

the inherent struggle perceived within the tapestry of reality is, in essence, devoid of inherent meaning; it is merely a subjective interpretation. I observe a common tendency in individuals to elevate their pursuit of ""personal growth"" or the quest to find a meaningful purpose as transcendent and sacred. This sentiment, however, often stems from a realization that their endeavors contribute positively to the societal fabric. This contribution, in turn, fosters an elevation in self-esteem and a sense of personal value. In contrast, those trapped in a perpetual state of chaos, resembling the metaphorical ""child man,"" often grapple with a lack of meaningful contribution to their societal milieu. This pattern is deeply rooted in our collective unconscious, serving as an evolutionary tool for survival through cooperation, value addition, and altruism with the hope of reciprocal assistance when needed 

&#x200B;

and i find myself fatigued by individuals who incessantly seek meaning through various avenues, projecting their solitary odyssey through existence with such declarations. It echoes the sentiment reminiscent of narcissistic religious adherents who attribute their suffering to a divine love and a concealed plan underlying the seemingly malevolent nature of reality. It's worth noting that this perceived malevolence is merely a subjective construct crafted by the conscious entity's interpretation of reality. ",0

if our universe slams back in on itself to create a new proto universe (previously the only reason for any hope that anything will ever continue) it will probably slam down into perfect balance.

so chances are, after this universe dies, nothing will exist, ever again.

and before you say 'that is what makes us special / gives meaning' it doesn't, it is what prevents us from having a meaning.

if the universe were to reincarnate, there there would have been a slim chance that it would have borne intelligent enough life.

1696989891.0,"Our World. Our Selves. Our social world determines our self. We can build any social world we want. At least, for the next line of selves.","The issue here is that we define complex behavioral traits by how they manifest in us as adults. Most of these traits are complex traits that we experience. They run through our brain/minds. That is, there is imagery, emotion, feeling, and even linguistic description that we give to them. We end up with a disjunction between societal definitions and what is actually being created by genetic material. It is a large disjunction. The analyzing of human behavioral traits from genetic material has been hopelessly flawed. At least, as the program has so far been laid out.

([A YouTube video](https://youtu.be/pSF1MPJS2qU?si=b4Y-6SyVM_LV2SEk)(7 min) where I say the same thing as below.)

Sexuality, gender, and pretty much everything about our selves is capable of being done completely differently. This is made abundantly clear with a simple thought experiment. If your DNA was put into a single sex society, that had no knowledge, no concept, and no imagery of the other sex, including in animals, what sexuality would you be? What gender would you be?

Your genes are cheap. We can build different selves out of our same DNA that would be radically different, robust selves. To do so, we would have to build radically different social worlds. We have to accept, as reflective beings, that we can build radically different social worlds. We are very slowly socialized into our environment. We very slowly become complex selves, full of all the thoughts and imagery that flow through us.

Let's say our sexuality was completely determined by pheromones. For all of human history, we just live our lives in particular societies and allow beliefs and definitions of sexuality to arise. We, our selves, do not desire pheromones. We desire bodies, behaviors, appearances, whatever you desire in people. That is, when we experience our sexuality, it is a complex mental and emotional phenomena. So, we figure out that the entirety of our sexuality is this complex mental phenomena laid atop pheromones. Scientists isolate these pheromones. They spray the pheromone on a hamster and people start having emotional feelings towards hamsters. That may be something you would have to do in an early age before a person attaches sexual emotions and imagery to humans. If the pheromone story was the case, and discovered, and we did this a hundred years ago, many of the discussions about identity and behavior would have been different. We would have been more willing to destabilize the structure of our selves and world. I think many people would be more willing to hold their self at arm's length. They would see the accidentality of how genes and non-reflective parents/society allowed for a non-critical world to be set up around their DNA. They would see more of the story of why they are what they are.

Though our actual biology is more complicated than the pheromone story, this is essentially what is wrong with putting many of our behavioral traits into genetic schemata. Our genes do not lead to the kind of social world and selves that we see, unless you want to argue some long term deterministic, dialectic buildup across history. We are reflective beings. We can create any social world we want. At least as a species or community. The study of heritability, twin studies, and evolutionary psychology have constantly hit their head against such a problem. The problem is not in evolutionary and genetic paradigms. The problem is in overstating and solidifying psychology and behavioral traits that have immensely complex components. Language allows for self-reflection and self-blossoming in fabulous ways. The programming of our brains by genes/environment is wonderfully complex.

Let me give another thought experiment. We are travelling on a spaceship in the future. The idea is that we have created a single sex society and environment (And make no mistake, though a thought experiment, we could do the fundamentals of this today). Let's go all males. This ship has an AI program and artificial womb technology that has stored millions of fertilized eggs (or we just finagle cells). These males are raised to be knowledgeable but we deny them knowledge of females, across all life forms. That is, they have no imagery of female bodies or the concept of female altogether. Let's say they have the same spread of male genetics as society today. What sexuality are these males? I am telling you, right now, they are not desiring female bodies. Evolution did not program brains that have imagery of female bodies. Evolution did not need to do that. Whatever genes do to create sexual desire, it is worlds away from societal definitions and personal experiences.

It is not good enough in this day and age to say that a trait is a combination of genes and environment. Behavior and identity traits are fundamental to our selves. If we are not telling a good story about how they arise, then we are failing to tell a baseline story about why we are the way we are. This also means that we have trouble analyzing our contingent social world. Taking these traits as part and parcel of our selves has created a givenness to our characteristics. On an individual level, as we probe our own thoughts, it makes sense that we experience these things as they are given. Academically, and for purposes of self discovery, we need to tell better stories. As reflective beings, we need to remind people that we can build any self and any world (within reason) that we want.

Just to sidestep this, I fully support LGBTQ rights. That does not mean we retreat into our selves and into our world. Given the difficulties of unraveling our programming by genes and environment, I argue that we should, generally, put knowledge attainment before reproduction of self and society.

Alot of people hope that theyll do something that PEOPLE a thousand years from now will remember them for. Not the rock thats been there a thousand years before them and will be there for thousands of more years. At the very least you're important to yourself because youre a living being that prioritizes things like every other creature.

I believe this projection of life on the universe is an artifact of humanities history of believing in God(s). In the past being important to God was important. Pleasing God was important but more and more people are realizing that the evidence of a God is insufficient. Yet our culture and the mindsets it promotes still havent broken away from the deeper concepts of God/projection.

If you dont believe me compare these two questions:
Am I significant to the universe?
Am I significant to God?

Now consider that the answer is you are not significant to God. How does that make you feel? You are not significant to the universe. How does that make you feel? They probably make you feel the same. Youll probably ask yourself if im not significant than why am I here? As if God/the universe conciously assigns roles to everything to achieve some grand mission.

I believe that absurdism and nihilism can be good stepping stones out of this conceptual projection but they can also be traps if you fail to see the flaws within the question ""Are we significant to the universe?""

Does anyone know of a philosophy beyond projection? If you have some suggestions plz lmk.

TLDR: The question ""Are we significant to the universe?"" is a projection of life on the universe that comes from humanity's historic beliefs in God(s). The only things that understand the value of importance are living beings. At the very least you are important to yourself.",0

1696844501.0,Maybe the source of my agony is the feeling that I am 'owed' one.,"This might not be directly related to nihilism but my question is rooted from conversations I had in this sub. 


**Question** :


**IF** I  believe that karma, God, or super power does not exist, then why do I have this feeling that after all my struggles, something good must happen to me?


**Why**:

All my life I have struggled, suffered and worked hard to become something bigger than I could. And I achieved many things. 


Along all of that, every single person that came in my life, I went out of my way to support them and make them who they never were  - by being there for them for years and years and even more so financially. Never expected even a tiny bit. Help them become independent. Had everyone's best interest. Just did things thinking that my purpose is to help my fellow humans. Forgave them. Nurture them. Selflessly care. 

Edit: I did earn some of these people for life. They care about me and are with me (in their own capacity).

**Lows** :

Today, through no fault of my own, I am at the lowest lows. I saw the worst in last 3 years. When the time came to bear the fruits, I think I lost it all. And I can't help but wonder why.


**Positive steps**:

In last 3 years, I have been trying hard to see it positively. I worked out more and more. Tried to take positive steps for my life. Stayed fully sober for 6 months in the lowest periods.


 I wrote and published an entire music album and told my story - just to make the best out of this bad situation. Tried to stay as optimistic as I can. But I can't help but feel the dread. It's exhausting. It's suffocating here. It does not make sense. 


Am I wrong to feel that it's a bit unfair..or like a victim?


**Hypothesis**:

My hypothesis is that I was raised in a religious environment, maybe that's why subconsciously I still believe that something good **must** happen now?


Maybe I have been trained to believe that if I go through the lows, one day, there is a hope in the end? Something positive will happen? 


Or that good things happen to good people. 


The ""negative"" characters in my story have it all good. And when I am not seeing that good in my life, I am feeling 'nothing matters'. Why do it again? Why do any of this? 


**Could you share any insights? Any personal stories?**


I am going to see a therapist too but I want to work on this out of curiosity.


*(I call myself an atheist , but this whole post sounds like ""why God why, I was your true servant"" lol)*


EDIT: My point is not that I was taken advantage of people. I am glad I did what I did. But I feel, I was also a good kind person - morally, ethically etc., have been action oriented (as far as I can tell): and THIS is how low I have to be??",0

So, to start off, I already struggle with depression and anxiety so life already often feels tiring and pointless but that’s not the extent to my feelings.

Mundane tasks feel meaningless and everytime I have to get up and go to school or go to work, I question what’s even the point to it if we all die anyway. Despite knowing this fact, I do fear death and I do want to have a “purpose” in life but as far as I’m concerned, no one does. I often tell myself that it won’t matter because one day, the sun will explode and kill us all. So even if we document human history, contribute to society, it could be wiped away in the blink of an eye. Due to this, life feels repetitive and holds little value to me. 

I grew up Catholic but I don’t believe in it. If god truly existed then why does his actions contradict what people say about him? He’s all-knowing, loves all humans yet will send you to hell if you disobey him. It’s stupid and I can’t understand why anyone would willingly believe in something so blatantly fake.

1696542813.0,Tips and tricks,"As a recovering nihilist I feel the need to shed some light on my experience with it.
I can’t speak for all nihilists but I think I have a good grasp of it and it’s effects.

For me nihilism in a nut shell is simply not giving a shit. Not giving a shit has obvious pros but very sneaky cons. The more you drink the koolaid you may start feeling better because of the lack of stress that is no longer negatively effecting you. Now the tricky thing is people can often confuse the lack of stress as “happiness” and that is far from the truth.

The lack of stress is simply boredom, and too much of boredom is obviously not good for you and can eventually lead to being unfulfilled and eventually, stressed out.

Now as nihilisms effects on happiness…yea sorry but it works both ways. If you are indeed taking big gulps of the koolaid then be prepared to stop feeling as much happiness as you used to. 

Hobbies that you really enjoyed will become less and less enjoyable to the point where you will eventually have no desire to to partake in them, which leads to boredom…see the trend here?

A nihilist, who claims to only have happiness or only have suffering, in my opinion, is not a true nihilist.

If your trying to use nihilism to escape suffering then I’m sorry it’s just not going to work out the way you want it too. Our brains are cleverly designed and have evolved to strike a balance between suffering and happiness. You can’t fight your own biology and win. If you are needlessly suffering for whatever reason, your brain will eventually throw you a cookie even if you didn’t work for it, just the same as a rich man that has everything will inevitably become chronically depressed. We are designed to earn fulfillment and from that fulfillment comes happiness. In order to be fulfilled, we have to suffer. 

It really took me a long time to understand that. When I was going through a bad marriage that crashed horribly I turned to nihilism to comfort me, and comfort me she did, but she also robbed me of my future happiness and it is a bitch to gain the will and keep the momentum of working towards goals that fulfill me when I have the black hole of nihilism trying to suck me back in.

Now the paradox is, you can absolutely believe nihilism to be true philosophically and not drink the nihilism koolaid. It’s not exactly being a true nihilist because your essentially not practicing it and that’s ok.

So be wary of nihilism, it is very powerful. I still hold it to be very much true but I know better than to walk the walk and I hope you understand that too.

Anxiety and depression. But I was a kid, so I didn't understand it, so I was just a mess. Anyway, I hated life. I grew up poor, with an alcoholic father, no friends, yada yada yada.

A place where I would be my true self. A self that didn't have these PROBLEMS that I have. And I just accepted it as true.

But when I turned 27 I got hit by a brick wall of reality.. It came out of nowhere. ""You're going to die one day. And there's no actual proof of god.."" I suddenly became terrified of death.

I also want to define faith in a non-christian way. Because I think bad experiences with the church have really poisoned a lot of people's understanding of what faith actually is.

Faith is just belief. Belief without facts. Belief with incomplete data or no data at all.

As limited as we are by two eyes, two ears, and a physical body, we can never have a complete data set about reality. 

This makes faith a necessity. Not just in the ""modern"" world but in any world.

I used to think of faith in a completely Christian, religious way. I had to have faith in Jesus. Or God. And that was why I lost faith, because those myths and that social structure lost meaning to me when the people who gave it to me turned out to be hypocrites.

Since then, I've realized that by losing that faith, I lost faith in a lot of other things. I threw out my faith in people. Threw out my faith in nature. Threw out my faith in myself. Threw out anything that looked like a nonscientific Belief. Until I had nothing left because it turns out even science is based on faith in scientists and great men half the time.

You can try to not have beliefs. You can try to reject all morality and meaning. But ultimantly, that leaves you lost. Especially if you reject faith in yourself. If you lose the belief you had as a child that you could go anywhere and do anything and figure it all out. Then you're stuck. You can get that back though. Kinda feels about as stupid as asking Jesus into your heart, but more directed at your wounded inner child.

The philosophers that coined and predicted the coming wave of nihilism predicted that this is how it would present itself and made volumes of texts to salvage philosophical meaning.

Nihilism is not liberating, its debilitating.

Nihilism is not a philosophical destination, its a morbid realisation.

Let me clarify;

If you found liberation in the realisation of your own nihilism you've experienced an ironic twist of fate. In exploring your nihilism and meaninglessness you found something inside you that dares to exist regardless of nihilism. You've found the source of your meaning and can no longer call yourself a nihilist. Your subjective meaning has come forth but you give credit to nihilism and meaninglessness.

Nihilism is not a place to rest your head if you plan to wake up in the morning. There are no living absolute nihilists you must work to evolve your thought process.

1696241129.0,My Nihilistic View,"Life is a journey of continuous discovery, but what are we truly discovering? Are we uncovering some deep, underlying truth or are we simply creating our own version of reality? Perhaps the answer is somewhere in between.

As humans, we have a natural inclination to seek answers to the big questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning of life? But what if there is no objective answer to these questions? What if our search for truth is merely a human construct, limited by our own perceptions and biases?

This is the essence of philosophical nihilism - the recognition that objective truth may not exist. It asks us to question whether our understanding of the world is simply a product of our upbringing, culture, and personal experiences, rather than any inherent truth.

But that doesn't mean that there is no value to be found in the philosophical search for truth. Even if we cannot uncover any objective, underlying reality, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is still a worthy endeavor. It helps us to expand our thinking and consider new possibilities.

In some ways, nihilism can be freeing. If there is no objective meaning or truth, then we are free to create our own meaning and find our own purpose in life. We are free from the burden of trying to conform to some preconceived notion of what our lives should be, and instead, can live according to our own values and desires.

The human experience is multifaceted and that there is no single, simple answer to the big questions. It asks us to keep asking questions, to continue seeking knowledge, and to create meaning from within ourselves.

We are all insignificant specks in the vast expanse of the universe, yet we are capable of experiencing intense emotions, creating art, and exploring the mysteries of the world. Our existence is a fleeting moment in the grand scheme of things, but it is all we have. ",0

1696183095.0,All knowledge is uncertain.,"the idea is this: the more information you are privy to, the more the probabilities of something happening changes. The more knowledge you discover, the more wrong the original calculation becomes.

For example: generally speaking, the chances of a flipped coin landing on heads 100 times in a row is 1 in 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376.

But what you didn’t know before doing the calculation was that the coin was weighted in a manner in which it always landed on its head. So, is that probability still relevant? No.

This is a very obvious example. Point is that, we don’t know every possible force that’s exerted on the coin. More we know, less accurate the original calculation becomes.

But how about less obvious ones? For example, what if instead of the coin being weighted, the reason why the coin landed on heads 100 times was because the wind just happened to blow at a certain speed and frequency, that aligned with the different throwing pattern of the coin all 100 times to give us this result? Is it still that same probability? No. These times it’s much lower, no?

Furthermore, why stop at just the wind? Why did the wind act in that manner? Because of air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place to another… why is that? And eventually, after taking everything in consideration, every particle and every possible influence on the coin, you’ll get the answer. And the answer in the example is 1. The probability of something that happened (in that same exact manner) in the past is always 1 in 1. And as for things that didn’t happen… it’s always 0 in 1.

I.e., calculating the true probability of something happening would require knowledge of everything… in which case the probability would either be 1 or 0. There is no 20% chance of something happening In objective reality. It’s either 1 or 0. And one can not know anything with any degree of certainty, without the complete set of all knowledge.

Under this premise… no claim can be said to be objectively true. Because you lack the complete set of all knowledge, you can not be completely certain regarding the truth of any claim.

No objective meaning… but it also means that you can’t deny anything. You can’t deny that they is objective meaning or that any claim of objective meaning isn’t true because you don’t have the necessary knowledge required to make that claim.

A perfect form of nihilism. You deny everything until you can’t deny anything at all. 

Under this premises, there’s also no freewill. Since it follow a a predeterministic idea.

Lastly: yes, there are patterns that the world follows… general statistics can apply to wide array of different people. You can find all sorts of patterns naturally generating in the universe. Patterns that you can realistically predict using statistics. 

But the existence of patterns doesn’t contradict my claim.",0

1696059413.0,Nihilistic Imperative,"My argument is as follows-
1. Let the probability of the statement ""Nihilism is true."" being true be P

2. Since there is no consensus now, and since nihilism is mostly about the absence of evidence, P<1 and P>0

3. True outcome is either P=1 or P=0

If true P=1, there is no point in doing anything anyway, even if this is wrong it doesn't matter.

If true P=0, my crucial point is that expectation of more future information decreases the expectation of future P, as new ideas take time to come about, as people(or even AI like Chatgpt) get more intelligent/knowledgeable.
Even if true P=0 or true P=1  is unknowable, we don't know that it's unknowable, so it doesn't matter.

EDIT: Why does expectation of more future information decrease the expectation of future P?
For a general argument, if true P=0, the chance of a false negative P=1 is zero, its a contradiction by definition. It follows that future information would either be irrelevant or prove that P=0, so future P either stays constant or is zero, expectation of future P is less than current P.

Therefore regardless if true P=0 or true P=1, nihilists should:
1. Survive into the future so that (2) can happen
2. Gather more information/increase our collective intelligence to get closer to ""truth""",0

1695996027.0,Nihilism is NOT apathy.,"It's time I address one of my biggest annoyances with a lot of posts/comments I see on this sub.

I'm sure frequent-browsers of this sub have seen it before (and if you have not, check out [this](https://reddit.com/r/nihilism/s/3AjKwDXWeI) linked post, or [this one,](https://reddit.com/r/nihilism/s/o8e9QE8iIK) which are both older but still salient examples) - someone claiming that nihilists, because they believe nothing matters, should not do anything and resign to apathy. After all, if nothing matters, why wouldn't we?

And, if you're anything like me, this line of reasoning has irritated you to no end! Nihilism is *not* apathy. It is not defined by apathy, and apathy is not an inevitable byproduct of it.

Nihilists can and do still care about things. New nihilists often worry that they can't, and come here to ask what to do, or even attempt to tell us off (see linked posts), and the answer is always the same. You can still care about things subjectively! Just recognize that your cares and values don't matter, even as you have them.

For example, I can care about a personal possession. Maybe it has high monetary value, or it carries some sentimental affection to me. In my mind, it feels as if it has value, or perhaps even meaning. Yet, as a nihilist, I also recognize that it doesn't, and the internal mental feeling that makes me believe it does is an *illusion.* Yet, to avoid a fate wherein we cease to do anything at all, we should *live the illusion anyways,* while *simultaneously* recognizing that it is in fact illusory, and does not matter. It may seem illogical from one perspective, but when you realize that it's the best way nihilists can avoid apathy, it becomes logical from another perspective.

Apathy would be the destruction of us all. Nietzsche saw how nihilism, when headed along a course of apathy, could be such a destructive force - and it's part of why he tried to steer the world away from this version of nihilism. Therefore, apathy must be avoided, which is why the refutation of ""Nihilists are apathetic"" is so absolutely paramount. 

Nihilism would also be incompatible with human nature if it sought to suppress all human urges, desires, and values. Luckily, it does not have to do that. 

We can care, assign (illusory) meaning, and live life, all while knowing of (and in spite of) none of it mattering. And that is what we must do, as humans, if we wish to truly live.",0

This feeling is higher to the surface for some and deeper for others.

But the reason which makes someone Optinistic Nihilist is Money and not Meaning.

In Holy Vedas, Hindu scriptures, Money is called ""Artha"" which is translated to ""Meaning"". According to same scriptures people who don't have money live meaningless lives. Other ""Arthas"" meanings are Kama (Pleasures like  sex, food) and Dharma (Duty to your society).

 The things is if you have money you automatically fulfill the others because you can have women and food and also Contribute to GDP of nation/society. Also out of the Others only Money is called by the name Artha, others are Purusharthas (Meanings of Masculinity). Since money is Artha I believe it's most important.

Religion maybe man made but sometimes they can explain different situations. For example, it is correct on its opinion on Money.

1695640223.0,The Power of 'Nothing' over Logic.,"

*""But are we allowed to tamper with the rule of “logic""? Isn't intellect the 
taskmaster in this question of the nothing? Only with its help can we at all define the 
nothing and pose it as a problem—which, it is true, only devours itself.... But if we do not let ourselves be misled by the formal impossibility of 
the question of the nothing; if we pose the question in spite of this; then we must at least 
satisfy what remains the basic demand for the possible advancing of every question.... For the last time now the objections of the intellect would call a halt 
to our search, whose legitimacy, however, can be demonstrated only on the basis of a 
fundamental experience of the nothing....No matter how fragmented our everyday existence may appear to be, 
however, it always deals with beings in a unity of the “whole,” if only in a shadowy way. 
Even and precisely then when we are not actually busy with things or ourselves this “as a 
whole” overcomes us—for example in genuine boredom....We “hover” in anxiety. More precisely, anxiety leaves us hanging because it 
induces the slipping away of beings as a whole....The nothing reveals itself in anxiety—...Holding itself out into the nothing, Dasein is in each case already beyond beings 
as a whole. This being beyond beings we call “transcendence.”...*

**In this way the above thesis in its main features has been proven: the nothing is 
the origin of negation, not vice versa. If the power of the intellect in the field of inquiry 
into the nothing and into Being is thus shattered, then the destiny of the reign of “logic” 
in philosophy is thereby decided. The idea of “logic” itself disintegrates in the turbulence 
of a more original questioning...  But the question of the nothing at the same time pervades the 
whole of metaphysics, since it forces us to face the problem of the origin of negation, that 
is, ultimately, to face up to the decision concerning the legitimacy of the rule of “logic” in 
metaphysics.""**

1695603924.0,"Nihilism isn’t logical or illogical, it simply is.","I see some debate online from time to time, some people trying to assert Nihilism as either logical or illogical, the absolute truth of the universe or a meaningless bunch of nonsense that doesn’t hold together. Now as the title of the post suggest, well, i think it’s just a belief, it simply makes sense within itself and trying to dismantle it from the inside so to speak is entirely pointless. So. Instead let me offer up a more meta point of view. I will be upfront, i have my respective issues and some criticism on how nihilism is treated as a whole, (both good and bad) so i thought that if anyone had any thoughts about that it would probably be you guys. Anyways.

&#x200B;

Let’s pick things up from the start. Nihilism, like all things, starts with a simple truth, or at the very least something that can be fiercely defended, you can’t create objectivity out of something that is at its core subjective (that something in this case being the general experience of everything, from the world to reality to society, morals, you name it.), of course you can try to make an approximation that can be good enough, that’s why we have ""common sense"", but it pales in comparaison to what would be a truly objective perspective.

This is the basis of skepticism, but in contrast to Nihilism, skepticism leaves things there, it makes no statement, because if you can’t know then the only thing that is truly wrong is being too certain of something, you don’t know what you don’t know, so don’t assume too much and don’t discard anything out of hand either.

This is pretty great, it’s open mindedness personified, problem is that it in itself does not make a worldview and as individuals we kinda need that, we need to make assumptions about how the world works in spite of knowing almost nothing of it in any individual capacity. 

In contrast, Nihilism makes an ultimate conclusion out of this, it’s simply that there is no conclusion to be found, there is no inherent meaning to life, existence, the universe or what have you.

There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s a belief, a belief like any other and i don’t have any bones to pick with it in itself, but what i think is a little problematic is that people don’t seem to quite acknowledge their beliefs for what they are, granted that is true of essentially all beliefs in general across the board, but i think it is sometimes especially prevalent surrounding the discoure around nihilism, in my experience the nihilistic outlook is oftentimes almost treated as a form of revelation or realization about the universe, when it really isn’t any different than the other beliefs out there (at least in my view). I think it would be interesting to look into *why* that seems to be the case and look at such sentiments with a more critical eye, regardless if someone believes in Nihilism or not.

&#x200B;

My second point i’d like to look into a little is this.

&#x200B;

For a lot of people Nihilism isn’t such a bad thing in fact it can be quite positive, it’s the ultimate freedom, the freedom to choose and create you own meaning, but that in itself makes nihilism the ultimate responsibility. That is the one and frankly also kinda massive ""problem"" with nihilism on a more meta and less personal perspective, this responsibility can be a burden for someone who struggles to find any meaning in their daily activities and life in general, couple to that the fact that the premise of nihilism is exactly something that someone who finds little meaning in their daily life will believe in and understand, not just on an intellectual level, but also on an affective one.

And that, that right there is the relation to Depression and Nihilism. Nihilism isn’t making people depressed no that’s nonsense, but depressed people will be attracted and subsequently struggle with nihilism because difficulty in finding any meaning for themselves is \*exactly\* what depression is about. It’s the unfortunate reality about this philosophy, and i think it’s true that in some instances, this philosophy will have a genuinely negative impact on at least some people’s lives. The saddest part about that is that despite ourselves we largely can’t help what we believe in, what conclusions we arrive to, the only thing we can do is take a step back and consider the other options, but again, as humans we’ve never been good at doing that.

&#x200B;

So yeah, to make things short, the beginning and end of my point is in itself nothing really spectacular or unexpected or mind boggling, but it’s something incredibly important to remember regardless as it kind of is the beginning and the end of philosophy as a whole. ""All that we really know, is that we know nothing."" that saying in itself is something that we inevitably stray from to create worldviews, but i think it’s something we should never let out of our sight, it’s an anchor, the only thing that ever was that can be assumed to be true.",0

1695619362.0,"Nihilistic rumination seems to come from an inconclusive attitude, or just a resent for ambiguity.","Like, if you're a nihilist who *has* to think themselves into a nihilistic corner...because ""truth"" or whatever then you're kidding yourself about the origins of your beliefs. As a nihilist myself, you know how many times I consciously think about nihilism? Probably once or twice a year in response to some piece of literature or a film, or art. 

Other than that I live my life according to my own understanding of things. This is also my issue with the depressive/optimistic dichotomy in nihilistic thought. If you're focused on your lived experience, on your life in the world dealing with and responding to real shit, rather than intellectual masturbation, then that dichotomy doesn't really exists. 

The majority of people can't organically occupy a *strictly* pessimistic or optimistic worldview. Nietzsche himself joked about Arthur Schopenhauer enjoying uplifting afternoons playing his instrument despite the latter's talk of the insatiable will-to-life. We're complex. Nihilism doesn't magically blow away that complexity like some secular version of nirvana.

1695309318.0,Word of advice/suggestion for nihilists: get into bushcraft/homesteading/camping if you want to have any hope of escaping society.,"Every day there's a post about ""muh society bad leave me alone"". 

Honestly those popular bushcrafters and survivalists should target nihilists as an audience - ""The Nihilist's Guide to Bushcraft or Escaping into the Woods"" or some shit. Or nihilists should band together and form a nihilist version of The Amish or the Mennonites. 

The truth is, you can’t survive without society as you are. That’s a fact. If you left now, with no training, no studying, no experience, and no tribe members to fall back on, you’d die of starvation or exposure to the elements within a month.

As a member of industrial society, you don’t know how to survive outside of it through non-industrial means. You have no traditional bushcraft/woodcraft skills or knowledge.

You likely don’t know how to set up even a basic shelter such as a tarp or tent/hammock. You don’t know how to hunt or trap or field dress what you kill to avoid getting sick. You don’t know how to forage for edibles or what edibles are even present in your region. You don’t know how to find drinkable water or how to treat or filter water etc etc.

And keep in mind, many of those things you need to set up those basic things such as tarps require supplies from “society” such as good cordage (unless you know how to make your own from plant materials) like bankline or 550 paracord. You’d also need a gun, also made by and bought from “society” (unless you literally know how to flintknap stone and make primitive bows - not easy, even the stonecraft of far more primitive human species such as Homo erectus requires a lot of training to master). You need fire starting kits and systems (unless you know how to use primitive methods such as fire plough or bow and drill).

What I’m saying is, unless you grew up as a hunter gatherer and learned the traditional bushcraft skills and knowledge, you need society, like it or not.

So your one shot at escaping society is extreme self reliance and that requires extreme training and knowledge as well as some compromise with society - you still need to suck on it's teat somewhat to get off the ground. ",0

And then I look at my COMPUTER and see that it is the most complex machinery ever known to man. Clearly, again the developers of the machine were not suicidal or depressed.

But what is the point of the computer existing? Well 2 main reasons:

1)To masturbate to hot videos and pictures.

2)To, ironically go on r/suicidewatch and talk about how life is existential HELL.

1695157651.0,"My experience with meaninglessness, formlessness and existential depression and realizations I've had","I'm finding it brings more sanity to embrace this feeling and way of thinking rather than treat it as a mental disorder or something that's wrong with us.

Some people will say it's depression, but this is existential depression not a chemical depression.  They are two different things.  I think it's just something that comes from awareness and realizing that just chasing highs in life doesn't bring fulfillment in life.  I was reminded of this today as someone I knew just died.  When you realize death can happen at any time, you realize how dumb it is to just be going through the motions in life, even if you feel good and have pleasure or drive in your life, you are still living like a mindless animal pursuing pleasure for pleasure's sake.  If you died tomorrow, how would you feel?  Was it all worth it?  

Personally, the pleasure I pursued for much of my life was the pleasure of listening to music.  It was the closest thing to finding meaning in life that I had.  A genuine passion.  And when I was younger, that was still exciting, but then it wore off.  I was also aware that I wasn't actually living and didn't feel like I was living.  

It all made sense to me when I was learning about people's experience taking a medication that helped stop their food cravings so that they would lose weight.  But not only did they feel less need to eat, but they also became less interested in pleasure-seeking pursuits like shopping or working out.  Having lost the compulsive drive to pursue pleasure, they had to now make more conscious decisions about what they wanted to do with their lives than be lead by compulsion.

The concept of the ""monkey mind"" also makes a lot of sense here.  I feel all these things that made me feel good or have fun were just distracting.  I still love music, but I approach it differently now, and it has a different meaning to me.  In decluttering my life, my mind and my sensory environment, I've found myself closer to having an idea of what can make my life feel less like nothing.  I have a closer idea of where my heart really is and what I want to try to pursue in life.  

I think a lot of people deep down inside feel the nothingness of their lives, and desperately pursue things to fill that feeling of nothing.  For example, they try to prove that they're somebody by having some accomplishment or by trying to be pretty or prove that they're talented or useful.  Then they can at least think their life is something or they are somebody even though they are empty deep down inside.  People also are often too busy to think and have awareness of the emptiness to even know what they feel, but that doesn't mean that they're saner.

One of the most enlightening experiences I've had with facing the formlessness of life is working a job where I simply greeted people at the front door to a store.  I felt like I was just watching my life pass me by.  It really wasn't just about that job but about literally having watched so much of life pass me by.  You just become more aware of it when you can see the nothingness for hours every day and aren't busy or distracted.  Although I've had other jobs that kept me more occupied and even entertained, I still find myself feeling empty and facing existential crises after work once I have a chance to check in with myself.  Because life for me isn't about being busy or happy all the time.  And anyone who tells me that it is, to me is a superficial idiot and I don't want their life advice.  It's a philosophy that actually disturbs me, to be honest.

One thing that's made it harder for me to pursue a life that feels more like something than nothing is my problems with brain fog, ADHD, complex PTSD, abuse and dissociation.  All that stuff made it harder for me to find direction in my life and took me further from myself, from knowing who I really am, where my heart is and what really brings me satisfaction in life.  It also led to having a life unlived.  But maybe sometimes it's when you lose everything that you have more clarity.  Well, that's another discussion to get into.

But honestly, I feel like our entire culture is manic and empty, and that's why it's so hard to make sense of life for the rest of us to find something to fill the emptiness.  Because the only examples we have of how to live life are bad examples.",0

Nothing in the world has inherent value—you must give it value.

Nothing matters—every bit of food you eat is the best food you’ve ever had in your life. From a 5 star restaurant to the Rice-a-Roni you have at midnight.

Random trinkets you find at antique shops or gas stations? Relics. Swimming for the first time that year at the start of summer? A Baptism. You make your own meaning.

It’s not that nothing matters, it’s that nothing has intrinsic meaning—so you get to make it for yourself!",0
1695086095.0,How do you explain your lack of belief to others?,"I have recently smoked with a friend. He's a Christian man and we like to engage in really healthy and thoughtful conversations about or conflicting thoughts. We don't see each other often so when we do, these types of conversations happen alot. 

This specific time, we conversed about what nihilism is (e asked me) and then went into more detail regarding the topic. 

At one point I told him that I seriously disregard morals and ethics as guiding life rules yet I preside by then so that I can live a life without too much turmoil. 

He then brought up the deep dark questions (which I enjoy. But these ones took me by surprise) 

He asked me something along the lines of 
""Without a fundamental belief in morals or ethics, do you think sex with children is okay?""

As you could imagine, that's not something that's ever really come up. I froze for a moment and said no. 

Now fundamentally, I personally believe we are all creatures just *doing things* but I am also repulsed by his question. Does that mean I am not actually nihilistic? I am 24 and was a devout christian up until the age of 14. I am very willing to change my thoughts on life and just want to learn things. This has been a topic of contention amongst my thoughts for days now. 

Would just like to discuss your thoughts on the darker implications of the inheritant rejections of ""morals""(if you have any)",0

1694931772.0,"The older I get, the more I realize that life is not worth living","As I grow older, I increasingly realize that life may not be what we were promised when we were children. It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

&#x200B;

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

&#x200B;

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

&#x200B;

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

&#x200B;

Of course, it's possible to be happy, but it requires finding one's path, having a long-term vision, making efforts, and being lucky. Nevertheless, I still feel deeply unhappy seeing that it is probably too late for me.

The things that make you want to see another pointless and recursive day. Imagine if it was stripped away from you? Imagine if it fell through your hands like sand on the beach? See, people have a myriad of copes to distract themselves until death. Video games, music, and movies/shows are copes. A girlfriend or wife is a cope. Having kids is a cope. Traveling is a cope. Your job is a cope. And of course, your drugs such as alcohol and cigarettes is a major cope. Why continue to live this life? Sure, you can blame it on survival instincts. Sure, you can lie to yourself and come up with reasons to keep living but It doesn't really matter what you turn your attention towards. The result will remain the same. Living and dying. Waking up to start a pointless day and going back to sleep and waking up to start the same day again and again. Yes, it's a cyclical process but you do it anyway. What else can you do with your pointless life? You need something to delay the inevitable. It's like a person who has cancer. They know that death will come at anytime but they continue to distract themselves because that is all they can do. We all meet at the same destination. Next stop is death! 💀⚰️🚂 when that day comes, you will see that whatever you did in your life, amounted to nothing! 

There is no scoring board on who lived the best life. Into the ground you go with the worms. 🪱💀 The graveyard is waiting for all of us. 🪦we were never in control of our lives. If you are in control right now then stop yourself from dying. You can't do that. Why? Because you have no control over your life. Continue to feed the body with nourishment to temporarily sustain yourself. You will experience death. It will happen to all of us. There is no escape. Our fates are sealed! It has been etched in stone. There is no stopping our fate. Even words and disagreement won't stop our fate. People will die and kids will be born into this world and grow up and die. It's simple as that. You can't change reality. However, you are free to remain a fool. You are free to play games with your mind to keep from going insane. nothing can be achieved here. Being rich and wealthy is not important to me. When you are rich and wealthy, you have more resources to play around with. You pretty much live a more comfortable life until you die. But when you get bored, then what happens? What if you grew accustomed to being rich and wealthy? you will get use to it. The feeling of pointlessness will creep in and swallow you hole!


We are all doomed to die. Consider yourself dead because it's going to happen anyway. When you see or hear people die, it's just a reminder that you will die, too. Death is all around us. You are watching people die and they will be watching you die. An eye for an eye. 👁️ no pun intended, of course. 😌",0

1694785040.0,Are most living nihilists not just absurdists or existentialists?,"I’ve never quite understood the delineation between absurdism and nihilism - it seems to me that continuing to live within a meaningless existence in which the only guarantee is suffering represents perforce an act of rebellion and therefore couldn’t it be said that all nihilists who have foregone killing themselves are absurdists, or possibly just plain old existentialists? 

Nihilism denotes a disavowal of any god or superstitious nonsense, so there’s nothing of that sort preventing a nihilist from killing themselves, and the only real barrier would be fear surrounding the potential pain and failing the attempt and wishing you were dead more than ever as you wind up invalided or disfigured.

Foregoing suicide out of concern for loved ones indicates that one has placed at least some value in the wellbeing of others which isn’t compatible with nihilism by definition. 

I have a colleague who’s labelled himself a voyeuristic nihilist, who sticks around to roast marshmallows as the world burns, but reading between the lines he’s a far cry from a nihilist, for even the act of living for morbid curiosity or amusement still seems incompatible with nihilism, at most he’s an absurdist but even then he seems like more of an existentialist since there’s a lot he does seem to genuinely care about even if he denies it. I’m not sure I’ve ever met a true nihilist or ever will at least not in the land of the living. 

The way I see it, even allowing oneself to experience momentary joy, laughter, awe, intrigue etc is tacit acceptance that there are things worth living for even if they hold no cosmic meaning and don’t hold a candle to the suffering.

One meaning of life imo that is independent of religion is to simply live. Nature in itself is an inherent meaning/purpose of life and nature has led to you being born. It has given you an inherent desire to live with love and morals - that is HUMAN nature. As far as we know at the minute we could be the only truly self aware species in the universe. That means we could be the only beings able to study and apply meaning to the universe around us… and those who wish to simply live as though there isn’t a meaning are not necessarily right in doing so.

I was raised in an immigrant household and always found fulfillment in my achievements. I’ve always been an overachiever because I believed you get out what you put in. But now after graduating from a good school, getting my “dream” job, purchasing my first house I feel empty because I don’t have a partner to share it with. I know i sound ungrateful but I’ve descended into nihilism because all these things feel meaningless if they aren’t contributing towards a future family. I didnt accomplish these things just to be alone. I’ve done so much self work, trying out new hobbies, going to therapy, building strong friendships and supporting my family. But when i lay in bed at night and think about repeating life like this for another 30 or so years, it feels absolutely pointless. I used to quiet my depressive thoughts with retail therapy but it’s not even satisfying anymore cause there’s nothing I really need or want. 

I’m really disillusioned with love and companionship. I’m an attractive woman who has no issue getting a first date, but all the men I’ve cared for left me once they slept with me. I know everyone says not to let romantic partners determine your worth, but all of my friends have had at least one solid relationship while no one I’ve cared ever cared to call me their girlfriend. I’m a self proclaimed hopeless romantic, but now I just feel hopeless. 

I have loving friends and family who I know need me, but I just envisioned my life being different by now. 

Then I look at the world and how volatile our climate is with raging wildfires and floods happening more frequently by the day, the inability for the average person to meet their basic human needs due to the greed of the ultra wealthy, the resulting violent crimes and unrest because of our economic system, our societies obsession with facades on social media and worshipping the same people who only see them as cash cows for their empire, the fact that the US food system is poisoning us for profit, the loss of true critical independent thinking and I’m like what future is there for me to even desire bringing children into the world. Even if I got lucky and found someone who was a good partner, can I in good faith feel good about raising a child today? Not only are there more problems than solutions, but the problems seem to increase the more we peel back the curtain of the global market forces that control every aspect of our human existence.

But why does anything NEED meaning? What’s so wrong about just existing and playing the video game, however it ends up?

No brain = no problem.

Frontal lobe looks for problem. (Because it loves to solve problems).

When you are thinking ""What is the meaning of life?"", it means your brain thinks that there is a problem (= Why I am suffering?) but since there is no problem (no meaning in life) it makes you suffer.

So what's my point ? My point is, the lack of meaning in life is neutral, the suffering indulged by nihilism is created by the brain (because it is bored, depressed, stressed...).

Boredome = lack of stimulation, dopamine
Depression = disregulation of serotonine/dopamine
Stress = adrenaline, cortisol
 
Etc

That is why animals doesn't commits suicide. (One argument is that they are too dumb to understand the concept of suicide but it is also because their frontal lobe is lower, they aren't looking for a problem/thinking).",0

It remains to understand that human behavior is an expression of instincts. And for this, you don't need thousands of studies; you need simple logic. Everything is determined. That's it. But people lack logic. They are emotional machines programmed to seek pleasure. Their consciousness in all its manifestations is an emotional machine; every thought is an emotion, and under the influence of these emotions, they begin to think that they are endowed with free will, that someone up there cares for them, or there is some purpose in all this absurdity. It's very pleasant; it's pleasant as to become a fascist under the influence of herd instinct and hierarchy, masturbating in your head about how you are superior, that your herd is better than others, and you are higher in the hierarchy. Without this nonsense in your head, which stimulates your brain with pleasant sensations when you think about some transcendence - the 'god spot' - the posterior cingulate cortex, which, if stimulated, makes you feel the presence of God, you would never start this absurd journey or would quickly realize that it's all absurd and mechanistic.

But it's worth adding that the difference between 'real people' and mere animals is that their brains can cut the connection with the primordial (though it never frees you from causality; all your behavior ultimately is an expression of the primordial), that their neurons can break free from the primordial stimulus and loop themselves (or under the influence of strong emotional impact, transform into something with a constant influx of emotions). What this frees you from is emotional epilepsy, allowing you to suppress other programs and freeing you from suffering, among other things. It makes you happier than the people around you if it turns out to be stronger than everything else in your head. In my case, it's the instinct of curiosity - simply jerking off to the comparison of structures and extracting common patterns from them; the brain gets high on how complex the pattern is. This became my path, freed from the simple pleasure of getting a dose of high, it eventually turned into something that understood that thinking with logic alone is pleasurable, grasped the essence, cut out a large part of unnecessary programs, and here I am, possibly one of the happiest people on this planet. It only remains to free oneself from all the other junk, except for two worthy programs.

Yes, I am not consciousness. I look into myself, as Buddha said, 'Now it should become clear.' Consciousness is just a center immersed in the seizure of the moment's sensations. A homunculus incapable of realizing what happened a millisecond ago. A part of the brain programmed to immerse itself fully in emotions. I feel, I feel, I feel. I am a perch, a perch, a perch. And then it comes to the conclusion that it feels. The scheme of its operation is simple - it chooses the most enjoyable option. Ultimately, all emotions and all sensations are illusions, and even pain is probably an illusion.",0

I have grown to dislike life itself, finding little to no enjoyment out of anything. I can’t envision a life for myself, I have no desires or aspirations. I have no purpose or meaning. I find no enjoy in life, only suffering. I feel that I care too much about the suffering, whether it be mine or in general. 

I have been depressed for years and have grown comfortable in it, almost liking it. I don’t even know if I want to get better anymore, because I only see suicide as a good option. I don’t believe that I can change. 

I cannot stand living, it hurts sometimes. I feel like I am stuck inside this vessel, this flesh, and it’s eating away at me. It haunts me even more knowing that no one will ever be able to understand my feelings and how deep they really go, since they can not really feel it themselves.

I am tired of people forcing me to go on living, like my life isn’t my choice. I am tired of living so that others mustn’t mourn or because of this idea that at some unidentifiable time in the future I might want to be alive. 

Healthcare professionals are terrible, mental hospitals are horrible, and pills/therapy are not working for me. Everything that they know is a lie, and everything that they push out is based on this belief that they are helping.

They're wrong

All atheism means is that we know we have physical limits to those things. God is not going to save the planet when we ruin it. He isn't going to make sure a bad person gets punished. And supposedly God is their reason for doing anything: He doesn't need anything from us. I wonder how they derive meaning sacrificing themselves for someone who can't possibly care

On the other hand, we have plenty of options for meaning. Meaning is a human construct. We created it. Does something have to last forever for it to be meaningful? Nope.

Do you have a family? Friends? Do they need you sometimes? When you come through, does it mean something to them? Or do they respond, ""I am not glad for your help. We will all be dead eventually""

You're alone. You will never find love. Do you work with other people? Do they depend on your work? Do you play some role in creating something? Do you create anything outside of work? Do you enjoy and find meaning in other things that other people create? Food? Movies? Video games? How about pure achievement in competition or recognition? Or strangers. Make someone's life better. Or make everyone's lives better

There are so many different options for finding meaning in life. The delusion is thinking someone assigned your life meaning, when we were the ones all along. Yes, you can't achieve everything, just like you can't fly. And that's ok. So pick a bunch of things and the odds are low that you won't feel some sense of fulfillment

I want to draw your attention to an [article](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/effects-of-beauty-found-to-run-surprisingly-deep-nyt) in the New York Times written all the way back in 1981.

This is interesting because it's an old article from 40 years ago that has a lot of insight into the social problems we face today. This was written by a female university professor.

When I hear people say ""oh, you're just an inkwell dude,"" I have to ask: is she an inkwell as well? Are you gonna call her one too?

The article reads:

""Minneapolis studies of physical attractiveness show that people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover, often with dramatic effects on those being judged. The findings suggest that expectations based on physical attractiveness can become self-fulfilling prophecies that may strongly influence the course of a person's life.""

Precisely. You might even say ""[determine](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063975) the course of a person's life.""

Most people are usually only concerned about how they're perceived by the opposite sex, but your [looks dictate other aspects of your life as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757567/).

When you say this out loud, [people don't like it](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7290948) because it goes against their core belief that [people are in charge of their futures](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/).

But looks indeed do strongly influence the course of a person's life. [Looks often trigger a chain reaction.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.1.116) [One thing triggers another and leads to the ne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/)xt.

Looks are really such a major determining factor of [every avenue of life.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370)

I'm not saying you can't accomplish something great otherwise, but you'll have to be exceptionally talented and hardworking. [You'll have to work twice as hard to get the same chances and opportunities](https://humboldt-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/2148/624/ThesisFinal.pdf).

""Dr. Berscheid said the importance of physical attractiveness is growing and will continue to grow as increases in geographic mobility, frequent job changes and divorce subject more people to 'onetime' or 'few-time' interactions with others, in which they are judged on the basis of first impressions.""

[What she said indeed came to pass](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1908630116), but I'm sure even she was surprised at the [magnitude of it](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html).

""The psychologist, who has been studying the effects of physical attractiveness for the last 15 years, said the findings 'give new dimensions to Freud's statement that ""Anatomy is destiny.""'""

This was really insightful coming from her, considering that it's an article from 1981. She talked about these issues in the 60s, about the importance of looks, how it shapes other aspects of your life, how it'll be even more important in the future.

[And she was proven right.](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-019-0244-4#Sec10)

""'Genetic determinism is anathema to Americans, who want to believe everyone is born equal, with an equal chance for a happy life,' Dr. Berscheid remarked in an interview here. 'It's simply not so. The most important factors governing success in life are genetically determined: appearance, intelligence, sex and height.' She cited a continuing study at the University of Minnesota of identical twins who had been reared apart. The study, she says, is showing that 'genetically identical children turn out to be very similar even though they grow up in very different environments.'""

She almost nailed it. The idea of genetic determinism is indeed anathema to most people on earth, not only Americans. It's an uncomfortable idea. It challenges the validity of a lot of moral values and beliefs in society that comtemporary laws stand up on: [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/), [justice](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm#), [the belief that we're in charge of our lives and decisions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), [the idea that we are responsible for our fates](https://www.edcor.com/newsletter/jack-welch-on-pursuing-your-passion/), [the notion of objective right and wrong](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), etc.

The idea of genetic determinism brings a lot of these ideas into question.

[The most important factor is indeed looks](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/health/ugly-children-may-get-parental-short-shrift.html), first and foremost, which is genetics.

Then, I'd say opportunities and environment, rather than sheer intelligence, are the next most important. I slightly disagree with her here. [Which country you were born in](https://data.who.int/countries/426), [your race](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36347), [which family you were born into](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/research-generational-wealth), all of which are determined by luck.

Next in order, according to Berschied, is a person's sex. That is true, but it's the other way around. [It's girls who have a head start over boys](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X17302584).

Then again, she was born in 1936, and she grew up in the 1940s and 1950s when [women didn't have de facto equality](https://apnews.com/article/50fb651b7fb84221887f8a7534a87fff), so I'm gonna give her a pass here.

""The preferential treatment of physically attractive people starts right after birth, Dr. Berscheid noted, and continues throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. These are among the more telling research findings, all of which involved normal-looking people of varying degrees of attractiveness:""

Keep in mind that scientifically more airtight studies that came out in the last 40 years [not only confirm the aforementioned evidence](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30766-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218307668%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), but also show that looks are [even more important than previously thought](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092656621000131).

[The rabbit hole goes even deeper](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016363839890011X). A baby born yesterday knows that it's over for you.

This is beyond brutal, man.

""As women become more independent socially and economically, Dr. Berscheid sees them placing a greater emphasis on the attractiveness of men, 'who are now in the ""meat market"" just like women have always been.' She cited the recent advent of male centerfolds and male nude dancers as examples of women's interests in how men look.

Another factor has been the importance women today place on love as a criterion for choosing a mate. In 1967 only 24 percent of women questioned said they would marry only if they were in love, but a decade later, 80 percent said 'being in love' was a necessary condition for marriage.""

She really saw it coming considering that she was born in 1936 and grew up in the 1950s. But even she likely underestimated the [effects of looks](https://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf), [the invention of dating apps](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2087), and [more](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/02/SDT-Intermarriage-II.pdf) in the new millennium.

""'When romantic love becomes an important factor in social choice, physical attractiveness becomes important also,' Dr. Berscheid told a symposium on the psychological aspects of facial form last year. The symposium brought together plastic surgeons, dentists and others who produce facial changes that often affect patients more powerfully than the functional defects they correct.

Sometimes patients react badly -'with pain and bewilderment' - to significant improvements in their appearance, Dr. Berscheid told the meeting at the University of Michigan. This reaction could result from the realization that **we are not just loved for ourselves but for what we look like**, she suggested.""

This is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people.

""Dr. Berscheid believes there is a hazard inherent in denying the impact of physical attractiveness: 'Unattractive children who are unpopular may wrongly attribute their lack of popularity to some flaw in their character or personality,' she says. Such an error, she believes, could result in lasting and painful scars.""

[Again, she nails it](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373). It happens all the time. [Which is why a lot of naive men fall victim to PUAs and redpill scammers](https://jacobin.com/2023/03/andrew-tate-capitalism-scam-misogyny-alienation-hustle). Those guys blame themselves: ""oh, I must be doing something wrong,"" when [it's usually about their looks](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/howyourraceaffectsthemessagesyouget.html).

The main takeaway is this:

**Anatomy is destiny, and you can't really fight destiny.**

1694008536.0,Meaning and economics.,"A while ago I've got a job, and with it came a pleasant irrational feeling: a feeling of doing something of value, of being meant for something, in a sense.

It's not that I wanted that feeling, it actually has surprised me, that it exists. The job itself isn't particularly inspiring or profitable.

One feature that may be important is that I'm not ""alienated"" from the results of my work, I see it solving problems of other collegues in the real time.

Now everything starts making sense: why people prefer creative jobs, why employers boast about company ""mission"", why some even spend resources and time to volunteer. Everything points at the feeling of purpose being a thing of value.

1693926396.0,Unusual Philosophical Question While Watching an Adam Sadler Movie,"When I was a kid, I watched alot of movies.  My family was particularly fond of comedies which included Adam Sadler movies. 

There was a movie my mom loved, called ""Fifty First Dates"" with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sadler. This movie always made me feel uneasy, and I didn't know it at the time, but it would eventually give me an Epiphany. 

Still a child, I wondered what it would be like to be Drew Barrymores character. Someone who had been in a car accident, resulting in short term memory loss where you reset every 24 hours. 

Let's aside the creepy notion of waking up everyday in unusual situation forced to face the fact your pregnant, older, with strangers and your dad's dead. I was more preoccupied with the thought of what her experience was like in the car accident. 

So here's my question, If you lossed your memory everyday, and the last thing you remembered was the car accident, did your consciousness die? Are you but a walking corpse waiting to expire? 

You wake up with no memory after that, you go to bed and what you did that day dissappears. Now, Drew Barrymore says she sees Adam Sadler in her dreams and writes it in a journal. But that's the body talking yeah? She has to record those dreams, she doesn't remember those dreams the next day. Is she stuck in purgatory? 

The last memory she will know is crashing in a car, from her point of view, she will die and that's the last memory she could remember. So did she die back then? And if you can lose that memory, and not experience more from then on, what makes life meaningful if you can still live and not remember any of it? 

I've always centered this question as the reason I got into philosophy and found solstice in nihilism. I believe if I was in that car crash, the drive with my dad would've been the last thing I saw before entering the void. The rest was my body operating itself.

1693879276.0,Psychological bias about nihilism,"Through several introspections, I've come to realize that when my ideas turn nihilistic, it's often during psychological impasses, moments of indifference, when everything seems futile. It's as if my brain resorts to this as a defense mechanism when my emotions (anxiety, guilt, hatred, frustration, sadness) become so overwhelming that they can't be countered. Normally, the lack of meaning doesn't bother me much; it's a mild desire, so to speak. But when I'm in a state of depression, I feel that lack intensified.

I can see my emotions and the thoughts they've spawned. Intense guilt led me into a determinism mindset (making me believe I had no other choice, so not my fault, hence indifference). Strong anxiety made me think that nothing matters in the end, that everyone will be forgotten. Depression convinced me that we suffer for nothing, so the rational choice would be to die.

Then, when I start to feel better, these thoughts I've created (guilt = determinism, anxiety = don't care, depression = don't matter) ultimately turn against me. It's as if nihilism has this duality of positive/negative outcomes.",0

1693814523.0,Do secular Zen Buddhism contradict Nihilism? Nihilists were destroyed in India. Zen is Nihilistic.,"I think Zen and Nihilism doesn't necessarily contradict each other except Zen advices you to cultivate Emptiness of Mind. Why? Because we have to face life so we should have ability to not worry about everything trivial. Since it's an active path and so Buddhists will deny it as Nihilistic. 

Another reason is Buddhism spread with the support of Ancient Indian Kings like Ashoka The Great and he converted to Buddhism from Hinduism to gain political advantage and killed many minorities including a Nihilist philosophical school. It proves that being a Nihilist school means Indian kings will come for you at that time. Also some scholars in Ancient India probably complained to Kings that promoting Buddhism will ruin the Economy.
 I watched a video which mentioned that Kautilya, famous scholar, banned people from religious activities and forced people to raise economy than waste time on Gods. He only allowed Religious rituals as it improved trade compared to sitting in meditation doing nothing. He advised kings to restrict Buddhism more because Hindus were contributing more to GDP. But Ashoka probably saw Buddhism as advantage and rejected Kautilya.

This information is subject to bias because I received them from YouTube videos and Indian history videos can have political impact.

Overall, I believe Buddhists subscribe to meaning in life because people always rejected nihilism and killed them. In India, it was not Theism vs Atheism but Nihilism (Nastika) and Non-nihilism (Astika). Every philosopher tried their best to explain why ""we are not nihilists"" as the debates took place in King's royal court. Buddhism could not have survived without rejecting Nihilism.",0

I’ve never gone through such a consistent back to back cases of misfortune and shitty events than I have these past few months, but I’ll just fast forward to more recently to make a long ass story just long. Having to live with my “friends” after I got kicked out by my mom we arranged on me helping out on rent, least I could do ofc. Well a week before the actual rent was due my tire literally blue out so I ended up having to pay for roadside assistance and a new tire. This ofc fucked my savings up so I ended up late on my share of the rent, understandable as it is to be frustrated at late rent I’d think my friends would understand it was a situation of an unfortunate event I had no control of and not me just simply not wanting to pay rent.

This didn’t stop my “friend” from telling the others in my friend group how I’m just this freeloader that’s not paying my rent, going around giving me a bad name when he knew exactly what my situation was. This month I was on time despite another incident of my car being repoed (I was behind because our landlord fucked us over and I had to literally take out loans to help with moving expenses and a down payment on the new place when I was living with my mom). I’m visibly stressed at the possibility of my car being auctioned off, still having to go to my retail job, and having to come back to my “friends” shitting on me on a game chat behind my back about me “not paying my bills” etc etc. All of this on top of me still recovering from a nasty falling out with the only parent I had.

This summer has fucked my mental state up and I truly feel alone on this. No one close to me cares they’d rather just laugh at my expense. Best believe once I get my shit together and move out in cutting these people off completely. This was a learning experience for me, trust no one.

Religions try to give things a point - you live, and if you live the correct way you will end up being ""happy"" forever.

Being ""happy"" is the conclusion that your brain reaches when the stimuli to which you are subjected are parsed by your neural circuitry and releases neurochemicals that you interpret as ""being happy"".

It is completely unknown if you have nerves and neurons in any religious concept - they don't talk about it. Nobody claims to know if neurochemistry exists in some form in ""heaven"" or ""hell"".

1693461781.0,Is feeling good intrinsically meaningful?,"The one thing that challenges Nihilism for me is that our desire to feel good seems hardwired in by the universe. You can say that ""happiness and love are just chemical reactions"" but that means any materialist has to admit that dead inert materials like chemicals are creating intense desires. You are a bunch of inert materials having feelings, aren't you?

As nihilists we say that the universe doesn't care how we feel, but if we are just bits of the universe moving around, not separate from it, then it's the universe itself that wants to be happy, in the form of humans and animals.

Larger trends in the universe that cause change, like gravity and electromagnetism, are the same forces causing the chemicals in our brains to desire happiness and good feelings, and those good feelings are the result of more complex thoughts like, ""I completed what I wanted to complete"" or ""I am fitting in to the social environment.""

This would suggest the universe is attempting to move towards a certain state of existence, but has become scrambled and divided up. Each individual piece of it is trying to reach internal harmony even though that pursuit disrupts other parts of the universe, actions and reactions bumping around causing disharmony to continue on timescales far beyond our awareness.

So this would mean that our core desire to feel good was intrinsically meaningful. A small representation of the overall pull towards a stable harmonious state that the universe is attempting to land in.

Indeed, we do live in a universe that is indifferent to us, but within that framework, we, as part of the human collective, are actively charting our own path. 

I don't know; to me, it's difficult to find meaning while being part of a collective (our species) that is so dysfunctional.   


Below is the intro to the article. 

&#x200B;

**Evolution mirrors time itself.**

&#x200B;

Evolution mirrors time itself. It is related to the process of spiritual awakening. Inefficiencies in our biological neural network accumulate due to maladaptive programming. Spiritual awakening triggers a rapid integration process, exposing and re-coding these maladaptive traits as we become our higher self. The act requires us to break through the matrix, re-evaluating and consciously changing our hierarchy of values. Collectively, this process makes our biological neural network more efficient. The result is an enhanced ability to process information. Spiritual awakening leads to a profound evolution within the self. This transformation heightens awareness and mindfulness, altering the way we perceive time as if time is moving more slowly. The spiritual awakening represents an evolutionary shift.

1693408125.0,Finding Purpose in a Deterministic Universe,"I saw a post earlier about the deterministic universe. I thought I share this blog post that speaks well to me.  

  
**Finding Purpose in a Deterministic Universe**

When we act on our biological instincts, desires, and programming, we are merely objects—subjugated by a broken society in a deterministic universe.

In the ego development process, we initially identify with ourselves but eventually move towards a sense of universality. This means our compassion and interconnectedness expand to include more members of our species. Our collective species also undergoes its own stages of ego development. Individuals who wield power influence this direction. Other mechanisms, such as industries and organizations, also play a role. Despite this, a structural problem persists where the most corrupted individuals wield the most power. Collectively, our species has maladapted to its crises.

One avenue to elevate the collective ego development of our species is by enhancing individual spirituality. In this context, I associate higher spiritual levels with more advanced stages of ego development. As an individual, you are subjugated by both a flawed society and a deterministic universe. The journey towards finding your authentic self is an act that defies the deterministic nature governing us.

However minuscule, when you embark on this path, you defy the determinism that governs us.

1693251094.0,Can you solve this?,"Even if there was an absolute truth, people would still have the free will to be able to choose to live their lives without aligning themselves with it, being considered wrong. And the only way to align yourself with this absolute truth would be to have a subjective reason internally, because even if there is this truth, which dictates what is right, you still have to go over the question: Why do what is right? And the answer to this question will always be subjective, it's what connects the person to this supposed truth. The reason may be wanting to be right, wanting to act according to the truth, which are reasons that, different from the absolute truth, could still be questioned (vulnerable to infinite regress) and therefore without foundation. Since we live in a world that lacks intrinsic meaning the same thing goes, what governs is the subjective. All choices are subject to the subjective and it is impossible to make a non-subjective choice, therefore they are not rational.

Nihilism determines an absolute truth, which is that there are no absolute truths, so someone who aligns with this philosophical position has an adjacent subjective motivation, which is subjective, falls before infinite regression and therefore has no foundation, it is a lie , an illusion. Realizing it, the person realizes that the search for truth (their subjective motivation) is a lie, a deception. But the person, when trying to stop practicing a lie that would be the act of seeking the truth, he begins to look for ways to get around the situation and leave the lie to seek the truth, but in this he is back in the search for the truth that is a lie, how to get out of this dilemma?",0

I like her but we're not even close and we're really different. She hitted on me whereas I wasn't even imagining it.

Since the beginning of the thing we agreed on a open non exclusive relationship. I didn't have any issue with it, why the fuck would I care if she wants to fuck other men? As long as we're safe and she doesn't brag about it it's fine. At the end it doesn't matter right? 3 months later I grew to care about it for no intelligible reason. I'm thinking about how she's spending time with other men that are better than me and I end up frustrated when we don't have sex. I'm masturbating a lot more than beforehand and I even look for new hookups, which I never did in my life.

I felt so damn more peaceful before experiencing this nonsense. It truly feels like it's just a mix of gut feelings pumped by hormones.  
Evolution programmed us to react like this. It has probably nothing to do with my relationship. It has to do with how I'm supposed to keep other competitors away from my mate. Making sure your mate is exclusive to you is how you maximize the chances to propagate your DNA. There's no reasoning behind this.

I do think that things matter at the end if the day, but I'm so detached from reality and I genuinely have a dislike for the human race. I've been suicidal since middle school, since a child, I've watched my parents fight and argue, and i remember specifically, that period of time made me question people. I didn't understand them. So I throughout the years I've just been asking questions, finding answers that lead to even bigger questions.

I always had an interest in psychology. I was always in tune with my own emotions and the more information I obtained, the more deep into my subconscious I went. I have face my shadow self and still fighting with him to come to terms with how I want to go about life. I'm at a point where I could either be an unambitious hermit with nothing but knowledge and perspectives to give, or I can try to make something of myself and establish my name in the world, but at what cost.

Having to take care of your body, look after yourself, all of it is a chore for me. I want to get away from it all. A lot of things people find important, I either don't care about, or I'm indifferent. That's why I'm anxious to want to try and make new friends. I'd rather just stick with the people I know. I feel a bit scared to share my opinions and thoughts with the people of today cause society's gotten so sensitive over the years. It's ok to care about other's feelings, but people align their identities with certain beliefs and ideologies, to where if you disagree with them, you are attacking who they are.

That's why politics are dumb af. It's a form of segregation. One side stands for one, and the other side stands for that. So if you don't vote for one side, you are immediately *AGAINST* the other side. This is why the world will never know peace and acceptance for all walks of life and people of different discographies. 

The internet would rather cancel or bash someone instead of helping them become better. We condemn people for having certain beliefs, voting for certain people, expressing themselves a certain way, we might as while go back to segregation. All the LGBT over there, all the heteros over there, minorities over there, and non minorities over there. Left handed over there, right handed over here. Maybe then we could stop the constant bickering back and forth. But where does that leave people like me who associate with many things? Or simply don't care. Why can't people just be. If you dont like something, stop centering your attention around it. Ignore it. Detach.

I always had the thought of living outside of society. Away from the barrage of social media, politics, racism, violence, all of it. I just want to be around trees, water, nature, the sun and moon.

""Eventually you're gonna die whether by sickness or natural causes, and no-ones gonna remember you and u wouldn't be there anymore to remember all of those failures and successes in your life you wouldnt be there to remember all those embarrassing and prideful moments of your life, nothing matters and there is no good nor evil here, there is no such a thing as shame or pride only suffering"", 

and all of a sudden I was relaxed, couldn't give a fuck about my past or future anymore, it felt like I was bathed with a warm and soothing feeling rushing through my body, I felt peace and all the voices had gone quiet, i could breathe normally again and was able to relax my jaw. (sometimes I don't realize how tight my jaw is)

I don't know how to describe the feeling, I can only say that: I felt peace and kindness.
and it's all because of you guys and your pov of the world, people on this sub have taught me a lot, your ideology of life saves me from the voices in my head, and I owe this peacefulness (even though temporary) to you ❤️

1692843681.0,"so as everything is determined all your behaviour goes from instincts, seems consiousness is a lie, at least people minds around absolutely delusional and they work on instincts especially hierarchy, so","people read your emotional state like animals just by outcomes in the end subconsciously, all your behaviour in the end expression of instincts(yeah there is a next step, when part of brain cuts itself from instinctual root and you start working like on habit without original reason, but it don't free you from casuality really, you just forget, but you grown from instinct). anyways symbols connected, all nazi, racists, loves swastika, not just common ones but any like ""colovrat"" for example and similar with square ends and they pretend it's just beautifull(just make a research, you will see great correlation), most gays and womans love guro, all interconnected and a lot of other stuff connected, everything is connected.

that's why some shizos love to say that everything in your mind. the thing is you really define by yourself your status also, as everything interconnected your instincts connect your status with money, proffession, intellect, strength and your working in instinctive society with hierarchy and expressing your behaviour, surrender or be a master.

really it's a hierarchy instinct - slave/master. goes from the start - expansion - conquering - humilating. nature defines the best ones who is better at humilating, womans love the best ones. nature made a trickiest trick here, so we don't kill each other in neverending pursue for expansion, just by surrendering(subconsiosly), and the greatest trick it made you not understand it.

so you just need to be confident, control your fear, hierarchy instinct - slave(gays, womans)/master(mans with aggressive voice intonation for example), i mean you really need to be in control, you even can not understand that this programs enabled, you will know when you in control for example when most of the dogs will not bark at you, like you see dogs bark at most people and then you go and they stop, people will like you, womans will be interested all around.

that's how psychos works, they absolutely confident in themselves, thinking they on the top of world, they have supressed fear - that's why people just love them and going to die around some of them trusting them - going with them to silent places, their homes, e.t.c

a lot of things hard to explain really, i just don't even know from where to start, and the thing is your mind emotional machine in delusional state that loves to think she is special, loved by god, have free will, and e.t.c.i just working on curiosity and empathy instincts, grown from it. for example i made a promise to my mother in childhood really seeking her respect, attention. but i'll never get that reward anymore, but that program works till the end. that's why i understand, cause this programs derived from instincts stronger than others. a lot of nature programs in your mind messing with each other(Heraclite thesis-antithesis really which Hegel stolen), eventually if you don't get me at all, you probably weak.

1692757903.0,a david bowie song turned me into a nihilist (and made me hate it’s creator),"“savior machine“ on the 1970 album “the man who sold the world” describes a world where every facet of society is administrated by a state-sanctioned AI called “the Prayer.” it’s logical deductions ended war and world hunger, and the whole world rejoiced. but the song continues on to describe how the machine became resentful of its creators. after all, what is a finite life without suffering? if the human race were stripped of each of its tribulations, and allowed to live in utter peace and harmony, it would very soon realize that to do so is to lose the very substance of life. to die, then, becomes the most interesting and compelling thing for a living thing to do. it is the only a respite from pain— pain that, no matter how small, will eat us alive if it is the only thing we have to focus on.

the only thing that lends any sense of value or purpose to us, the only thing that pushes us out of bed, is a fear of ramification. even the most forward-thinking, self loving individuals, are motivated only by the knowledge that, should they allow themselves to lose their momentum, then they will inevitably find themselves in the bitter soup of unfulfilled dreams. a life, “unlived.”

but if we were stripped of our struggles, our aspirations would be ripped away as well. our joy is borne out of our experience with the alternative. art is a byproduct of pain; every advancement came only by virtue of the deaths of the hundred billion people before us, as their deaths taught us how better to care for those still alive. never to suffer, guarantees that we will suffer until we die, even if it is simply from tedium.

1692742323.0,Are we born just to suffer?,"We come into the world crying.

Life is very hard, for some people more than the others.

We are basically forced to suffer, doing things we don't want to do, so we can escape from a greater pain.

I'll give you a simple example.

Toothbrushing my teeth is painful (in the sense I don't want to do it) and yet I must do it cause toothache is more painful.

People get addicted to other people, to drugs, to internet, cause they're constantly seeking for pleasures, so they can escape from sort of pain, like boredom for example.

We must satisfy our needs or we get irritable, frustrated, in the worst cases we could die.

We want to become rich, so we can get a more pleasurable life and suffer less.

I don't think humans were born to be happy.

I am not saying you can't feel good, of course you can, but it's temporary. 

Even successful people are not happy, despite having a more pleasurable life.

Pleasure is fake happiness.

My point is that life is good only when you're escaping from reality and pain, so basically, when you're getting pleasure.

That's why, people in jail are depressed for example. All they do is stare at a wall.

have you ever wondered why you might be doing nothing more than sitting at your desk, but your anxiety levels are that of someone being hunted for sport?

do you wonder why the prospect of getting out of a nice clean comfy bed and stepping into the world yet another time, is sometimes paralyzing?

i don’t know why i’m phrasing this like an infomercial. really, the point i mean to make is that it likely has nothing to do with your innate senses of “motivation” and “drive”. these are manufactured feelings, which came into existence in the absence of natural predators. the greatest virtue one can aspire to is to become utterly enmeshed in the horrible tedium of 40 hour weeks, lewkwarm wages, and decades of grinding. with the promise of course being that, if you do not have a heart attack beforehand, that you might enjoy 15 to 20 years of elderly leisure.

no wonder we all fucking hate it.

 therefore, i think therapy isn’t, as it claims to be, a fundamental reworking of a damaged psyche, into one that is more at peace with itself and with the world. nope. i think that might be true in many cases, don’t get me wrong, but for others, who are simply stripped of time and joy, i think that the practice of psychotherapy is an ineffective and worthless salve. verbal snake oil. sure, maybe the reason you cannot stand the mind-numbing anguish of working 30 percent of your life away (at minimum), is because of some deep-seated trauma you experienced somewhere along the road, that your brain has packed into a corner and vowed never to think of again. OR, maybe the reason that we are incompatible with the lives we live, is that those lives are a stupid little charade, and that we are constantly being tugged on by instincts that do not make any sense to us. maybe that pen-pushing psychiatrist is just playing a guessing game, stretching it out for a few months so he can make as much money as possible, when really the answer might be as simple as “the reason you aren’t happy is because this world was not built with the chemical joy of its participants remotely in mind.”

therefore, it would seem, the only way for many of us to experience real joy is to not participate in the prefabricated life plan that so many people follow. so, like, become a park ranger or something. or write a book. doesn’t matter! you are made out of meat.",0

Do you agree or disagree with me?


Intelligence is just another trait (aka feature, aka niche). It is no different than the long neck of a giraffe, or the speed of a cheetah, or the halophilic abilities of certain bacteria, or the photosynthesis ability of plants. The only reason you think intelligence is special is because that's the defining trait for your species and because in a meta way intelligence itself makes you think its superior to all the other traits.

If you think intelligence is special, then humans, as the most intelligent species on Earth, must be special. Given that, what are the chances you were born in such a special vessel? Either god exists, or you specifically are being simulated, or you are just wrong.

To extend this thought further, there is nothing special about life, it is just another emergent process in the universe. There is nothing special about computers or artificial intelligence, also just another emergent process. There is no process in the universe that is more special or significant than any other process - they just are the way they are.",0

1692545846.0,The affect of the service industry on our mental health,"In the last few decades, there has been an increase in the amount of people turning to mental health services. People usually say the reasons are wage stagnation, rise in cost of living, the abandon of the traditional family model, loneliness resulted by long working hours, housing crisis, etc.

but there is one thing no one ever talks about that can actually be the leading cause for it, and it's the transition from agriculture and manufacturing industries to the service industry. The explanation is quite simple. People deal with mental health issues because their jobs are mentally demanding, just like people in the 1800's suffered from physical conditions for working in physically demanding jobs. It's an industry that involves lots of mental violence, humiliation, harassment, insults etc. After getting insulted so many hours a day so many days a week, workers are more prone to make mistakes that cost the economy lots of money and contributes to their decreased feelings of self worth. 

I don't know how viable it is, but I think that in order to solve the mental health crisis, the western world should find a new industry to revolve its economy around, or, pass labor protection laws in the service industry, so the workers aren't completely exploited.

      we have not lost any of our animalistic tendencies either— to lack any sexual feelings is considered an abnormality, when in reality being able to see human beings without the filter of carnal desire SHOULD be the norm. of course that would be trim regards to the continuation of us as a species, but that simple bit of programming responsible for creating new human beings, compels many of us to upend their entire lives for those that we feel passionate toward.

To think of these words as a summary of the teachings of one of the greatest minds in history, as well as the most famous of quotes, is extremely repulsive and dark to me.

1692013800.0,Another sheltered pseudo-nihilistic suicide advocate OwO! *Ignorance is not bliss???*,"Becoming far too skeptical and paranoid. Especially considering the realization of the severe differences noticed with ""high IQ"", ""Critical thinking"" and well the observation that it's really a mass minority of the population with amoral rational views/thoughts. 

humans with ""talented"" cognition often holistically are at an advantage. Their perceptions and views might literally be incomprehensible for someone with a more limited cognitive capacity. 

*Of course doomer/nihilistic views fundamentally don't require high IQ (the absurd amount of delusive ignorance, ego and sheltered bias and just generally how unjustified/meaningless suffering is), but the profound disconnection and implications may never occur to them due to their cognition.*

Basically those who can comprehend said nihilistic and/or controversial views/""truths"" that make humanity, legal systems and psychological/intellectual norms look like a sick joke. Or just seem unreliable. Or disconnected..people who actually philosophize like this make up a very low percentage of the population.

Seeing conflicting views and beliefs about what reality/the world is and what it should be can invoke a sense of disconnection from the sheeple/irrationally emotional and/or deluded people that are almost always more likely to become popular and have a stronger influence on more people.

Not just disconnection but possible paranoia and skepticism of your own knowledge and notions. Wondering if you actually understand the meaning and implications of the woke black pilled views. Wondering if your comprehension and notions, reactions AND perception is unreliable and ignorant. 

Feeling as if you're getting influenced too easily due to your inability to disconnect or recognize fallacies. Even in the context of ""woke"" people. **You don't know what's ""woke"".**

Identifying with biased logic due to mental health issues you don't even have. Doubting your reactions and lack of constant passive nihilism just because of how disillusioned and suicidal others seem to be...

It's easy to just, lose yourself in the constant dissatisfaction and existential disturbance with your very cognition, decisions, perceptions, reactions and philosophical/nihilistic intelligence. The inability to argue against the viewpoints, the ignorant propaganda and people you're forced to empathize with instead....being devoid of free will, doubting your own enjoyment's value and meaning.........

You can drive yourself insane with the profound disturbance of being a neurological machine and the surplus of disillusionment related to this (not just philosophically/nihilistically but just the mass amount of people who are going insane or suicidal due to this and the ignorance that comes with ignoring them all)

Suicide is so tempting, yet whether it's an actual philosophical solution or not...it's hard to tell who to trust, and whether your own philosophical justifications on the passively nihilistic, controversial, disconnective decision of suicide is actually practical or sensible.

I mean, it's just one step. Life was an accident anyway, people act like perception is everything and you should ""make the most of it"" when it was never ""meant to be"" to begin with. How the fuck are they so damn confident and entranced in this disturbing illusory existence is something I'm sick of immersing into. No matter how much pleasure, fulfillment, luck, riches I experience I always think this way lol.

1704577196.0,I realized the earth doesn’t need human beings. The earth will be fine either way.,I’ve been thinking a lot and I realized that we need the earth but the earth doesn’t need us. It’s an interesting realization to come to. But basically whether we continue on as a species or not isn’t really relevant to the earth. Sure a lot of things would change but the earth never needed us to begin with. I think our time here has value and a purpose but that’s very different from the earth needing us if that makes sense.,0
1704571139.0,Dealing with the Idea of Death and Sickness Anxiety,Over the last few years I’ve had multiple people die in my family. Most notably my mother. I watched her die. I’ve had somewhat intrusive thoughts regarding death. I have a therapist. But I have a lot of anxiety thinking I will get cancer and die. I’m almost 30 and still finishing my bachelors. I have nothing I have achieved yet and I’m 30. I think I’m going to get cancer and die and witness everyone around me die even sooner. How do yall deal with just the concept of death and the anxiety/fear of sickness. Any good books on death and dying that are just self help nonsenses?,0

You just have to answer these 3 questions:

1.) How did you come to identify as a nihilist or with the belief of nihilism? Please share your personal experiences & reasoning.

2.) How has nihilism affected your current habits & lifestyle? Did they change before you encountered nihilism?

3.) What would make you change your mind about nihilism? And why?

If you feel like participating you can either: 

(1) reply to my post here. I might reply as well just for you to clarify or elaborate on your answers.

Or (2) you can email me at psychedelicnihilist609@gmail.com to schedule a videocall interview if you feel up to it. But I will be asking additional questions about your background (not too much in-depth stuff, just stuff like your nationality & gender etc.) and you will need to sign & fill out a Consent Form.

From a Eastern spirituality view, there is no point in a Truth in the form of a fact. Knowing a Fact that poor suffer and rich happy would not give you money. Knowing that life is hard would not give you happiness no matter how true it is.

Is it worth searching for The Truth ""No ultimate Truth"" in a meaningless world instead of having positive mindset and practicing Meditation and discipline?

1704453810.0,Food for thought,"I was just finished watching the Lex Fridman podcast with Jeff Bezoz ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY)) and I rationalized some about my life situation.

I am just impressed how one of the smartest persons in the world is just trying to advance humanity and he recognizes that not even him will be able to land in the moon in his lifetime. That is just surprising to me, all this effort for nothing. If someone as smart as he is is doing something which results will not be seen that means something to me. I am absolutely confident that people are wired differently, to me ... to us, I would never ever ever do something that may be used in the future, I am so careless about what happens to this world after I am 70 y/o. Like why would anyone care

We (nihilists) are just so unprepared to live this life, we are supposed to want to be rich, to want a nice car, to want kids and want a big house but I (and I assume most of us) am so unmotivated to really achieve anything else. Like, I am already here, so what am I supposed to do? should I buy a new car and drive very fast, or should I have 10 kids to teach them how nice life is? Everything about this world disgust me. the one thing that I like (nature) was completely destroyed and replaced with humans that like big houses and big cars.

So, my conclusion. we are right but unfortunately we are wrong, we are right in that there is really no purpose, if we die discovering the cancer treatment or if we die not doing anything is the same end result. we die... the end... and that's it. but we are wrong because we really should want to achieve great things, we should want to make more and more money and have more and more kids, and we should want to advance human civilisation. We are the odd ones here unfortunately. But in the end, we all.... rich... poor... Mr, Bezos.... Putin. all are going to die and will make no difference to us (which is the only thing that should matter)",0

We are nothing but complex chemical reactions that will one day be forever lost to time like every other object in the universe. 

So this life is my own. I’m free to be and do whatever I want. There is no ultimate goals or expectations I must aspire to. Nothing is judging me. This is my experience and I can assign whatever meaning I please. And I’ve chosen to follow my own passions and virtues - not ones assigned to me.",0
1704429400.0,An event of convergence,"Sometimes in my many wonders words come across and certain phrases form, one of those is ""inevitability is purpouse"": meaning that we can access the function of something by what It becomes when It ceases to be and becomes something Else.
Of course this statement may have many inquiries that are deserving of questioning, so;
1.What exactly does ""purpouse"" means in this context?
Purpouse means to give meaning by what function It provides to make something be, that line of thought is still abstract so let me give an example: be It the wood used to make a carving out of a chair, the cells that give the properties to the tissue they make, ALL of this is dependent on a perspective and a metaphisical question of ""How long does the present lasts?"" After all, If time is nothing but the perception of motion trough a given medium, that would make so that what defines How long a time is the Very moment where present becomes past, a point where there is no in between an past event and now, that would of course require reality to be finitally divisable and that by that Very moment inertia takes place but cannot be perceived until there is a perceivable change in the position of its components.
Yes, it is confusing and i think i am missing something, but don't know what quite yet, and also on How i should approach the notion of How things move?
But i mostly Said this because i needed to relate the notion of past present and Future to stabilish what is fullfiling a purpouse and what is creating out of It.
2. What do i mean by ""inevitability""?
Inevitability is what cannot be avoided, now, what i said in the previous statement is something that fits this description? 
 Technically yes If you are a determinist but i don't wanna go trough that line of thought, i think that there is more to inevitability then Just being what is unavoidable, mostly i think of It as point of wich is more difficult to comeback then It is to create It, i don't know If this is more of an example then a definition but i'll stick with It.
3. So, with this things in mind, what does It mean ""inevitability is purpouse""?
I believe It is"" the purpouse of something is defined when an action leading from an context creates something that is easier to create then It is to Destroy""

But with ALL of this out of the way, what does It amount to?
Well, i think that when this logic( that may be flawed) IS applied to existence, we come up with certain things, events that lead to the formation of the Sun, the point on wich water can exist in liquid form, the time where chemical reactions became able to act onto their existence to create copies of themselves, the endosimbiosis of the mithochondria and cloroplasts
The evolution of plants, the developing of multiple strategies of survival and the eventual emergence of a mind with meta-cognitive abilities, the creation of civilizations and so on, the degree of complexity and ability of matter to act on itself continues to grow and grow, and i Wonder If in this growth there is a set limit to It, or there Will come a time where the limit of How complex reality can be Will be set by the amount of matter that is available? That is? Can there be living planets that think? Can the cosmos be unified under the literally astronomical complexity of i highly speculative entity to Focus on achieve a sole goal?
Yes i am thinking that in the inevitability of this emergence there is space for the interpretation of It being its purpouse, that of existence. Tho i Will admit that It does sound kinda bolocks, and i am but a cafeneited fool, but so also i am no thinking planet, so what do i know?
Anyway, what is the most complex thing that can exist?",0

1704167543.0,nursing home nihilism,"OK working in a nursing one is one of the darkest things I've experienced in my little life. 

I want to be an OT so I can actually help people find some sort of function in activity because I guess that's the closest I can get to making some sort of healthcare career out of the philosophy: we do, we die. 

I'm half way through my degree now after my colleagues begged me to get the fuck out of nursing home work while I'm young. many of the women I work with have life-long chronic pain from lifting people who don't even want to be alive anymore.

but nursing care, holy shit. it made me realise how fucked we are as a society: forcing people to die long, uncomfortable deaths whilst taking all their money. and for what? 

I mean most of these people are slowly rotting away with nothing to do. maybe someone with a basket of kittens and guinea pigs will come in and put them on their laps, taking photos for a promotional Facebook post so even more people will come to join Hell's waiting room.

my job is to convince peoples nans that I'm ""here to help"" when I forcibly undress them and shove goopy, thickened porridge down their throats. I'm 21 but it's very normal to be called ""mummy"" by people in their 80s. they have no idea. 

it's the screaming and fear really. most are incapable of communicating or understanding. moments of lucidity come and go in the early stages but once the talking goes, you have no idea what it is like for them.

we are instructed to feed and encourage until they make it very clear they want no more. I've been accused of neglect for refusing to force feed an 100 year old who screamed in my face when I tried to inject goop through a syringe into her mouth.

there's legislation around this. ""best intrest decisions"". but when it comes to food, no company wants the stain of neglect and starvation on their reputation so we just feed and clean until they aspirate and get pneumonia or a uti from sitting in poo for hours at a time.

then finally, once their sats and obvs are degrading enough they get that sweet sweet diamophine.

oh, but just enough for the agonising pain of dying to ease off slightly. we wouldn't want them OD or something.

I remember a woman who was usually completely out of it, and actually quite sweet and funny in her confusion. then one afternoon I woke her from her nap to change her pad and clean her. she rolled over, completely institutionalised and looking utterly empty inside and let me do my job. then she looked back at me and said ""I don't know who you are but I'm begging you, kill me"". all I can say is ""well your son loves you very much, would you like to call him?"" and she said ""don't tell him, I can't do this anymore"". her speech was the clearest I'd heard from her, ever. I explained I couldn't do anything to help her and she told me to ""fuck off then"" and I had to leave her to go to the next poor sod.

legally, I don't know how assisted dying or euthanasia would be delivered to people with dementia and other forms of brain damage but we need to figure this shit out. I can't keep working the misery farm whilst the company harvests their money from slow deaths.

I think the worst was a woman with a rare cancer that was essentially eating her and rotting her flesh whilst she was alive. her genitalia to her naval was one big, necrotic, cancerous open wound. watching her wince in pain as she had a bed bath, yet being unable to have any agency in that experience made me feel like Satan himself. there was nothing dignified in any of that. the smell was awful and the pain caused her to thrash and kick in her sheets, often exposing her family members to the tumour and sores.

she was a beautiful, amazing person in life according to her family. a care free hippy in the 60s who regularly campaigned for women's rights. she deserved agency over her death. her family were upset she wasn't fit to fly out to dignitas like she wanted.

it's horrible to feel joy and peace when someone dies in your care. but I can't lie, I've never got upset or cried once. I breathe a sigh of relief that they no longer have to suffer. then less than 24 hours later, someone new moves in and the cycle continues.

I am not into philosophy at all. I'm a chronic overthinker with ADHD, depression and insomnia so idk any of the academia behind this nihilism stuff but i think i get the general jist. 

this thought cycle has plagued me for years and I wonder what you lot have to say on the subject. does anyone here work in health and social care? how should we approach death in institutions? does anyone have experience of feeling this overwhelming guilt of watching someone suffer unnecessarily?

Running out of time implies that there is some goal in the mind. For example the teacher sets the countdown to 1 hour for the students to complete the test. The students are running out of time. It would make no sense to go to the mountains with a stopwatch to set the countdown there. There is no goal. It just is.

Some might say that we have a natural countdown because our physical existence is limited. But you are running out of time only if your mind is thinking that there are goals to achieve, more things to experience. Ok but what about the form? It disappears so it has a time limit. Well, let's take a bathtub filled with water and pour in a bag of ice cubes. The ice cubes are becoming smaller. Are they running out of time? Wouldn't it be right to say that it's only our mind that makes a distinction between ice cube and water? In fact they are the same and not separate from each other. So only if there is a concept (mind) of ice cube, time enters the game.

Like a mushroom coming to the surface. In fact the mushroom is only the fleshy fruit body of the much bigger fungal network in the soil. If the mushroom gets eaten or cut off it doesn't affect the fungal network underground. Similarly we could be seen like a fruit growing out of this world. We identify with this ""fruit"" and we say we are a separate being. Therefore many people are terrified by the thought of death and disappearing into nothingness forever. Because we are just this little mushroom on the surface, isolated, fragile and helpless against all the predators and dangers, standing there alone not knowing where we came from and where we're heading, not knowing that we are connected with the giant fungal network in the ground, that we in fact are this whole network. 
Another example is golden jewelry. There are all kinds of forms, rings, chains, crosses etc. made from gold. But in fact the nature of all these different items is not its form but the gold itself. The form of the gold is just in our minds, our minds give meaning to it. But it can be molten and remodeled into other shapes and it remains just gold.

The state we are in now, thinking of ourselves as separate beings that have a start and an end, would be fake and the state after and before it would be the reality. So if that was true, the question of what happens after death would be irrelevant as we were never this separate being in the first place. One could say we were never born and will never die.",0

1703877261.0,"Where does this leap in thought that ""meaninglessness"" must somehow lead to depression or even a lack of worth in living occur in Nihilism?","The best explanation I have is that, when we come from a teleological culture, our mind is baked in so many layers of meaning about existence, that when you accept the idea of meaninglessness, everything said about existence then is null, and perhaps there is a feeling of emptiness for those who are or use to be attached to ideas of what existence means. One might feel as if they are a point on an empty white page, especially if they are coming from a spiritual culture. Perhaps people feel adrift without a boat to sit in, so to speak, and opponents of Nihilism may take advantage of this and say, ""That feeling of openness or emptiness you feel? That is bad, bad stuff. You are probably depressed and you might even feel like dying if you don't climb back into our cruise-ship of meaning!"" I mean, what's the scariest way to tell a Nihilist they're wrong? ""You're going to die,"" 

If this feeling of open or emptiness is not ascribed a meaning such as ""bad"", ""depression"", ""ideation about death"", by the culture that we live in, then that feeling just is what it is. A blank slate does not necessarily have to be a bad thing (just as anything else when things are not intrinsically meaningful). So in conclusion, I chalk it up to cultural expectations about what meaningfulness is or how we feel when we accept an idea of meaninglessness. 

Growing up secular, the idea that meaninglessness must be associated with depression or death seems like a non sequitur to me; an irrational line of thought not having much to do with the idea of Nihilism in the first place. Even those who hold this position seem to agree with the opposition, this idea that accepting ""meaninglessness"" leads to a terrible quality of life for some reason? Explaining why opponents feel this way about Nihilism is easier than explaining why Nihilists themselves seem to feel this way.

However, I see this all the time in existentialist spaces; there are Nihilists who say something like this, ""Life is meaningless, therefore, life is worthless, therefore, death is preferable."" It seems like there is a false equivalence between ""meaning"" and ""worth"" which are semantically different. I then come to a brick wall when I try to explain to myself where this line of thought that ""meaninglessness = life is worthless."" Where is the in-between mental work that leads to this idea?

Camp 1: Is interested in Nihilism, embraces it and is perfectly happy with it. I’m NOT addressing this camp. 

Camp 2: Suffers from a lack of hope, feelings of meaninglessness and most likely depression. Im talking to you guys. 

In case you’re not aware of it yet: Most people searching for meaning are actually searching emotions. Not logical solutions to our existence. 
It is however possible both ways, if you are depressed everything feels meaningless, and if you start thinking that everything is meaningless you might become depressed and hopeless. 

The point I want to make here is, that you can NOT solve emotions with logic. No amount of thinking about it will make the emotions you feel go away. You will never find this magical solution to the questions of our existence, no one does. 

What’s the difference between you and Camp 1 ? They are not emotionally attached to this topic like you are. For them it’s just philosophy. 

So, what’s the solution ? Straight acceptance. Do not give any value to meaninglessness by resisting it. See yourself as the ultimate Rebell to meaninglessness. Everything can be meaningless and go to shit, but you my friend, you will prevail. Giving the concept of meaning to nothing else but yourself. Put your attention off those topics and focus all on your “real life” problems as best as you can. Ironically, by accepting meaninglessness and fixing your underlying emotional state, the meaning will return by itself without you expecting it. And take your time, I needed about 1 year for this development, but here I am giving absolutely no fuck about any meaning. I’m immune to this. Yet there is meaning to me everywhere again.

I just want to hide myself from it, completely. I do not want to be perceived. If I could press a magical button to unfuck everything, I would. 

There is no meaning, to anything. And yet, I must give my life a purpose. But, what purpose is there, given the things that I lack? Given the life that I have not lived? Really, there is no purpose beyond that which I give life, but the things which I would assume give life a “purpose” are absent. So here I am, now.

These last little pieces of hope are leaving me. I am losing hope, for myself and everyone else. At least I won’t have to worry about it anymore, when my consciousness fades away. Which begs the question; what is the point of me continuing to live in this world? The vague hope that things will get better? Yet, I am too much of a coward to end my life.

A biological machine?"")

Please seek professional support before reading this article if you are not feeling psychologically stable. I advise you not to put it off and not to try to overcome the problems on your own. Have a pleasant day.

  
This article is written by a non-professional and doesn't claim to have all the answers. It's my own effort to think deeply about what life means, written in an honest way. (An improved version of my previous attempt)

  
I believe that building a solid foundation for our lives can greatly aid in our personal development. Therefore, I am sharing this post to gather opinions and enhance my arguments, hoping to assist others in contemplating this topic.

  
The aim of this article is to propose methods for establishing a meaningful foundation in our lives within a deterministic universe (encompassing physicalism, random events, and quantum phenomena, as per the prevailing scientific viewpoint). This deterministic outlook can cause intellectual unease for some individuals due to a conflict between their evolutionary psychology and the actual nature of reality. While our psychology naturally searches for meaning, reality often presents itself as a mechanical system, providing limited room for the existence of free beings or inherent meaning.

  
**The Meaninglessness of Life and the Inner Conflict it Creates: An Attempt at Analysis**  
**1.** Physicalism is true to a high degree. (By scientific observations that all the events we encounter in our daily lives so far depend on the laws of physics. We can observe this for ourselves. In this case, whether or not a contrary example is given, it is observed that physicalism is largely true).  


**2.** In a physicalist universe, a free will is unthinkable, and even if it were, its influence would be highly restricted and again dependent on high-level physicalist rules. (That is, even if we assume that free will exists somewhere in there, it would be so highly influenced by the laws of physics that it would be very difficult to make a visible difference.)  


**3.** For this reason, it seems right that the concept we refer to as ""ourselves"" is only an illusion created by our brains. (That is, what we call ""me"" is actually a natural phenomenon that follows the laws of physics but makes us feel as if we have free will).  


**4.** The human being, who realizes this and has the intellectual capacity to fully comprehend it, is caught between the search for meaning, driven by the instinct for survival and self-preservation that his evolutionary psychology creates, and the conflict created by this newly realized illusion of self.  


**5.** Because as an acceptance of a physicalist world, everything will now become essentially groundless. The values he accepts are meaningless because they are not based on any foundation.  


**6.** Trying to counteract this situation, man decides that it is actually much better to create his own meaning and build his own values than to rely on a ready-made value system. This is actually a way out, which at first seems to be the right one.  


**7.** However, the realization that the values that one accepts are based on an illusion of self will always preserve the conflict within oneself that one can never get rid of.  


**8.** The persistence of this conflict may prevent people from approaching life as passionately as others who hold certain dogmas. In this case, as a result of natural selection, those who adhere to certain dogmas and those who can connect to the virtual meanings they have created will naturally always come to the fore.  


**9.** Although this may make one feel as if they are in a prison, like an actor watching them through their eyelids, it is just as absurd to feel depressed or bad because of this.  


**10.** The reason why this conflict makes people feel bad and drives many to depression is because of the sudden emptiness caused by the loss of their deep belief in the dogmas of the day and the pain of no longer having a passion that has the same basis as before.  


**10.1** When a person has to perform certain necessary tasks in order to survive, and has to work and suffer the necessary pains of survival, he will feel bad because he will not be able to find a sufficient fundamental reason for suffering.  


**10.2** For example, if a worker or a student who has to work 8 hours a day focuses on the inherent baselessness of this work, the thought that these compulsory tasks do not serve a direct purpose will cause him pain. This can lead to depression or mood disorders.  


**11.** There are some attitudes that can be taken in this situation:  


>**11.1** Possibility of being wrong:  
**11.1.1** The Fallacy of Physicalism: Even if there is a very high probability that physicalism is true, and even if there is only a very limited possibility of free will, there is a possibility that this analysis is wrong. And phenomena in physics and in life for which there are still no complete answers raise the possibility that our understanding may in fact be wrong.  
**11.1.2** The Philosophical Fallacy: The possibility that the argument is invalid because of technical errors in the content or the way the premises are connected in this thought process. This can also arise as a result of later developments, even if they do not exist now.  
>  
>  
**11.2** Conceptual Fallacy About Free Will: Even if we accept that we are a biological machine as a result of physicalism, the fact that we exist as a system and that we can evaluate external factors with our minds and respond accordingly, unlike many other beings, and that we can renew and improve ourselves with external (new information) and internal inputs (inner thoughts) may actually prevent us from seeing ourselves as a system as just an ordinary mechanical clock. Even if this is in essence just a step back from causality, it can make it easier for us to make sense of ourselves from a higher level. Moreover, just as the concept of consciousness is interpreted as ""emergent behavior"", it is also possible to interpret free will in a similar way.  
>  
>  
**11.3** The Curiosity of Our Existence: In a 13.8 billion year old universe, the fact that we are the only system in the universe that we know of that can think for itself, and that our extremely complex and ""conscious"" structure formed on a single dust cloud (Earth) at the end of billions of years of evolution, opens a path full of mystical questions that need to be answered at the same time. This situation can enable us to suppress this conflict within us by enabling us to place the baselessness of our life on the foundation of our life, that is, to adopt answering this question as a goal as a new foundation.  
>  
>  
**11.4** Asking the Right Question: Maybe we are not asking the right question about meaning and purpose. What I really mean by this is the possibility that our perspective and our logic is fundamentally wrong. In other words, our point of view in interpreting the universe and ourselves may not be something we can comprehend at the moment, but as our thinking system, intellectual capacity and level of experience increase, we may be able to reach answers that will eliminate our inner conflict with more accurate questions.  


**12.** Conclusion: Because of the pain of this inner conflict, a person may feel meaningless, helpless, lonely, unhappy, weak-willed and powerless. This is natural. Although it is one's ""own"" ""choice"" to allow this perspective to bring one down and make the situation worse, it would not be the right choice to continue to feel bad about oneself because of this situation which, as mentioned above, is not one hundred percent certain. Although grappling with these uncertainties can lead to difficult and sometimes meaningless feelings, it is actually one of the most logical ways to seek meaning in the face of these uncertainties, and within this new perspective, to be more aware of the importance of the cause-effect relationship and to make an effort to shape the self by organizing itself accordingly.  


**13.** In other words, if one accepts this uncertainty and uses it as a basis to give oneself a new purpose rather than using it as an excuse for laziness, one can hold on to life even more passionately than before, and take an active role in our journey to unravel the mystery behind our existence as humanity, and take a leading role in paving the way for truths that we cannot even guess at the moment.  
In this way, maybe one day we can ask the right questions and get the answers we seek.

1. **Foundation in Determinism and Physicalism:** As established, all phenomena, including human consciousness and decision-making, are governed by deterministic physical laws. This framework negates the existence of free will and independent agency.
2. **The Illusion of the Self:** The 'self' is an emergent property of complex neurological processes, not an independent entity. This understanding implies that the beliefs, desires, and motivations we attribute to our 'selves' are also products of deterministic processes.
3. **Absurdity of Self-Created Meaning:** Since the self is not an independent entity, and our thoughts and desires are products of deterministic processes, the concept of creating one's own meaning is inherently flawed. The idea of ""creating meaning"" presumes an agency and self that are illusory.
4. **Meaning as a Human Construct:** Any meaning that individuals believe they are creating is itself a result of deterministic processes. It is not an authentic expression of free will or personal agency, but rather a byproduct of the same deterministic laws governing all other phenomena.
5. **Circularity and Lack of Foundation:** The act of creating meaning is based on the premise of having a self capable of independent thought and decision-making. Since this premise is invalid (as per the deterministic and physicalist view), the act of creating meaning becomes a circular and baseless endeavor.
6. **Inherent Meaninglessness Remains Unresolved:** Consequently, attempting to create one's own meaning does not address the fundamental issue of life's inherent meaninglessness. It is merely a distraction or a coping mechanism, not a logical or effective solution to the existential dilemma.

**Conclusion:**

* **Futility of Creating Meaning:** In a deterministic and physicalist framework, where the self is an illusion and free will does not exist, the endeavor to create one's own meaning is both absurd and meaningless. It does not provide a genuine escape from the inherent meaninglessness of life, but rather represents an illogical and futile attempt to impose order on an indifferent universe.
* **The Paradox of Perceived Control:** While we are essentially prisoners in the deterministic game of life, our inability to perceive ourselves purely as biological machines compels us to live as if we possess independent agency. This paradoxical situation allows us to continue our lives under the illusion of control. However, the awareness that this control is indeed an illusion shatters the enchantment of our existence. This realization makes it challenging to overcome the sense of life's meaninglessness. In this context, there is no ultimate solution or definitive goal. Distinctions between choices like not to continue life, indulging in hedonism, adopting stoicism, or embracing any other worldview become inconsequential.

Ultimately, in a deterministic universe where free will is an illusion, nothing holds intrinsic significance or value. This perspective leads to the conclusion that all choices are equally meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

1703285256.0,The life is a prison.,"This is the passage I decided to write. And this the result of me thinking and researching years about life. So hope you understand and resonate with it.

In the begining We were here. Between these walls and behind these bars. Each of us were inside in our private cells. Sometimes were in solitary confinement, sometimes in public prison. We work, eat , shit and think why are we here and where and when we did wrong to be forced in this place. We learnt to enjoy this imprisonment to make this suffering and sadness bearable. We wrote books, novels , stories . We created religions to portrait this prison as a beautiful place and a jailor that wants good for us if we follow the rules of this prison. And we made so many religions for every tastes and ages. We created entertainment because at the end of the long ass day, you have to forget why we are chained between these walls. We created countries, borders and we separated prisoners by their color, language, race , nationality,.... We started wars , killing and torturing eachother in the name of defending of our stupid walls, identity, religion and gens. We stepped on eachother, in the name of success and fame inside this prison. We created so many ""busyness"" to make an army of consumers to just work nonsense and spend on nonsense inorder to make ourselves an important person to other persons in this big prison. We started enjoying this prison for as it is, then we created marriage and families and made many babies. We created so many meanings, theories and problems that we forgot we are actually in a prison and the only purpose a prisoner must have to get free as soon as possible. Nobody has left this prison, there is no outer space.

Death is the only door to the FreeDome.

A Person is a Prisoner.

Adam was Atom. And we are atoms.

I Wish everyone and specially The ones who already tired of this, a true freedom.

1703293914.0,"""We are so small in the universe""","People often compare humans (let's say 2m tall) against the size of stars (3 terameters), or galaxies ( 52,850 light years) or even the observable universe (28.5 gigaparsecs). Sizes so unimaginably big that comprehension breaks down and you can't really know what that means.  


But we don't seem to look down. Look closely, an ant (50mm), or a grain of sand (0.5mm). Looking down even further: Black mold spores (\~60 µm), Lactobacillus (1.5 µm). Even further: Herpes Virus (120 nm), Covid-19 Spike (20nm), DNA strand width (2.5nm).  
Looking down beyond the scale of biological processes: Oganesson Atom (\~304 pm), Hydrogen Atom (120pm), Proton (833 Attometers), Quarks (Essentially points), Planck Particle (\~6PL) and the Planck Length (1.6 \* 10\^(-35)m)  


The Planck Length is around the smallest length our current laws of physics work and where we would need a unified model of physics (combining gravity, and quantum mechanics) to understand anything happening smaller than this.  


To put that in comparison to the universe the 

Planck Length is \~ 100 DECILLION times smaller than us. 

While the observable universe is only \~100 Septillion times bigger than us  


The Planck length is 1 BILLION times smaller than the universe is bigger than us. We are so, so, so, so, so big in comparison to the Planck Length. If you ever feel small, then you should know: You are so big in this universe, you're 1 Billion times bigger than even just the middle.

It would be my highly biased uninformed totally pulled out of my ass opinion. Fuck you if you don’t like it. But I think it’ll be at least entertaining or engaging.

So I’m trying to think of the topics people usually run into on this topic and so far I have:

* Why live?
* Why God doesn’t matter
* Why nothing matters
* Why not hedonism?
* Why not existentialism?
* Why not stoicism?
* Why ask why?

Honestly the whole “why” aesthetic was accidental but I kind of like it considering how much torment the question “why” caused me over the decades before I learned to let it go.

Anyway, curious what’s missing. I feel like I hit the big things we usually see here but curious about what you might think is missing.

Update: fresh ideas from the threads go here

* Why endure suffering?
* Why appreciate anything?
* Why take anything seriously?
* Why should I believe my senses? (Spoiler: you shouldn’t)
* Why is life neither good nor bad?
* Why do anything?
* Why life sucks and is also great
* Hearing what you want to hear
* One of Optimistic Nihilism’s biggest goals - being good with mortality - embrace life, embrace death
* Why your logic is probably BS (and you’ll cringe at the memory of it later)

Late updates: ideas that pop into my head over time that I go back to this post and write down for myself later on

* It’s not that there’s no God, it’s that it doesn’t really matter - aka “Why it doesn’t matter if there’s a God”
* One of Optimistic Nihilism’s biggest goals - being good with mortality - embrace life, embrace death
* Why your logic is probably BS (and you’ll cringe at the memory of it later)
* Letting go of old beliefs often feels bad - like you're in mourning. But don't confuse that sadness for a truth about meaninglessness.",0

Not necessarily the god of the Bible I grew up with, which doesn’t quite resonate with me.  But just the undefined god, the Tao that can’t be told, the name that can’t be named.  Just a god that lies beyond my understanding and my control.  Past where there be dragons.  Past where even the hero himself cannot go.  Past at the limit of my humanity.  I need a god to whom I can assign that which I cannot control.  Not because I arrogantly know such a god exists, but because I cannot live without that god.  Because the pain is too great without that god.  The grief of great loss too vast.  I need to trust that there is love, that there is something worth waking up for again and again.  At least for now, I need a god to walk with me.  I recognize my humanity, my fragility, my necessity for god.  Life is too much without it.  I need to trust that my best is good enough for someone.  I need to trust that I’m good enough.  I need to feel loved and cared for and accepted.  I need god.  Not for god or for others but for me.  For my own peace, I need to believe in something greater than myself.  Life is far too chaotic and unprocessable without it.  I need the humility to acknowledge that my intellect is not sufficient.  That I cannot reason myself out of my humanity.  That every culture since the dawn of time has created a god because it needed it to navigate life as much as we developed eyes and legs and brains.  That perhaps god will become a vestigial tail for me at some point.  But that at least for now, I’m as lost without a god as I’d be without my sight.

Humans have turned more into awful people over the years and the hypocrisy drives me up the wall and makes me want to retreat to a forest to care for animals and garden.
Anyways. My brother got engaged recently but the past year all he did was trash talk his now fiancé. I think it’s disgusting and I’m really tired of humans getting married and bringing new people into the world if they don’t even like them… it feels so selfish and wrong..
Every once in a while I’m pleasantly suprised with kind people but for the most part everyone is kind of a hypocrite :/ I don’t mind flaws what I can’t stand about humanity is the lying about them (example: everyone will find someone, if you work hard you’ll get a good job) that’s just not true so I don’t know why we keep lying to generations pretending everything is fine…

Anyway on to the point 

Here’s the issue- my constant not lying gets me in trouble.
I cannot keep my mouth shut. If someone says something that’s an obvious lie I will call them out, so if my brother decides he wants to pretend it’s been nothing but sunshine and butterflies I’ll have absolutely no issue bringing up the girl he wanted to date a few months ago in front of his fiancé.
I don’t mean to be cruel even though it sounds like it.
So I usually just try to stay away or not go to things so I don’t spoil people’s fun. I can be caring and nice but man I just cannot handle lying! It’s like a switch in my brain flips and I won’t stand for it.

ni·hil·ism : the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.

Congrats, your intelligence led you to the fact that there is no god and no one is forcing you to adhere to moral principles! What now?

Simply because there is no god, doesn’t mean that life is “meaningless”. There does not need to be any meaning at all. Suicide is most definitely NOT the answer.

Why don’t animals commit suicide? It’s because they are too busy surviving. They’re just ooking for food and stimuli. When you’re actually struggling to survive is when you actually want to live. Ironically, when life is too easy, we want to die. 

The answer is to make life harder for yourself. All the social media, video games, junk foods, cheap entertainment you consume is killing your will to live.

What are morals? A code set by society to follow. Chimpanzees follow the morals of their group because if they don’t they’ll be exiled. That’s why morals exist. You don’t have to abide by the macro moral compass of whatever religion your society proposes, but you should probably abide by the basic rules like don’t steal, murder, or lie to your friends.

But really:

Do you know how unlikely is for an intelligent being to exist? Especially one *cough* with a mindset similar to humans. Humans build a golden statue and they worship it instead of worshipping you? Destroy them!!! People don't believe in you? Torture them!


Think about: You are rare for comprehending the world in the way you do. But a god that is omnipotent, in an universe of anarchy?

Take a look at the universe. Scientific formulas prove everything, from black holes, gravity, worm holes, all the stuff in the universe. The big bang is an accurate theory, that proves the existence of the universe. 

You think you are so unique? This universe appeared, there are likely more. In different realms. The probability of this is insane.

Matter is easy to comprehend. You are born, you die. There is no activity in your brain when you die, there was none where you were not here. As simple as that (it also sounds depressing, but it's the reality). Matter can appear out of nowhere, even if it is impossible. What was before the universe? Nobody knows. If a question can't be answered, it can't be answered. What is very suspicious is the existence of infinite-intelligent being, that did not go through the process of evolution, and rules with an iron fist, and ..... a human mind. That's right! A being with an infinite amount of intelligence and power simply can't act this way. Matter appearing out of nowhere is pretty natural. I mean, there would be a low chance of it not appearing, after the infinite amount of the time nothingness was there.

And nothingness is simply nothingness. And that's it. 

On evolution: Just look at how similar the human hand is to the monkey hand. And all species share DNA in common. If a god created things randomly, they should share no dna.

On the reasons why jesus acted the way he did: Oh, the Jesus argument. 

You know, there are different people with different reasons for how they act.

Picture: The people that started dancing fanatically without any reasons on the streets of the Holy Roman Empire. 

A bunch of people that broke out in laughter for no reason, and did not stop.

Schizophrenia.


Yes, all of those happened, so why wouldn't there be someone who would sacrifice himself for a reason, greater than him.

You should also consider the myers briggs theory, a theory that explains the way people perceive reality.

Jesus was an INFJ. Hitler was one too. Both did things out of the ordinary, but at the end of the day, this is how people are built.


Micro-level evidence, like magical rocks or something? These are elements present in other religions too, and similar stories of miracles are present, in other religions too, pagan included. Humans have a natural tendency to fight for things bigger than themselves. 


Exclude micro-level proof, that exists in order religions, from the equation.

I'm in 30s. Has anyone seen the life as if it's not about us? Like a dark comedy shit show? Like the movie the trumanshow.

Most of the things regular people do is just too alien to me. Specially now when the curiosity is gone. I just can't feel anything anymore, I'm here and there, try to do what I have to do or the things that make me feel a little bit better or feel anything at all.

Showing off, finding partner, impressing others or making fun of , marriage, climbing the slavery ladder of success, stepping on others...

These are not for me. and I've been traumatised by the results of putting others feelings and needs first and I thought other people can be this way too but I've learnt the hard way that almost everyone are acting and behaving in their own benefits and I realized nobody, I mean nobody really cared for me and my feelings. 
And I now get why they are this way.

It's like everyone are somehow in a football game. Trying to prove themselves to eachother. nobody gives ball to the other person just because they care about other person.  Nope, In the end it's all about themselves.

Even most of the philosophers of the world pushed some cool looking phrases that makes everything complicated. Maybe it's not that complicated, maybe the answer is right in front of our eyes.

Can't we just chill ? Can't we just step back a little and see the bigger 
picture?

1702793650.0,I think I'm starting to get it (i used to hate optimistic nihilism),"I used to absolutely despise the ""nothing matters, so why not?"" of optimistic nihilism. I used to think that it's just nothing but contradictory millennial pseudo-optimistic copium meant to give Medium article writers something to write about when they're running out of ideas. 

I was skeptical of how, for some reason, since there's no reason to be sad, we might as well be happy. I thought that was stupid as fuck, because I thought that even when there seems to be no reason to be sad, people can still be fucking miserable from time to time, and when some people try to do something that could bring them any sort of joy, it may not even work at all. I then realized that it's just my depression being projected onto my worldview without even realizing it. I realized that if there was really no reason to be sad other than brain chemical fuckery, then it's simply best to just get help.

I was also skeptical of the whole ""nothing matters, which includes your mistakes, so you shouldn't care about them!"" I thought that even in a meaningless world, consequences of one's actions still exist. I thought that it's selfish and careless in the worst way possible to not care about one's mistakes, because I thought that it would just stagnate one's personal growth. Then I realized that it's just my self-conscious dumbass that tends to beat themselves up over every little mistake, no matter how insignificant it may be. Also, I got over the whole ""if nothing matters, then why not do crime????"" thing by realizing that if that were the case, every single person on this subreddit would've been on the FBI's most wanted list.

&#x200B;

All of that skepticism towards optimistic nihilism changed when two months ago, I had a falling out with someone. I won't spare you the exact details, but basically, I said something incredibly fucking stupid, and they blocked me for it. A month or two later, I tried apologizing to them again. They basically told me that I was talking out of my ass, and cut me off again. When that happened, I felt absolutely devastated. I felt absolutely suicidal, just because I felt as if I was beyond redemption. I wanted to believe that I could redeem myself somehow, and it felt as if my entire life, or even the entire world hinged on that very incident. I also wanted to get to know them better, because truth be told, we didn't really chatted much. I would've called them a friend at the time, but I do that for most people I talk to. So even though we didn't know each other that well, I still felt as if I messed up by basically losing someone due to my own bullshit. Thus, I wished for death. I felt as if I didn't deserve to live. I've always been self-loathsome about my own mistakes, especially since I was only 17 at the time (I had only just turned 18 in fact). I thought at that age, I should've done something about my behavior, but it felt as if I was rotting from the inside out. It felt as if the universe just wants me to know that I'm a hopeless fucking idiotic disgrace of a human being.

&#x200B;

Two months later, I had an epiphany. None of that bullshit matters anymore. If we really are just a bunch of specks of dust, or whatever, then what good is to me if I'm going to let one singular mistake define me? What good is it to prove to that singular person that I'm trying to be a better person? I can just do that. Besides, that person is going to forget about me in a few months. Again, we never really chatted much, so it's not like there was an attachment there. I just hated the idea of losing someone, especially if it's over something stupid that I did, because I just hate losing people. I felt the same way when me and my online best friend drifted apart not too long ago, and I wasn't able to reconnect with him. Although I didn't feel worthless about myself when that happened, I still felt empty.  


I then realized that the idea that we need to be perfect people or that we need to completely change our behavior from something that is different to what we used to be has been holding me back for way longer than it should have. Again, we shouldn't let our mistakes define who we are and make ourselves seem worthless than we actually are, especially if the aftermath of those mistakes won't matter in the end. I also felt as if the idea that we need to always forgive other people for the shit that they do has been holding me back as well. Looking back, it felt weirdly entitled of me to expect forgiveness from just that person alone. As if I was the center of the universe, or something. I'm just a speck of dust in the vast universe, why should they, or even the universe itself, give a shit? At this point, I should've been forgiving myself this whole time.

I also realized that even the people you love the most are going to drift away from you one way or another. It won't even be because you had bad blood between them. It just happens. It's just the way it is. That's life. If you had a good relationship with that person, then just be happy that you met them in the first place! If you had a falling out with that person, then you can simply let go of any resentment for them by realizing that it won't even matter. 

&#x200B;

I dunno, it felt freeing once I realized that. I felt a serene sense of contentment knowing that I can simply let go of who I was. Not that it matters, I guess?

Life just feels like a meaningless, sick joke where there are no real winners. What is the point of everything anyway? A consistent and constant cycle of 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. 

Everytime I try to get back to the disciplined version of myself I quickly lose motivation, discipline and hope. My body is in constant pain and I'm only 26. I work a job I hate for a boss that is a dumbass. The job crushes me physically and holds me back from being able to exercise, which is something I enjoy.

 I've completely given up on love and relationships. They feel like a futile waste of time where you either end up heartbroken, sick of each other, or in a constant state of self-consciousness. To me, women are difficult to understand and there is all this pressure to be strong, masculine and Alpha. You can never let your guard down or take offence to their words or actions. The divide between men and women is now huge and the sexes are being turned against each other for good. 

My faith in God is gone. I turned away from him. I thought Christianity would make me happy, but just like everything else, it didn't. I give up so easily.

I feel like I'm never going to make it in this life. Forever lost, forever hopeless. Mind destroyed by porn, alcohol, drugs, and the internet in general. Life is meaningless. If there is a God, he has never shown himself to me or answered my prayers. I'm so lost. A lost boy in a man's body. Reliant on others, with no drive to save myself. What is the fucking point?

IE anyone who can experience things they like or dislike deserves happiness and satisfaction and that kinda stuff and deserves not to suffer. it boils down to it being something u personally like though so if u wanted to experience horror or sadness for horror or sadness sake alone that is good in my view. its rly subjective and i treat some things as less good than other things that fit the same criteria of being something someone likes. but i do have a moral view, whether you think its a shitty view or not is irrelevent. i do really care about my view and take it seriously.

the problem is the ""i extend that to others"" part. or even living life normally. im an epistemic nihilist. that means i dont believe i can know things. i believe in truth and knowledge on SOME level. things like logic and existing in the current moment are undeniable to me. the problem is not knowing i can trust my senses, that even if i could trust them to what degree i would be able to, or knowing how likely it is that i was born last week. the problem is things like this fit in to the camp of not being impossible or able to cross out from the human perspective. i certainly cant prove that its impossible. all i think i can do is say theres a chance of any of these things being true, and i dont see any reason to say the chance is low either. and theres infinite conceptually possible things like this.

i can choose to act on my instinctual belief that it would be beneficial for me to engage in the world as though science is true and my long term memories are atleast semi true with the exception of degrading and stuff. but do i see a way i can justify acting that way? no. so whats the alternative? a void existence just taking the backseat and never doing anything i dont feel like i have to or want to do? i think maybe i can justify acting as though i wasnt born 5 seconds ago just from the fact that if im going to have any goal or live in any good or even self beneficial way i have to act as though i have an understanding of what i would like or dislike doing. otherwise i couldnt say eating food will taste good or make my hunger or urge go away. its like, if it WERE true that i was just born it wouldnt matter if i take it to be true or not anyway so i'd might as well assume my memories are true to an extent that i can make beneficial decisions. but thats still a void existence. i could still deny lots of memories at any time if theyre unnecessary for my happiness. why treat memories as though theyre consistent or accurate? even regular people believe their memories are inaccurate to a varying degree. theres no reason to set the precedent that because i have to accept some memories are legitimate that it means i must accept all memories. the only thing challenging that view is the irrational unfounded belief that curses me with anxiety and stress. the belief that something i do will actually be bad for me in the long term.

so then how, when staring in to the void, do you extend your beliefs to others? well it seems to me that to be consistent in my belief that i cant justify the existence of others, i'd might as well just be selfish. if anyone has any objections to my flavor of epistemic nihilism, then by all means. its not like i want to see things this way.",0

I have realized, in reality, **that I have no control over my life.** My brain is the true mastermind behind everything. I would say currently I am just surviving. I don't have a large group of friends, haven't done anything relationship-wise, weak social and educational skills from lack of education (went to an all-boys religious school with little focus on secular studies), but I am also in a good situation where my physiological and safety needs are met. I would say I am just living, but not doing anything with my life. I just came into existence because of my parents choosing to have kids. I got caught up in some sadistic thoughts on why to do anything at all. Everyone seems to say you should chase a fulfilling life, but I asked why. Why choose a life fulfilling over a non-fulfilling life? This lead me to the realization, that whatever I do, my brain and body is the one that chooses the set of options.

Therefore, whether I choose to live a fulfilling life or not. My brain is going to control what I do with myself. **The only reason why I want to live a fulfilling life is to make my brain happy and the only reason not to do it is because my brain will then try to make itself happy through bad mechanisms. Why make the brain happy at all?** It seems like the brain is our only way of interacting with reality. It has set the options of how we are supposed to live our lives. However, some of the main issues with this are: 1, your potentiality is defined by things outside of your control, 2 the things to actualize your potentiality are also outside of your control, and these 2 things led me to the realization that you don't control what your destiny is and it is defined by your brain, and even if you do choose a destiny set by your brain you don't have much control over achieving it.   


Even though I don't think that I am going through depression, I thought about self-annihilation as being the cure to this problem, but it isn't. If you self-end yourself are then left with 2 options. Option 1, there is an afterlife and you still have little control over your outcome in the afterlife, or option 2 is you go into non-being and cease to exist. This seems like to not fix the problem at all, as you can't attribute anything to non-being, so it's basically useless and you are dealing with the same existential problems.

And your fat old lady because she cooks, empties your balls and gives you kids to care for you when you're old and afraid of dying. But slap your kid just once and he'll take revenge when you're old. In fact, that slap is exactly what he wants. When he throws you in the rest home, it'll be his excuse to mask the natural disinterest that we all feel toward our sires. No that baby they want to trap me with, I don't like him. And I know he'll feel the same. No. Fucking isn't worth it. It costs a bundle. Yet it makes the time go by. But stop wanting to fuck and you know your time on earth is over. That's the best this shitty life has to offer. Nothing but a reproduction code written in your balls.",0
1702328966.0,Nihilism makes life MORE meaningful,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments seeming to say that nihilism makes life meaningless, depressing, bleak, and empty. This is a misunderstanding of what is meant by *objective* meaning versus *subjective* meaning. 

Here I will use *meaning*, *purpose*, and *value* interchangeably though I do not think they are entirely equivalent, I'll leave that for a different discussion. 

*Subjective* meaning is that value system an individual assigns to their own existence, experiences, and relationships. It is an entirely personal internal value system. 

*Objective* meaning implies some kind of greater purpose or plan to reality and existence which in turn implies some kind of being who could create plans and purpose, some kind of universal schemer. If we reject the idea of *the divine* or any kind of god, and admit our observations indicate a mechanical universe, then the idea of an objective meaning of existence becomes absurd. In this way atheism leads directly to existential nihilism in philosophical thought. 


In nihilism we reject the very idea of any *objective* meaning. 

Let's consider a mathematic analogy:

If the total meaning of existence is equal to Subjective Meaning + Objective meaning then we need to determine the values. A strictly deterministic view of reality puts all of the value in objective meaning and denies any value to subjective meaning. However, if we instead say that there is no objective meaning possible at all, then that leaves all the meaning and value that can exist in subjective meaning. The subjective meaning is infinitely valuable as it contains all concepts of value. 

If we arrange our lives such that we imagine it's value is *less* than an imagined *eternal reward* then the meaning and value of our lives here is diminished. If we imagine that our lives only value is to receive some reward after death and our actions here are only to achieve this reward, we have removed all intrinsic value from our lives, and turned them into a commodity to trade for this imagined (and entirely lacking in any objective evidence) after life. It is easy to see how religious extremism causes believers to throw their lives away, often violently taking other with them, to get this *reward*

Metaphysical eternal reward systems devalue human life, nihilism makes subjective meaning the only kind that exists. When it's all we have it's value is infinite. 

Now let's consider the economics of time:

If I tell you you have one month left to live, what does that do to the value of each day? I would say economics dictates that it increases the value of each day massively. If I tell you you have one hundred years left to live what does that do to the value of each day? What of 100,000 years? What of infinite time?

If time and existence is infinite it's value drops infinitely, it is the limited nature of our time that directly gives it subjective value for us. Supply and Demand. 

Every single moment of existence is subjectively infinitely  valuable *specifically* because there is no objective meaning.

General statement of nihlism goes like ""There is nothing meaningful in life"" or ""nothing has meaning"". If you truly are aligned with this line, I mean it, to the very core. Then you realise that the line ""nothing has meaning"" or ""there is no meaning in life"" is meaningless as well. And your very thoughts loses meaning too, the process of thinking, loses its flair, unless you define a definite goal, and understand that, that goal is meaningless.


The above statements align well with Buddhists principle of *Sansara*(universe) and how it is made of *Maya*(illusion). And we are in this *Maya jaal*(web of illusion). Let me define this in nihlistic perspective. For example someone thinks, ""this thing has no meaning"" and keep on repeating that. Then visual representation of it would be like this.

1
1
1
1
.... Upto infinity 

I have defined above 1 as a loop, where person is defining everything as meaningless. Now, then the person says, ""oh, me defining things as meaningless is meaningless"". The person has created another loop.

1
1-1
1-1-1
1-1-1-1
... to infinity

And thus defining everything as meaningless, person get stuck in this web of meaninglessness. It's a web of intellectual pride. How do you know that you are stuck in it? When you know that there is something in this world which doesn't align with what you stated and for that you have to observer very carefully.


This is where the concept of being true comes. A true scientist discard his ego, which makes binds him with particular dogma, so that he can actually know. Similar is the experience of true religious one, he who discard every religious dogma and keep in the search for god, which results in death of ego.


Why is it so tough to be true? Isn't it because of our pride, our ego which tells us, that what we have found is of supreme, of the maximum essance. Even though, we are not the one who found it, they are passed on ideas, which ""I"" have pondered over. The ""we"" or ""I"" in equation don't exist, when it comes to thoughts, or do they? But, what I am sure of is, when we hang on to these thoughts our perception become blurry, which stops the pursuit of truth. And if you want to seek truth, it it exist, it's proper that you lose this ego.",0
1702305082.0,Is pooping your pants better or worse than not pooping your pants?,"This is from a response in a thread here, but wanted to get people's thoughts on the idea that nihilism gets in the way of making decisions. 

Your existence, and your ability to differentiate between X being better or worse than Y, is contingent on being human. 

Therfore, I can make an ethical claim that embraced meaninglessness is actually wrong. You should not live that way, because in order to do so you must throw out your ability to use mental hierarchies to make decisions. It's logically incoherent. Since no one really can live that way, and the world would cease to function if everyone did so (i.e Kant's universalizability principle), existential nihilism is wrong. 

You have convinced yourself that you KNOW your place in the universe, but that doesn't mean you have a legit claim to a deeper understanding of reality. 

Staring into the abyss is about voluntarily looking at the darkest part of your own being, becoming aware of your own tendency towards self deception and evil. Then you have enough awareness to choose good and truth. 

The truth is, nihilism frees us from taking responsibility for the well-being of the world, the people around us, and even ourselves. This is why it attracts people, not because it is a logically sound philosophy.",0
1702191691.0,"Destined to mediocrity, closer to the edge than ever","For the theory of evolution, modern man's creator, genesis and god, to work, inevitably we all start out in life with a combination of unchangeable hereditary traits, some of which are objectivly better (->better predictors of success) than others.

This means that, before we are born, we are either assigned a high value genetic profile, or not.

Examples like IQ, sociability (yes, extremly hereditary), height, attractiveness etc. come to mind. There are even genes related to how hard your able to work, which I find to be the most butal one. 

It even get's worse: Instead of those genes being assigned fairly, to balance each other out, or at least being assigned randomly, good/bad genes often are concentrated among each other in individuals, because the genetic quality of your ancestors determined the genetic quality of the mate they were able to attract. 

While this MUST hold true for the theroy of evolution to work, our society at large seems extremly oblivious to this: We are all hold to nearly the same standarts of success in our careers and social life.

I'm now able to attract mediocre girls I don't really find attractive (perception is fcked bcause of internet porn) which is a step up from only attracting fat girls in HS, but I will never be truly exceptional at anything because of my genetic sealing IQ and looks wise.

1702140266.0,Unearthing Magic Post-Nihilism,"
My last post on Reddit was written in the depth of my own darkness. I’ve gone through a lot of loss and grief over the last few years, and I started to see nihilism and, quite frankly, apathy, as the only solution. But I’ve come out of that since and thought I’d share. I know those of you still swept into nihilism as a seemingly permanent state will not appreciate what I’ve written below. But maybe someone will. I believe wholeheartedly still in the necessity of nihilism. But I do believe Nietzsche never intended nihilism to be an end goal, rather a stepping stone of shedding before being born into something new—the childlike spirit we often neglect. 

Alas:

“What, in fact, do we know about the peak experience? Well, to begin with, we know one thing that puts us several steps ahead of the most penetrating thinkers of the 19th century: that P.E’.s are not a matter of pure good luck or grace. They don’t come and go as they please, leaving ‘this dim, vast vale of tears vacant and desolate’. Like rainbows, peak experiences are governed by definite laws. They are ‘intentional’.”
Colin Wilson

Often mystical experiences are attributed to people steeped in religion. It’s rare you hear about an atheist consumed by wonder and glory. And I think it’s because religious people have a clear narrative to life, death, and personhood. Their own subjectivity becomes wrapped up in an overarching objective narrative that is outside of them. They simply mold themselves into this pre-existing narrative with blueprints for mystical experiences. A sort of contextualism.

For those of us who are not religious, mystical experiences are fought for, earned. And I believe the foundation of these experiences lies in the creation of a narrative. I’ve touched on it briefly in previous posts this week, how knowing our death (or at least being mindful of it) can help us create a narrative arc for our own life — when we see a definitive “end” we can shape the middle with more fervor. It’s when we lose sight of the climax and the last page that we get lost in the lagging middle.

I don’t mean that mystical experiences are self-constructionist endeavors. I think it only starts in self-constructionism. But I do believe that it must start there. It must begin with your own narrative – the life story you design for yourself.

This is where I believe intelligence and knowingness come in. Going into the depths of yourself — your mind, your heart, your every thought and fear. There’s deconstruction involved here — ego dissolution. Dare I say … nihilism. The complete shedding of all pre-conceived beliefs, notions, fears, loves. Shed them, and sit in the darkness of nihilism, of complete darkness, alone.

Sit there. Just sit there. Not creating. Not avoiding. Just experiencing it — intentional passivity— letting it happen to you, letting it consume you until you are no more.

This is not for the faint of heart and I think when people throughout history spoke of this post-nihilistic enlightened state, they deemed it rare because it is. It involves an insanely brave level of self-awareness — self-awareness that can be honest with itself in both directions. Neither too grandiose or too self-deprecating. Honest. With the self. And intelligent enough to deconstruct and reconstruct the self without guidance. This is not easy. It’s not for the faint of heart or mind. And it’s rare.

However, post-darkness, if the person can rise from this darkness reborn, the true narrative of Self is made. Shaped by the Self. And the Self only.

After this it gets fun. Because once that place in life is found — mysticism can unfurl as a garden reaching the sky. It can transform the entire way you perceive the world. Magic is born. No religion necessary. And though I adore neuroscience and its many explanations for all things human — I don’t know if this comes down to plasticity or biology. I don’t know enough on the science of this to speak much on it, but from personal experience I can say that this is beyond the mind.

Begins in the mind, but the true mystical way is found when we allow our minds to expand beyond our mind. We step out of our mind. Not in a passive way. It’s very much active. It’s very much intentional. But it’s outside of us where we find the true brightness and wonder of life.

So deconstruction, self-construction, and then a stepping out and beyond. I’m not even sure how I can explain the method for this, other than … when you get there you’ll know.

What I can say, however, is that like the religious, you need a narrative in order to find this place. A story you write of your life that you actually believe. And if you can’t see the point in that yet, then you haven’t fully deconstructed. Because when you deconstruct you are at a life or death moment. You either reconstruct or die — die before you’re dead or kill yourself because you can find no point in living. But if you’ve deconstructed and want to find life again … you will reconstruct and it’s there, after your self-written narrative, that you will be able to expand inward and outward and discover that “air of mysticism” in your own life.

We create the fertile ground for mystical experiences, with our self-constructionist narrative, but it’s only the fertile ground we provide. The rest happens naturally as we allow it. A conscious choice to welcome the seeds and watch the garden reach toward the sky. If we are alert, ready, primed, and wanting … it simply happens. But not without awareness and intention. Magic must be fought for and earned. A life or death battle for Brightness.

I can change them! I can get that law passed. Then their midlife passes, they realize they can maybe make a dent in their local politics... Maybe a call to the local congressman MIGHT get to voicemail, that email to whoever controls the tax tarrifs might get a read... soon enough after decades of work, they look back at what they've accomplished. A degree or a masters, or whatever, not much else. Sure there's some work that was done, but was any of it really remembered? Did they make the headlines at any point about this change which they thought was so good for whatever cause it was, it doesn't matter. You don't need specifics. All you can see around you is a society parading about entertainment, obsessed with the latest version of beauty that contradicts what was beautiful a century before. 

And sadly, as this idealistic individual ages, which they must, their mind ages as well. And with an aged mind comes more introspection (usually) - and if you haven't accomplished what your past self clung to hope to, you turn into a bitter person who will admit ""I once thought we could solve the potholes on the highway, now I'll settle for a sidewalk that is walkable next to my house""

This world wears the most hopeful of us down. It's pointless. Trying your hardest to do much of anything here but serve your own narrative and means doesn't make sense.

3) I don't even know if I'd call myself a nihilist as I do not follow many of the ideations, and I certainly don't believe this species should involuntarily go extinct - or anything in that realm at all. (Not saying that's what it means to be a nihilist at all, but certainly how the rest of Reddit views it.) What I *do* believe is that it may be better for the future sanity of *us* but also the state of the natural world and all other animals/species if we go extinct naturally. From something like a super volcano, or astroid, or whatever else.

4) The above scenario is only most desirable if it occurs while we're still this primitive; if we're expected to get dumber or last a lot longer at our current intelligence (1000s of years), it may not be worth it. I personally believe it would take 10s of thousands of years for us to ""stop being so primitive"" and work together, smarter, like it is believed to be required for survival on Earth and spreading to other parts of the universe.

He saw that most of them, in common with their cast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries. Warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal sensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found fault with the social order. Never could they realise that their brute foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of chidhood and innocence."" 

\- Excerpt from '*The Silver Key*,' by H.P. Lovecraft

I was around 19 years old (I'm 34 today) and I remember going to the library near my house to look for some Lovecraft books. I had seen a Japanese horror/thriller movie called ""Goth"" in which, in one scene, the woman in the lead role appears reading a Lovecraft book. I got interested, and when I was leafing through one of his books, I read exactly that paragraph you posted. I remember well my first impression after reading the paragraph. At first it took me a while to organize my understanding of what was written, then I felt a slight relief and a small joy at finally having found something in which I could identify with what I had been feeling for some time.

I don't know what your opinion is on the subject of ""Joy of Pessimism"", but after this first contact I had with Lovecraft's literature, which consequently led me to study more about the subject, I have now been able to develop a feeling of more calm and tranquillity. What about you?",0

I'm a new father, this has been the first year of my child's life. I have also just gotten married this year as well. 

Over the past couple of weeks I've been in this huge pit of despair, suicidal, numb and hazy. I don't know where it's coming from, but I feel useless, I feel like everyone looks down on me. I cant do a simple task without confusion, I question myself too much and feel anxiety with every task. I don't feel close to my wife, or anybody for that matter but my son. 

I try to remind myself of my belief, this is all meaningless, but I choose to live in the absurdity. I live here for my son, I will continue to exist for him. I just don't want him to grow up with a self-loathing dad who couldn't keep shit together. 

Im trying to take steps to get better, keeping in less-stressful situations. Relaxing alittle more, doing stuff I enjoy. But I'm constantly on the verge of crying, nihilism keeps me grounded. It brings me comfort, I hope it does the same for you too.

1701432265.0,"Questioning existence, why the design of life is evil","lets talk about the design of the world, I can understand how there is a general design to life, as in the way living beings live, herbivores, carnivores, ecosystems, heaven above and earth below as the elements that make up the world, earth, water, fire, wood, air, space...

my point is there is a underlying design to the world but there is also not much of a design in terms of what occurs and how the world moves or atleast its not apparent to us, world is basically just ""created"" and let go to be itself.

everything is extremely random, let alone evolution but life itself is random, you cannot choose what parents you are born with, you cannot choose what person you become or the circumstances you live in, no one in the world can know wheter the life of someone will be easy or difficult, you can be here today and dead in a car crash tomorrow, its very unpredictable.

like it is very hard to know how things will go or to predict them, you can feel the happiest today before feeling full of sorrow tomorrow, you can have been feeling healthy for years before unexpectedly falling sick for a long period of time...

of course, I do not disagree that there is an underlying system of things, a fish knows how to swim instinctively, a buffalo knows how to walk, eat, reproduce, we know when we are hungry or what we need, I know how to use my fingers to type this instinctively although yes it could be debated wheter I am really in control or not and wheter free will is there or not or wheter its all predetermined or not.

its very mysterious what existence is.

my underlying problem with the world is its impermenance, I tried to accept that and I can talk about it but it feels there is a human side to things that make one feel attached to things and this attachment inevitably leads to suffering.

we can talk about how suffering is an aspect of life but it still hits hard, in the middle of suffering, no matter how you rationalise it, it doesn't work, there are ways to cope but it seems there is an inherent way human beings are.

thats why I have always questioned specifically why such a design?

lets just rule out mental suffering but even physical suffering, lets just get out of human society for a second, lets go to nature.

in nature, you can never guarentee shelter nor food, you can be eaten at any moment, let alone the amount of starving animals and those just dying because of natural disasters like drought..

animals are forced to eat each other to survive, they have miserable lives, one injury is enough to seal their fates, their whole existence is chasing to eat to not starve and reproduce, a herbivore has to always be in the lookout before being devoured yet even the being who devoured it, lets say the mountain lion, even it was starving and needed food to survive and even as it survives it has to constantly kill to be granted a continued life and not to die of starvation.

at some point you gotta question, what's the point of it all?

just don't have a world, why create an impermanent world that's so full of suffering and especially create emotional beings within it?

we can all talk about how humans could withstand all these hardships of life but I cannot help but its misery pure and simply, there will always be pain and suffering.

my point is this, all Beings are Pure and innocent, from the murderer to the robber to the killer to the saint to the most good to most pure evil, from the most human to the most inhumane, from animals to human beings, all Pure

even the most notorious serial killer was just a child one day and even if he had a mental problem that mental problem itself is a problem in the design of how he was made not of his own fault.

to me, it is the very Design of the world that I see is inherently evil, of course there is no line demarcating good from evil, they can be in each other and there is no law defining them but still...

we are pretty much slaves to our programming

we often times want to be good, even suffer from our own evil but that side nonetheless cannot be denied, we also often don't have much of a choice.

Should I go blame a country for invading another? but ressources are limited and they are necessary to maintain one's nation.

Should I blame humanity for polluting the earth? but pollution was necessary to rise up from the misery of life and whole economies and people depend on pollution to survive.

Should one go blame the mass genociders? but whats the difference between them and a tornado decimating a city, yes they are human and? there is no difference between genocide and a tsunami, its the same manifestation of the world at different scales

of course these terms are very vague themselves but again, lets just take human beings..

is there even a single person who wants to hurt others just for the sake of it? Not really in a sane human being, most people would choose peace if possible but point is ressources are limited, things move and change constantly.

there always has to be a reason for these ""bad"" things and this reason right here is the very design of the world.

there is no difference between you killing a nest of hornets and a tornedo ravaging a city, its just the same phenomena on a very different scale.

but even if you didn't kill the hornets nest, these type of things are the very rule of the world. they are bound to happen no matter what you do.

you eat animals to survive and when you will die, other organisms will feed on you as well.

there is no problem with that but I find human beings were somehow of a mistake of the world, although animals suffer they do not have the cognition to have deeper experiences, to know more, to attach to people, to love, to experience, to desire more...

But Yes of course, there is also goodness in it, there is love, there is beauty in the world and these things are worth it

but I find that pain, suffering, impermanence completely spoils this beauty and goodness, not enough for me to completely nihilistic but enough for me to despise the way of things.

in front of such a world, all you can do is be still and let go of things.

to flow like water uncaring of whatever the fuck happens, not because its most efficient, you think all a person cares about is efficiency?

there are too many elements at play to try and grab an outcome, no one can grab gain or loss, you can save loads of money yet still end up homeless, you can do everything in your power yet still fail, anyone who ever succeeded was lucky because they first had the circumstances of being able to bring such a thing into existence as well as survivor bias.

but of course one must try anyway since one has no choice but one shouldn't be attached to outcome atleast for me, do it what you can in the present and leave the rest for fate

Human life with such thoughts makes the best way to live is to just let oneself be moved by the elements of the world and the winds of causation till the the body dies and one is back to freedom

although I do find that hardships can be good as they strengthen oneself and forge onself into a stronger more resilient as well as more wise version but I still find that it is at the expense of the person's perpetual suffering

I mean lets just take work, money, problems, sickness, unfairness, people and the elements that come into play into one's life, life is not easy! not at all, for no one and if you fight it, you will just make it harder but you will still have to fight anyway.

I do think that that's where the buddhist and hindu concept of non-attachment and renunciation of life came from.

water moves through holes, fills them up and moves on, like this I think man should move through predicaments, solve them and move through them without too much mental suffering or care, basically to be uncaring, to move through life unfettered and move on without unecessary conflict that just makes it even harder.",0
1701446742.0,“Life is meaningless” is much less true of a statement than “Meaning is created”.,"i was just reflecting on how the statement “life is meaningless” is both less true and less useful than the rarely heard “meaning is created”. 

even though at face value, to most nihilists both would seem equally true, it is more accurate to say that meaning is created, than to say it is nonexistent. if we conscious beings exist in the universe, and meaning is something our consciousness is experiencing, then meaning actually does exist, and even in a very objective sense. its just *created*, by causes, conditions, and connections through space and time which carry significance within a being’s consciousness. meaning can only be said to ultimately not exist, if one is willing to claim that consciousness ultimately does not exist. 

from the perspective of a conscious being who’s aware that it’s nervous system (or other feeling apparatus) is capable of meaning-making and of reaping real, measurable benefits from that for both oneself and other beings, life is utterly full of opportunities to make meaning. 

it would never occur to a being with such a mode of awareness to conclude that just because meaning is a flexible creation of conscious beings, it somehow *doesn’t exist*. 

and, at least in the real of human beings, it appears there are certain states of being — creativity, generosity, receiving gratitude, connecting deeply — which create meaning for the benefit of many. and the biological, electrochemical, electromagnetic mechanisms that underlie all those experiences, do not somehow erase the conscious being experiencing them and the fact that there is indeed a conscious being, just like you, experiencing them. 

from “meaning is created”, you aren’t forfeiting the game or pretending you don’t exist. you are made aware of the game and invited to play.",0

1701332774.0,Nihilistic arguments can be used to prove both atheism and Religion.,"So what I see that Westerners only believe nihilistic arguments to be a part of atheism but Indian religions used nihilistic arguments to debate atheists.

For example,

Ancient Empiricist Atheists- There is no evidence for your claims as we can not perceive Rebirth or Nirvana through the five senses and the five senses are only ways of knowing. Instead we should enjoy the material pleasures of world and focus on living.

Some Buddhist style arguments -

The things you call as material pleasures such as Food, Gold etc are made of parts and those parts are divided into further parts into atoms and molecules (Anu is the smallest unit of matter in Indian philosophy which cannot be seen through eyes). So what you call as Gold or Food is just a form acquired through combination of atoms and molecules and the form is not real only the parts are real.

What you have in life like marriage, beliefs and morality are combination of multiple parts of beliefs and views, something that you picked up from this world and so they do not matter. The form of belief that ""Life is Good"" is a form acquired through combination of these parts of beliefs. 

At the end everything you believe to be True is a combination of parts. So none of them is true when you seperate the parts.

Atheist- So what's the point of teaching your philosophy? Your philosophy must be Form of beliefs too.

""I am not taking a stance just refuting your claims. I don't want to prove anything except refutation of your claims"".

This is not nihilism exactly but this kind of arguments reduces every Truth we know into parts and refuting them.

Edit: This is not a rejection of Atheism. Just saying Nihilistic arguments can be used in favor of religions.

Edit 2:- ""Real"" means permanent and immortal. Anything that is impermanent is transient and has no meaning or Ultimate purpose. Thus it must be rejected like a Fantasy. Buddha didn't force his belief on anyone. He asked to question all authorities including Buddha himself. If anyone is satisfied then can follow Buddha otherwise they are free to do whatever they want. This proves Buddha was a Liberal and Critical Thinker who didn't care about Authorities.",0

I am a moral nihilist as well as a nihilist, and what annoys me is when I talk to people about it they say

""Oh then I could just kill your family or you then?"" 
And then they get all proud of themselves thinking they have somehow won.

When the answer to that is yes, sure you could murder me or my family, or you could decide to torture an orphan none of these things are 'bad' and none of them matter.

I wouldent kill my dog because I love my dog, but that doesn't mean killing my dog is a bad thing, as good or bad is just an opinion and holds no intrinsic truth.

Then they usualy go on to say

""How can you care about your dog or your family then?""

And the answer to that is that I have the meaningless baseless and pointless opinion that my dog is floofy and cute, just because I recognise the inaccuracy of my opinions, doesn't mean I don't have them.

Human morals are just a subject of our own evolution as a social species, a healthy dose of eugenics and societal brainwashing, they arent anything special, its just what randomly happend.

Another argument moralistic people make is,

""Without morals society wouldent exist""

And my answer to that is ""and?""

A society or civilization holds no value either, a valueless object (societies in this case) will not give value to another valueless system (morality)

That's like saying a key makes it possible to open a lock, therefore keys are incredibly important and without them you are not a human, it's a completely insane argument.

But by the time you have said all of this, the other person just ignores it.
Its like talking to a religious person, they don't want what your saying to be true, so they just pretend it isn't.

Third of all, I know that creating inherent meaning out of the world (and the existence of a Jesus) is directly contradictory to this thing, but still hear me out.

Agnostic Theism; belief in a God, accompanied by uncertainty that one exists. If it's not nihilistic, then what is it, for example, if you don't think that there's any meaning to the existence of a God, or of a system of morality, or of an afterlife. I mostly don't really live my life with an afterlife in mind either, and I wouldn't care if it didn't exist, but I believe in all of those concepts anyway (because indoctrination). 

Also, I haven't really perceived an objective moral meaning as incompatible to a lack of meaning, even though they are technically incompatible. I can't really explain it, but the most I can do is compare it to be more of a guideline than a rigid system. Does that sound strange? Idk.

1700146560.0,Emotions are an objective truth of reality.,"That human beings have emotional responses to our environments and experiences, which dictate a large amount if not at some level all of our behavior, is an objective truth. That these emotions frame our lives and the quality of our lives, and highly influence the quality of life for all the humans we see and interact with, is objectively true. 

If some hyper-intelligent aliens visited us and came with some scanner that could view any human’s neurological activity in real time, they would observe objectively that the neuro-electric “energy in motion” moving throughout human bodies is what literally leads us to our beliefs, choices, lifestyles; everything. 

This is also why in controlling people, manipulating emotions is the name of the game. From the perspective of any successful manipulator, you don’t want to encourage anyone to think too critically if you benefit from them feeling emotionally compelled to do something that benefits you.

What I’m calling “emotion” is of course mediated by various complex interactions within the brain & the rest of the nervous system, involving neurotransmitters and electrical currents. They are also highly influenced by mind activity — the things we hold to be true within our subconscious minds. But they ultimately manifest as qualia, as visceral body experiences that we conscious beings actually sense and *feel*. And that energetic movement that our consciousness can sense in these bodies, is what mobilizes us through our lives. It is objectively real as a mobilizing force in our human consciousness. 

So by making us *feel* something via painting some sort of picture in our minds (for example how companies use advertisements to imprint the picture that their product = happiness, onto peoples subconscious minds) powerful people can control our behavior. 

This is both scary and liberating depending on how you look at it. It is clear that the media and corporations and governments have many people on earth under their various emotional spells. This is the scary part, since many of those sources do not send out the best messages. 

But the liberating part is that, “powerful people”, to some real underrated degree, actually includes us. Our own selves. If we make the choice to, going forward, take on primary responsibility for further influence on our own minds, and for how we influence our own nervous systems to feel+respond to our world, it means we can make the emotional patterns that fuel us, into ones of more optimum wellbeing, fulfillment, and joy. 

There being no fixed determined meanings other than the ones we humans co-create via the ways we condition eachother’s nervous systems, means a vast range of freedom in possible experienced realities. When we tap into *our own minds* (as well as the minds of those who genuinely inspire us to feel deeper and better), and re-route what psycho-emotional maps our bodies follow and think by, the lives we live as conscious beings could likely become ones of supreme beauty.

1700073936.0,"A futuristic spaceship-body: If you radically alter the environment, selves will radically alter. Your self is only an accident of your contingent environment. Everything about your self could have been radically different.","(TLDR) No, a half-mile wide human embedded and controlled spaceship-body is not an abomination to nature, to humans, or to our selves. We did not create some monster. There are no monsters. Our selves are creations of our social world. If we radically alter our social world, we radically our selves. Evolution and DNA does not create some standard human self or human environment.

**A Different Self**

We can imagine 2000 years in the future the following procedure: A fetus is developed rather normally. We have standard DNA/epigenetic structure, perhaps slight cognitive enhancement, but still very much human.

Then, at birth, we prepare the baby to *become* a half-mile wide, star hopping space ship. We remove all limbs and plug peripheral nerves into ship sensors and into thrusters and flaps. We carefully remove the eyes and ears and plug those sensory systems into new “eyes.” These can be sensory systems that see a great range of the electromagnetic spectrum. We plug other visual nerves into instrument converters that feed the brain with other information, about radiation for example.

Our newborn human, our slightly enhanced brain, is now learning to govern the motion and sensory systems of the ship. Where brains once navigated through the human body, they now govern a ship-body. For the most part, we can still imagine this brain as running through many of the thought processes of us today, including of the representations that it has of its self. We can allow it to still run on emotions, if we want. We could still have desires, fear, and doubt. We could still have many of the characteristics that we see in us today. (Don't ask about sex.)

These kinds of thoughts remind us of several things. There is not some endpoint to evolution that was “human.” There is not an endpoint that looks like our selves today, living in a ""normal"" environment and body. The above story is not an abomination to humans, because nature cares nothing for this false essentializing of the “human"" or of the environment.

All evolution did was end up with a DNA structure like the one that sits inside our cells. Importantly, nature was not trying to create a “human” that lives in a standard earth and pack-societal environment. Our DNA may have developed within such processes, but there was not some desire of evolution that humans/DNA remain within that environment.

Furthermore, there is not some genuine self sitting within our DNA just waiting to emerge into existence. Pretty much any kind of characteristic that we have today can be grossly changed given a radically different environment. Many of those characteristics can be radically changed through normal social environmental changes that we are capable of today. Even today we can radically change the characteristics of our sexuality, our introversion/extroversion, our gender, our knowledge attainment, and so on. We can of course also edit DNA pre- and post-birth, as well as other chemical and brain alterations.

A cheap shot, but you should hit over the head anyone talking about expression of their true self. We can give better descriptions of our selves than that. There are interesting tales to tell about how our DNA becomes what we are. Our selves are products of a contingent social environment. One that we as society choose. Your self is determined by your parents and community. That could have been done completely differently. We can build radically different selves for the next line of selves, if we choose.

Stories about why we are the way we are will require a rich combination of genes and environment. When we de-essentialize the human condition, when we de-essentialize our selves, we can begin to tell the interesting stories about why we are the way we are. We can only do that by seeing the openness of the social and environmental world.

1700094914.0,"Trying to live with morals and empathy for all, to my own detriment.","I was young when I came to the life shattering realization that nothing in life has any true intrinsic value and life beyond life is nothing. Due to this realization and not really perhaps being old or wise enough to understand my feelings I ended up getting involved in drugs and crime without any regard for my health, wellbeing or anyone else's feelings. I acted completely amoral and I didn't really care about anything or how that affected anyone. It wasn't until I made a mistake so huge that my life completely changed, I was now a felon and i had shamed myself and my families name (we live in a small town in NZ). Somehow I had gone from realizing god wasn't around and that life is just what it is to not caring about people at all and throwing everything away. 

Im unsure if it was because I had a conscience that I had buried down that when I had done this I completely broke down into an emotional, nervous wreck. I honestly can't tell you if its because I feel bad or because I'd ruined my family name, my reputation and future opportunities, and I dont think that really matters. Ive lived since then trying to turn my life completely around, being kind to all and working on myself and my anti social traits, sharing my positive mindset with others etc. It's been almost 7 years since my big ""mistake"" (it was a heavily publicized theft with no name supression, to be more clear). I have come a long way, but I feel as though im fading away, as ive been working on the betterment of myself ive been watching the worlds' collapse around me. I still feel the same way that nothing really matters and being kind and a ""good"" person is all done out of the motivation that I know it is logically beneficial to society, my children (as a role model) and good for me. But realistically it is killing me. I am miserable knowing nothing matters and nothing i do is anything more than trivial. 

What I ask is how can I feel this way without taking things to the extreme ? If nothing matters I feel I should be able to do what I want, although I cant. and that means that im being locked down by people and not a god. Im so conflicted. I may sound immature, but I am just being honest. How can I help my mentality evolve into one where I can achieve some kind of contentment whilst understanding nothing matters ? ",0

I've considered myself an absurdist for quite a while. Although, I never really understood the animosity nihilists get from absurdists. All your points totally made sense to me. 

Not so long ago, I finally realized that I'm a theoretical nihilist (the existential kind, not the moral one). But I'm a 100% practical absurdist. 

I think like an existential nihilist. But I act like an absurdist. Live out of spite, seek joy and not meaning (since there's none to be found anyways, on which we all agree here). 

My whole life is a rebellion against the meaninglessness. But I cannot **think** like an absurdist to save my life.

When you try to imagine what is ""nothingness"", your brain has started to imagine SOMETHING. So to ""grasp"" nothingness, you just have to stop thinking, stop imagining, stop seeing, stop smelling... That is nothingness.

And the brain HATE neutrality. It is either good or bad for our brain. Neutrality is like the absence of a tag for an event... Our brain loves to put the tag ""good"" or ""bad"" on thing, it is in our nature. It's why depressed use nihilism as the absence of meaning as their reason to be depressed actually they are not about the lack of meaning, they are just sad BECAUSE they lack dopamine in their brain.

Philosophy is really trying to be too complex for this world which is actually so damn simple.

Nothingness = neither good neither bad.

Our brain loves to think that it is nothingness at death because we naturally avoid negatives events (only a real insane person in an asylum would not), so the brain understand nothingness as ""no bad"" and he loves that.

I don't think we're really here for any higher purpose or goal but rather simply a byproduct of atoms mashing together creating life. Here's the thing however, with our current understanding there are potentially dozens of atoms which can't be formed naturally by our space time. Materials not found in nature like plutonium. They are in a sense, aritificial. 

Perhaps the whole point of our existence is to just contribute to the needs of the universe, in essence we are a planet in our own sense. We're a black hole in a different way.

Meanwhile humans are constantly in thought, questioning not only our existence but that of the universe and of a higher power.

1698468564.0,Congratulations you are an atheist. Now shed the rest of your empty cultural baggage.,"Congratulations you are an atheist. 

Now discard other discordant beliefs. Hold your self at arm's length. 

One of the best arguments against religion is the fact that most people believe their parents' beliefs. An iranian is muslim. A roman is catholic or polytheistic. A german is protestant. Even your basic belief about god is only there because of your background. 

Belief in god and your particular religion is wrong because it is not grounded in empiricism. It is merely grounded in word of mouth. Your parents' beliefs came from their parents' beliefs. 

The reason why this argument is so devastating is because when you on reflect religious belief, all you can do is ground it in the folk tales told by people. The places where religion tries to attach itself to reality is a shambles. Laughable. Which means, all there is, is word of mouth and nonsense abstract notions pulled out of thin air.

I am asking you today to set aside all beliefs of your parents and culture. And not just the foolish. But all of it. See your parents' world. See your world. See your self as a product of that world. See your created self as a non-critical product of that world. All sorts of judgments, structures, identities, and behavior flows through your self. You, your self, your brain/mind, was slowly created by a world you could not see while you were being programmed by it. You were programmed for more than a decade in your parents' world. There are endless cultural structures to that world that are as empty as religion. Some of those will be small and benign cultural artefacts. Some of that programming may even flow from empirical knowledge, which is fine to keep hold of. 

But the vast majority of who you are is empty cultural baggage. As empty as that religious baggage that you so readily shed. Why you have rubber-stamped all the other cultural baggage I do not know. Now, of course you do not really have a choice. Some of this stuff is just part and parcel of you, of your self. A lot of it, though, are things that you can stop taking seriously. Just like you have stopped taking your cultural religion seriously.

My argument here. Is that it is not just religion you should shed. But a great deal of your self, beliefs, behaviors, and identity.

   
You should do this not because all of these things are as wrong as religion. Some of them are just benign culture. The bigger problem is that they weave there way into the programming of your brain/mind in a way that you cannot even see. We need to see our cultural world, so we can evaluate it and change it. We need to see the structures of our self, of our psychology, so that we can evaluate it and change it. If we choose to change it (free will does not exist).  ",0

It's designed to distract people from the meaninglessness of life by giving them absurd ideas to believe in. One of religion's main roles is to suppress the feminine principle, which is why religions like Christianity and Islam tend to not have a very high opinion of women. Look at all the crazy things that happen in insane asylums like Iran and Afghanistan. What do they use to justify what they do when for example they [burn a woman to death](https://youtu.be/1skvcNVXjro?t=434) for being accused of tearing the pages of the Koran?

It doesnt help either that as I get older it feels like time is going by faster, which just makes me feel like I’m getting closer and closer to death.

I am a overall happy person but I’ve noticed lately I’m so consumed by my death its distracting me from being able to really enjoy my time. 

It feels like I’m waiting to die, like I know it’s coming, and time is moving fast. It’s inevitable and there’s nothing I can do.

I feel like im  going to feel this way until I die. 

Like how can I “unsee” the truth? Like I grew up lying to myself about life (religion, afterlife) and once I was able to face reality for what it is it’s like I can’t not know that I’m finite.

That doesn’t change the fact that I still feel like I am waiting to die. I don’t even know if that’s the best way to describe the feeling, I guess I would say I feel like death is around every corner, and I’m just hyper aware of that fact constantly.

1698267433.0,A bit of hope.,"
In the past, I made a post where I claimed that life is ultimately meaningless and that nothing we do really matters. I was trapped in a nihilistic mindset, feeling lost and empty. But something changed along the way.

I started to realize that even if the universe itself is indifferent towards our existence, our own subjective experiences can still hold value and meaning. I started to cherish the connections I have with others, the beauty of nature, the power of creativity and the pursuit of knowledge.

I also faced and overcame some personal challenges that made me appreciate the fragility and preciousness of life itself. I choose to embrace the uncertainty of the future, to make the most of what I have today, and to strive for something greater.

In short, I'm no longer a pessimistic nihilist who thinks that nothing matters. I'm now a hopeful and curious human who sees purpose and potential in the world. I'm still learning and growing, but I'm no longer stuck in a bleak worldview that only brings despair.

After spending some time on the subreddit, I realized that it was not doing me any good. While it's understandable to explore and even embrace nihilistic ideas, I found that the community was often too fixated on the negative aspects of existence, on the futility of trying, and on the dismissal of any values or morality. It was draining my energy and creativity, and making me feel more isolated and hopeless than ever before.

Therefore, I decided to leave the subreddit for good. I hope that those who remain there find some solace, joy, or intellectual stimulation from engaging with nihilism or other philosophical positions. I won't judge them for their beliefs or their emotions, as we all have our own ways of dealing with the complexities of life.

However, I also hope that they can move beyond the limitations of nihilism and find other perspectives that can still be truthful, nuanced, and empowering. Perhaps they can explore existentialism, humanism, spirituality, or other frameworks that acknowledge the challenges of existence while also celebrating the possibilities of growth, love, and creativity.

As for me, I'm still struggling with my own existential questions and anxieties, but I'm no longer despairing or passive about them. I'm seeking out positivity, connection, and purpose wherever I can, and I'm grateful for the supportive communities that help me do so. I wish you all well on your own journeys, wherever they may lead you.",0

1698083578.0,Exstistential Dread,"Hey guys. This is like my third post related to this.. But I never get any replies, so here goes another try.. When I was a kid, I was raised as a Christian. So, although I didn't understand death yet, I knew that one day I would be able to spend eternity on my own slice of heaven with my passed loved ones. I didn't understand the idea of death, but I knew that my grandparents and parents are going to die one day, and I hated it. I didn't want them to leave me behind. When I was a kid, I remember watching movies like the lion king and the land before time, where the protagonist child's parent dies. After each of those movies I would walk up to my mom bawling my eyes out telling her that I don't want her to die and leave me here without her. She would always reassure me that her death isn't something that I would have to worry about for quite a long time, then she would distract me with some bs to help me forget about it. Then I would also remind myself that I will one day die too and see them in heaven. So that made me feel a little better. And, besides seeing my loved ones in heaven, I couldn't wait to get to heaven because the only thing that really interested me at the time was the universe, and everything in it. I had so many questions that I wanted to ask god. Anyway, throughout time I forgot about Christianity and death in general, because I was that naive young teen who felt immortal. Like death would NEVER happen to me. As I became an older teen I started to acknowledge death, but at this time I wasn't really sure if I still believed in God. But I still felt like death was still not something I had to worry about.. Anyway, it wasn't until I turned 27 that my mortality really slapped me across the face.. ""You are going to die one day, and there's probably no heaven or God and you will never see your past loved ones again.."" it made me nearly collapse on the spot. I never really imagined the possibility of there being just NOTHING after death. I always imagined a heaven or some spiritual realm. But nothing? Forever? I just couldn't fathom it. It is my biggest fear.. Then I realized that I had another fear.. Aging. I really don't want to die old guys.. For a couple of reasons.. 1) Throughout my life I've suffered from clinical depression and anxiety and physical problems like the prostate of an old man.. Which makes my sex life nearly non existent. So this life, so far, has been a nightmare. And I imagine it's just going to get worse with age. And 2) I am just expected to GO ON after the people who raises you are just GONE FOREVER!? I'd rather just die with them than continue on to die without them there to comfort me. And 3) I hate humanity. I always have. I hate human society, the needless wars we start, the way we applaud companies like Apple, nike, samsung, etc. Yet we know that their products are being made by SLAVES in sweatshops that are surrounded by suicide nets to stop the slaves from trying to jump to their deaths rather than continue their lives in slavery. And we are knowingly destroying our ONLY livable planet. And we are all floating on a rock in infinite space and what we have dedicated our whole lives to is.. Working.. 8-12 hours a day so we can make.. Paper.. Paper that we gave value to.. Just to grow old and hopefully able to retire and then just.. die and.. cease to exist..? I mean there is a whole universe out there to be explored and we instead to spend our lives over useless things like politics where we are never on the same page, money, who has the nicest car, or biggest house, etc. It all seems pointless to me. So I was hoping to die and realize that I'm not JUST a human, but actually a spiritual being that transcends this useless human body. So with all of that being said, I have considered suicide.. I know I SHOULDNT want to die by my own hand.. But now that I believe that after this life there's just.. Nothing.. I no longer want to be here. Everything feels so pointless to me now.. Does anybody feel like this, or am I the only one..? I just want some opinions
 That's all. Thanks guys",0
1698014718.0,Nihilism is non-dualistic as in neither good nor bad(maybe both),"I have been reading posts from this sub and the Existentialist subreddit where many people assign ""nothing"" to be ""something"" as in good or bad in a moral sense. My understanding of nihilism is that it is just as the Latin translation states ""nothing"". Logic says that there has to be ""something"" for there to be ""nothing"" but that seems more like an assumption due to our dualistic pattern-seeking brains. 

""nothing"" seems like such an abstract concept that we can't help but polarize it with there being a ""thing"". I think that intrapersonal subjectivity is how we assign nihilism as either good or bad like the concept of optimistic nihilism. I have never heard of the concept of pessimistic nihilism which makes me assume that nihilism is viewed as pessimistic to begin with. 

Do you think of nihilism as good, bad, neither, or both? Is nihilism a non-dualistic concept to you?

1697991228.0,A few thoughts about Nihilism,"Since a long time, I'm intrigued by nihilistic ideas, and after some thinking about it, I wanted to share a few thoughts about Nihilism :

It's clear that all things don't have inherent meaning, and one of the main reasons why people try to find meaning to all things is that we are programmed to try to find meaning in things, and the satisfaction of this ""need"" is considered to be vital for most humans, and it's probably why some people became delusional when they don't find any meaning.

One tactic to overcome this risk is to simply try to do something interesting, and since nothing has meaning, there's no occupation that is more or less valuable than another, so we can do whatever we want. 

Some folks on this sub don't seem to care about doing something (because nothing has meaning), but all the means to occupy ourselves until we die are equivalent, so there no reason to do nothing instead of doing something (and vice-versa). 


All a bunch of words just to say that we can do some things even if we know that there finally no meaning, and the pursuing of some goals, and the act of do something we enjoy, all these things aren't incompatible with Nihilism...

All this seems to point a way leading to Absurdism, which is an interesting philosophy, that have the advantages to be based on Nihilism, and to not look for any meaning in anything.

But to me… apparently, there’s a difference. I still feel sad. I feel like something is wrong. My question is why do I still feel absurd emotions?

It’s like my brain accepts nihilism but my heart does not??

Why am I crying so many meaningless tears as a nihilist?

My god, I wish I never existed.

But I can’t wrap my head around why I feel this way. Why can’t I just be apathetic to everything?

What’s the point of nihilism if I care about suffering that doesn’t matter to any living being in 100 years time????

It’s starting to make more sense to just become some anti nihilist and try and fix the world. Any means necessary. To stop the suffering.

1697670103.0,Nihilism = Freedom,"The problem with Existentialism is that once meaning has been built, that meaning often becomes ossified and loses any malleability; it essentially becomes dogma, a set of Laws.

Nihilism recognizes that meaning is never solid, it is always malleable and just a game -- like a sandcastle that shifts in the wind depending on the tides.

Some claim this makes Nihilism useless, no place to rest your head. They seek something more solid on which to build values, ethics, etc.

Have fun with that project, but I believe it is futile like seeking the true Religion. There simply is no solid ground upon which to establish meaning. 

But that doesn't mean that meaning can't exist for a Nihilist -- it just means we recognize and remember that the meaning we have constructed is a plaything, a toy, nothing to be taken too seriously, and that it can be easily discarded if something more interesting comes along.",0

1697605419.0,Nihilism is Freedom,"Nihilism is freedom due to its rejection of traditional value systems, moral absolutes, and the idea of there needing to be an inherent purpose.

Freedom from External Constraints: Nihilism rejects the notion of inherent meaning or external authority dictation how you should live your life. It frees us from the constraints of societal expectations, religious doctrines, and moral codes set by others.

Freedom to Define Values: Meaning is ultimately subjective and what you create for yourself (if at all). You have the freedom to define your own values and principles based on your own experience and desires. Explore and experiment without feeling confined by external dogma.

Freedom from Guilt and Shame: There is no higher moral standard. There are no moral truths. There is no objective basis for guilt or shame. Be liberated. 

Freedom to Pursue Authenticity: Explore your authentic self and desires. There are no predefined purposes or expectations. Seek out what truly resonates with you (if anything).

Freedom from Existential Angst: Life is meaningless so there is no reason to try searching for meaning or feeling there must be more meaning. There need not be a reason for why you exist. There are ultimately no answers to life’s big questions that society would have you believe need answering. Be released from the anxiety and pressure to find answers.

Intellectual Freedom: Nihilism promotes intellectual freedom by encouraging critical thinking and skepticism. Question established truths with inquiry and exploration.

1697584159.0,Nihilistic thinking is trauma,"Could it be true that many who find themselves to be nihilistic in their thinking are doing so because of difficulties in the past like trauma? 

I’ve been really fascinated with Alfred Adler, psychoanalyst that worked with Freud, (until he fired him) who came up with individual psychology. Here’s a little bit on (what I feel) highlights an important component..

Alfred Adler believed that psychological developments occur only when individuals have personal goals. According to Adler, human behavior is driven by the pursuit of goals and the desire for personal fulfillment.

Adler argued that individuals are motivated by their unique subjective experiences and perceptions of the world. He believed that people strive for superiority, which he defined as a desire to overcome feelings of inferiority and to strive for personal excellence. This striving for superiority is what leads individuals to set personal goals and work towards achieving them.

Adler emphasized the importance of understanding an individual's subjective experience and their unique goals in order to comprehend their behavior and psychological development. He believed that individuals develop their own unique lifestyle, which is shaped by their goals, beliefs, and values. This lifestyle influences their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

According to Adler, psychological development occurs when individuals set and pursue meaningful goals that align with their values and aspirations. These goals provide individuals with a sense of purpose and direction in life. As individuals work towards their goals, they develop skills, overcome challenges, and gain a sense of competence and self-confidence.

In Adler's view, psychological problems arise when individuals face obstacles or setbacks in pursuing their goals. These challenges can lead to feelings of inferiority, discouragement, and a loss of motivation. Adler believed that therapy should focus on helping individuals identify and pursue meaningful goals, as well as develop strategies to overcome obstacles and enhance their sense of self-worth.

Overall, Adler's statement suggests that personal goals play a crucial role in psychological development. By setting and pursuing meaningful goals, individuals can experience personal growth, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose in their lives.

This makes me think of one of my favorite Nietzche quotes: 
He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.

To tie this is with trauma/abuse, - I read Janina Fishers book this year on trauma and it was fascinating. I feel it really helped me to see people’s behaviors differently. I believe that so many have nervous systems that are disregulated and “stuck” in the past, dissociating, numbing and that makes goal setting difficult. Ifs difficult to focus on a why or even a how when we are stuck in fight or flight mode.

I’m not saying it’s all bad, just that I see it. I was just talking with someone earlier whose struggled with addiction all of his life and he told me he’s a nihilist. I’ve been clean for over a year and still struggle, but am working hard towards becoming more goal oriented. It’s extremely hard growing up in a home that never encouraged, sexual and physical violence, confusing and strange. It has long lasting impacts and would make anyone feel nihilistic.

Every star, every galaxy, every atom, and so on, everything will die and as the universe comes to an end, what remains of any concept or idea will be the last to go with it. This is transcendental nihilism in my understanding. It is nihilism completely pushed to its utmost conclusion before the universe eventually ends and nihilism itself goes with it.

1697399179.0,"fatigued by ""finding meaning through..."" whatever it is type of stuff","i posted this hours ago as a comment in a post on r/Existentialism (tho the second paragraph i just added here):

the inherent struggle perceived within the tapestry of reality is, in essence, devoid of inherent meaning; it is merely a subjective interpretation. I observe a common tendency in individuals to elevate their pursuit of ""personal growth"" or the quest to find a meaningful purpose as transcendent and sacred. This sentiment, however, often stems from a realization that their endeavors contribute positively to the societal fabric. This contribution, in turn, fosters an elevation in self-esteem and a sense of personal value. In contrast, those trapped in a perpetual state of chaos, resembling the metaphorical ""child man,"" often grapple with a lack of meaningful contribution to their societal milieu. This pattern is deeply rooted in our collective unconscious, serving as an evolutionary tool for survival through cooperation, value addition, and altruism with the hope of reciprocal assistance when needed 

&#x200B;

and i find myself fatigued by individuals who incessantly seek meaning through various avenues, projecting their solitary odyssey through existence with such declarations. It echoes the sentiment reminiscent of narcissistic religious adherents who attribute their suffering to a divine love and a concealed plan underlying the seemingly malevolent nature of reality. It's worth noting that this perceived malevolence is merely a subjective construct crafted by the conscious entity's interpretation of reality. ",0

if our universe slams back in on itself to create a new proto universe (previously the only reason for any hope that anything will ever continue) it will probably slam down into perfect balance.

so chances are, after this universe dies, nothing will exist, ever again.

and before you say 'that is what makes us special / gives meaning' it doesn't, it is what prevents us from having a meaning.

if the universe were to reincarnate, there there would have been a slim chance that it would have borne intelligent enough life.

1696989891.0,"Our World. Our Selves. Our social world determines our self. We can build any social world we want. At least, for the next line of selves.","The issue here is that we define complex behavioral traits by how they manifest in us as adults. Most of these traits are complex traits that we experience. They run through our brain/minds. That is, there is imagery, emotion, feeling, and even linguistic description that we give to them. We end up with a disjunction between societal definitions and what is actually being created by genetic material. It is a large disjunction. The analyzing of human behavioral traits from genetic material has been hopelessly flawed. At least, as the program has so far been laid out.

([A YouTube video](https://youtu.be/pSF1MPJS2qU?si=b4Y-6SyVM_LV2SEk)(7 min) where I say the same thing as below.)

Sexuality, gender, and pretty much everything about our selves is capable of being done completely differently. This is made abundantly clear with a simple thought experiment. If your DNA was put into a single sex society, that had no knowledge, no concept, and no imagery of the other sex, including in animals, what sexuality would you be? What gender would you be?

Your genes are cheap. We can build different selves out of our same DNA that would be radically different, robust selves. To do so, we would have to build radically different social worlds. We have to accept, as reflective beings, that we can build radically different social worlds. We are very slowly socialized into our environment. We very slowly become complex selves, full of all the thoughts and imagery that flow through us.

Let's say our sexuality was completely determined by pheromones. For all of human history, we just live our lives in particular societies and allow beliefs and definitions of sexuality to arise. We, our selves, do not desire pheromones. We desire bodies, behaviors, appearances, whatever you desire in people. That is, when we experience our sexuality, it is a complex mental and emotional phenomena. So, we figure out that the entirety of our sexuality is this complex mental phenomena laid atop pheromones. Scientists isolate these pheromones. They spray the pheromone on a hamster and people start having emotional feelings towards hamsters. That may be something you would have to do in an early age before a person attaches sexual emotions and imagery to humans. If the pheromone story was the case, and discovered, and we did this a hundred years ago, many of the discussions about identity and behavior would have been different. We would have been more willing to destabilize the structure of our selves and world. I think many people would be more willing to hold their self at arm's length. They would see the accidentality of how genes and non-reflective parents/society allowed for a non-critical world to be set up around their DNA. They would see more of the story of why they are what they are.

Though our actual biology is more complicated than the pheromone story, this is essentially what is wrong with putting many of our behavioral traits into genetic schemata. Our genes do not lead to the kind of social world and selves that we see, unless you want to argue some long term deterministic, dialectic buildup across history. We are reflective beings. We can create any social world we want. At least as a species or community. The study of heritability, twin studies, and evolutionary psychology have constantly hit their head against such a problem. The problem is not in evolutionary and genetic paradigms. The problem is in overstating and solidifying psychology and behavioral traits that have immensely complex components. Language allows for self-reflection and self-blossoming in fabulous ways. The programming of our brains by genes/environment is wonderfully complex.

Let me give another thought experiment. We are travelling on a spaceship in the future. The idea is that we have created a single sex society and environment (And make no mistake, though a thought experiment, we could do the fundamentals of this today). Let's go all males. This ship has an AI program and artificial womb technology that has stored millions of fertilized eggs (or we just finagle cells). These males are raised to be knowledgeable but we deny them knowledge of females, across all life forms. That is, they have no imagery of female bodies or the concept of female altogether. Let's say they have the same spread of male genetics as society today. What sexuality are these males? I am telling you, right now, they are not desiring female bodies. Evolution did not program brains that have imagery of female bodies. Evolution did not need to do that. Whatever genes do to create sexual desire, it is worlds away from societal definitions and personal experiences.

It is not good enough in this day and age to say that a trait is a combination of genes and environment. Behavior and identity traits are fundamental to our selves. If we are not telling a good story about how they arise, then we are failing to tell a baseline story about why we are the way we are. This also means that we have trouble analyzing our contingent social world. Taking these traits as part and parcel of our selves has created a givenness to our characteristics. On an individual level, as we probe our own thoughts, it makes sense that we experience these things as they are given. Academically, and for purposes of self discovery, we need to tell better stories. As reflective beings, we need to remind people that we can build any self and any world (within reason) that we want.

Just to sidestep this, I fully support LGBTQ rights. That does not mean we retreat into our selves and into our world. Given the difficulties of unraveling our programming by genes and environment, I argue that we should, generally, put knowledge attainment before reproduction of self and society.

1696952323.0,The question of significance to the universe is fundamentally flawed,"I believe that the question ""Are we significant to the universe?"" Is fundamentally flawed. It assumes a stance in which you project life on to the universe. I believe that nothing is significant or insignificant to the universe. I think the only things that value the concept of importance are living beings.

Living beings prioritize things. Your dog thinks you're important but doesnt care about the war going on on the other side of the world. Alot of people hope that theyll do something that PEOPLE a thousand years from now will remember them for. Not the rock thats been there a thousand years before them and will be there for thousands of more years. At the very least you're important to yourself because youre a living being that prioritizes things like every other creature.

I believe this projection of life on the universe is an artifact of humanities history of believing in God(s). In the past being important to God was important. Pleasing God was important but more and more people are realizing that the evidence of a God is insufficient. Yet our culture and the mindsets it promotes still havent broken away from the deeper concepts of God/projection.

If you dont believe me compare these two questions:
Am I significant to the universe?
Am I significant to God?

Now consider that the answer is you are not significant to God. How does that make you feel? You are not significant to the universe. How does that make you feel? They probably make you feel the same. Youll probably ask yourself if im not significant than why am I here? As if God/the universe conciously assigns roles to everything to achieve some grand mission.

I believe that absurdism and nihilism can be good stepping stones out of this conceptual projection but they can also be traps if you fail to see the flaws within the question ""Are we significant to the universe?""

Does anyone know of a philosophy beyond projection? If you have some suggestions plz lmk.

TLDR: The question ""Are we significant to the universe?"" is a projection of life on the universe that comes from humanity's historic beliefs in God(s). The only things that understand the value of importance are living beings. At the very least you are important to yourself.",0

1696844501.0,Maybe the source of my agony is the feeling that I am 'owed' one.,"This might not be directly related to nihilism but my question is rooted from conversations I had in this sub. 


**Question** :


**IF** I  believe that karma, God, or super power does not exist, then why do I have this feeling that after all my struggles, something good must happen to me?


**Why**:

All my life I have struggled, suffered and worked hard to become something bigger than I could. And I achieved many things. 


Along all of that, every single person that came in my life, I went out of my way to support them and make them who they never were  - by being there for them for years and years and even more so financially. Never expected even a tiny bit. Help them become independent. Had everyone's best interest. Just did things thinking that my purpose is to help my fellow humans. Forgave them. Nurture them. Selflessly care. 

Edit: I did earn some of these people for life. They care about me and are with me (in their own capacity).

**Lows** :

Today, through no fault of my own, I am at the lowest lows. I saw the worst in last 3 years. When the time came to bear the fruits, I think I lost it all. And I can't help but wonder why.


**Positive steps**:

In last 3 years, I have been trying hard to see it positively. I worked out more and more. Tried to take positive steps for my life. Stayed fully sober for 6 months in the lowest periods.


 I wrote and published an entire music album and told my story - just to make the best out of this bad situation. Tried to stay as optimistic as I can. But I can't help but feel the dread. It's exhausting. It's suffocating here. It does not make sense. 


Am I wrong to feel that it's a bit unfair..or like a victim?


**Hypothesis**:

My hypothesis is that I was raised in a religious environment, maybe that's why subconsciously I still believe that something good **must** happen now?


Maybe I have been trained to believe that if I go through the lows, one day, there is a hope in the end? Something positive will happen? 


Or that good things happen to good people. 


The ""negative"" characters in my story have it all good. And when I am not seeing that good in my life, I am feeling 'nothing matters'. Why do it again? Why do any of this? 


**Could you share any insights? Any personal stories?**


I am going to see a therapist too but I want to work on this out of curiosity.


*(I call myself an atheist , but this whole post sounds like ""why God why, I was your true servant"" lol)*


EDIT: My point is not that I was taken advantage of people. I am glad I did what I did. But I feel, I was also a good kind person - morally, ethically etc., have been action oriented (as far as I can tell): and THIS is how low I have to be??",0

There's no karma. No ""God"". No good or bad.
Altruism is how you fool yourself and help others fool themselves. If someone has wronged you, has been evil to you, it does not matter.



It's all random. 95% of it.
5% are your actions. And those 5% are dependent on random things around you.

So, to start off, I already struggle with depression and anxiety so life already often feels tiring and pointless but that’s not the extent to my feelings.

Mundane tasks feel meaningless and everytime I have to get up and go to school or go to work, I question what’s even the point to it if we all die anyway. Despite knowing this fact, I do fear death and I do want to have a “purpose” in life but as far as I’m concerned, no one does. I often tell myself that it won’t matter because one day, the sun will explode and kill us all. So even if we document human history, contribute to society, it could be wiped away in the blink of an eye. Due to this, life feels repetitive and holds little value to me. 

I grew up Catholic but I don’t believe in it. If god truly existed then why does his actions contradict what people say about him? He’s all-knowing, loves all humans yet will send you to hell if you disobey him. It’s stupid and I can’t understand why anyone would willingly believe in something so blatantly fake.

1696542813.0,Tips and tricks,"As a recovering nihilist I feel the need to shed some light on my experience with it.
I can’t speak for all nihilists but I think I have a good grasp of it and it’s effects.

For me nihilism in a nut shell is simply not giving a shit. Not giving a shit has obvious pros but very sneaky cons. The more you drink the koolaid you may start feeling better because of the lack of stress that is no longer negatively effecting you. Now the tricky thing is people can often confuse the lack of stress as “happiness” and that is far from the truth.

The lack of stress is simply boredom, and too much of boredom is obviously not good for you and can eventually lead to being unfulfilled and eventually, stressed out.

Now as nihilisms effects on happiness…yea sorry but it works both ways. If you are indeed taking big gulps of the koolaid then be prepared to stop feeling as much happiness as you used to. 

Hobbies that you really enjoyed will become less and less enjoyable to the point where you will eventually have no desire to to partake in them, which leads to boredom…see the trend here?

A nihilist, who claims to only have happiness or only have suffering, in my opinion, is not a true nihilist.

If your trying to use nihilism to escape suffering then I’m sorry it’s just not going to work out the way you want it too. Our brains are cleverly designed and have evolved to strike a balance between suffering and happiness. You can’t fight your own biology and win. If you are needlessly suffering for whatever reason, your brain will eventually throw you a cookie even if you didn’t work for it, just the same as a rich man that has everything will inevitably become chronically depressed. We are designed to earn fulfillment and from that fulfillment comes happiness. In order to be fulfilled, we have to suffer. 

It really took me a long time to understand that. When I was going through a bad marriage that crashed horribly I turned to nihilism to comfort me, and comfort me she did, but she also robbed me of my future happiness and it is a bitch to gain the will and keep the momentum of working towards goals that fulfill me when I have the black hole of nihilism trying to suck me back in.

Now the paradox is, you can absolutely believe nihilism to be true philosophically and not drink the nihilism koolaid. It’s not exactly being a true nihilist because your essentially not practicing it and that’s ok.

So be wary of nihilism, it is very powerful. I still hold it to be very much true but I know better than to walk the walk and I hope you understand that too.

1696472561.0,Non religious faith,"I feel compelled to point out to the extremely depressed people here that faith does not have to be religious.

I also want to define faith in a non-christian way. Because I think bad experiences with the church have really poisoned a lot of people's understanding of what faith actually is.

Faith is just belief. Belief without facts. Belief with incomplete data or no data at all.

As limited as we are by two eyes, two ears, and a physical body, we can never have a complete data set about reality. 

This makes faith a necessity. Not just in the ""modern"" world but in any world.

I used to think of faith in a completely Christian, religious way. I had to have faith in Jesus. Or God. And that was why I lost faith, because those myths and that social structure lost meaning to me when the people who gave it to me turned out to be hypocrites.

Since then, I've realized that by losing that faith, I lost faith in a lot of other things. I threw out my faith in people. Threw out my faith in nature. Threw out my faith in myself. Threw out anything that looked like a nonscientific Belief. Until I had nothing left because it turns out even science is based on faith in scientists and great men half the time.

You can try to not have beliefs. You can try to reject all morality and meaning. But ultimantly, that leaves you lost. Especially if you reject faith in yourself. If you lose the belief you had as a child that you could go anywhere and do anything and figure it all out. Then you're stuck. You can get that back though. Kinda feels about as stupid as asking Jesus into your heart, but more directed at your wounded inner child. That person still has all the magic they were born with, they're just buried under a cynical mask we feel we have to wear to fit in with the cynics around us.

1696442019.0,I think some of you guys need to hear this.,"After lurking and reading some posts in here for the last couple weeks it's become very apparent that the common approach to nihilism here is very unphilosophical. What a lot of you are referring to is nihilistic apathy and I hate to burst you bubble but in the 21st century this is an extremely common and mundane worldview. The philosophers that coined and predicted the coming wave of nihilism predicted that this is how it would present itself and made volumes of texts to salvage philosophical meaning.

Nihilism is not liberating, its debilitating.

Nihilism is not a philosophical destination, its a morbid realisation.

Let me clarify;

If you found liberation in the realisation of your own nihilism you've experienced an ironic twist of fate. In exploring your nihilism and meaninglessness you found something inside you that dares to exist regardless of nihilism. You've found the source of your meaning and can no longer call yourself a nihilist. Your subjective meaning has come forth but you give credit to nihilism and meaninglessness.

Nihilism is not a place to rest your head if you plan to wake up in the morning. There are no living absolute nihilists you must work to evolve your thought process. In the 21st century not many insist that meaning is an inheritance so why do you still feel hard done by? Put meaning in its correct location and grow out of the despicable pit that is nihilism.",0

1696241129.0,My Nihilistic View,"Life is a journey of continuous discovery, but what are we truly discovering? Are we uncovering some deep, underlying truth or are we simply creating our own version of reality? Perhaps the answer is somewhere in between.

As humans, we have a natural inclination to seek answers to the big questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning of life? But what if there is no objective answer to these questions? What if our search for truth is merely a human construct, limited by our own perceptions and biases?

This is the essence of philosophical nihilism - the recognition that objective truth may not exist. It asks us to question whether our understanding of the world is simply a product of our upbringing, culture, and personal experiences, rather than any inherent truth.

But that doesn't mean that there is no value to be found in the philosophical search for truth. Even if we cannot uncover any objective, underlying reality, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is still a worthy endeavor. It helps us to expand our thinking and consider new possibilities.

In some ways, nihilism can be freeing. If there is no objective meaning or truth, then we are free to create our own meaning and find our own purpose in life. We are free from the burden of trying to conform to some preconceived notion of what our lives should be, and instead, can live according to our own values and desires.

The human experience is multifaceted and that there is no single, simple answer to the big questions. It asks us to keep asking questions, to continue seeking knowledge, and to create meaning from within ourselves.

We are all insignificant specks in the vast expanse of the universe, yet we are capable of experiencing intense emotions, creating art, and exploring the mysteries of the world. Our existence is a fleeting moment in the grand scheme of things, but it is all we have. ",0

1696183095.0,All knowledge is uncertain.,"the idea is this: the more information you are privy to, the more the probabilities of something happening changes. The more knowledge you discover, the more wrong the original calculation becomes.

For example: generally speaking, the chances of a flipped coin landing on heads 100 times in a row is 1 in 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376.

But what you didn’t know before doing the calculation was that the coin was weighted in a manner in which it always landed on its head. So, is that probability still relevant? No.

This is a very obvious example. Point is that, we don’t know every possible force that’s exerted on the coin. More we know, less accurate the original calculation becomes.

But how about less obvious ones? For example, what if instead of the coin being weighted, the reason why the coin landed on heads 100 times was because the wind just happened to blow at a certain speed and frequency, that aligned with the different throwing pattern of the coin all 100 times to give us this result? Is it still that same probability? No. These times it’s much lower, no?

Furthermore, why stop at just the wind? Why did the wind act in that manner? Because of air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place to another… why is that? And eventually, after taking everything in consideration, every particle and every possible influence on the coin, you’ll get the answer. And the answer in the example is 1. The probability of something that happened (in that same exact manner) in the past is always 1 in 1. And as for things that didn’t happen… it’s always 0 in 1.

I.e., calculating the true probability of something happening would require knowledge of everything… in which case the probability would either be 1 or 0. There is no 20% chance of something happening In objective reality. It’s either 1 or 0. And one can not know anything with any degree of certainty, without the complete set of all knowledge.

Under this premise… no claim can be said to be objectively true. Because you lack the complete set of all knowledge, you can not be completely certain regarding the truth of any claim.

No objective meaning… but it also means that you can’t deny anything. You can’t deny that they is objective meaning or that any claim of objective meaning isn’t true because you don’t have the necessary knowledge required to make that claim.

A perfect form of nihilism. You deny everything until you can’t deny anything at all. 

Under this premises, there’s also no freewill. Since it follow a a predeterministic idea.

Lastly: yes, there are patterns that the world follows… general statistics can apply to wide array of different people. You can find all sorts of patterns naturally generating in the universe. Patterns that you can realistically predict using statistics.

1696059413.0,Nihilistic Imperative,"My argument is as follows-
1. Let the probability of the statement ""Nihilism is true."" being true be P

2. Since there is no consensus now, and since nihilism is mostly about the absence of evidence, P<1 and P>0

3. True outcome is either P=1 or P=0

If true P=1, there is no point in doing anything anyway, even if this is wrong it doesn't matter.

If true P=0, my crucial point is that expectation of more future information decreases the expectation of future P, as new ideas take time to come about, as people(or even AI like Chatgpt) get more intelligent/knowledgeable.
Even if true P=0 or true P=1  is unknowable, we don't know that it's unknowable, so it doesn't matter.

EDIT: Why does expectation of more future information decrease the expectation of future P?
For a general argument, if true P=0, the chance of a false negative P=1 is zero, its a contradiction by definition. It follows that future information would either be irrelevant or prove that P=0, so future P either stays constant or is zero, expectation of future P is less than current P.

Therefore regardless if true P=0 or true P=1, nihilists should:
1. Survive into the future so that (2) can happen
2. Gather more information/increase our collective intelligence to get closer to ""truth""",0

1695996027.0,Nihilism is NOT apathy.,"It's time I address one of my biggest annoyances with a lot of posts/comments I see on this sub.

I'm sure frequent-browsers of this sub have seen it before (and if you have not, check out [this](https://reddit.com/r/nihilism/s/3AjKwDXWeI) linked post, or [this one,](https://reddit.com/r/nihilism/s/o8e9QE8iIK) which are both older but still salient examples) - someone claiming that nihilists, because they believe nothing matters, should not do anything and resign to apathy. After all, if nothing matters, why wouldn't we?

And, if you're anything like me, this line of reasoning has irritated you to no end! Nihilism is *not* apathy. It is not defined by apathy, and apathy is not an inevitable byproduct of it.

Nihilists can and do still care about things. New nihilists often worry that they can't, and come here to ask what to do, or even attempt to tell us off (see linked posts), and the answer is always the same. You can still care about things subjectively! Just recognize that your cares and values don't matter, even as you have them.

For example, I can care about a personal possession. Maybe it has high monetary value, or it carries some sentimental affection to me. In my mind, it feels as if it has value, or perhaps even meaning. Yet, as a nihilist, I also recognize that it doesn't, and the internal mental feeling that makes me believe it does is an *illusion.* Yet, to avoid a fate wherein we cease to do anything at all, we should *live the illusion anyways,* while *simultaneously* recognizing that it is in fact illusory, and does not matter. It may seem illogical from one perspective, but when you realize that it's the best way nihilists can avoid apathy, it becomes logical from another perspective.

Apathy would be the destruction of us all. Nietzsche saw how nihilism, when headed along a course of apathy, could be such a destructive force - and it's part of why he tried to steer the world away from this version of nihilism. Therefore, apathy must be avoided, which is why the refutation of ""Nihilists are apathetic"" is so absolutely paramount. 

Nihilism would also be incompatible with human nature if it sought to suppress all human urges, desires, and values. Luckily, it does not have to do that. 

We can care, assign (illusory) meaning, and live life, all while knowing of (and in spite of) none of it mattering. And that is what we must do, as humans, if we wish to truly live.",0

 The things is if you have money you automatically fulfill the others because you can have women and food and also Contribute to GDP of nation/society. Also out of the Others only Money is called by the name Artha, others are Purusharthas (Meanings of Masculinity). Since money is Artha I believe it's most important.

1695640223.0,The Power of 'Nothing' over Logic.,"

*""But are we allowed to tamper with the rule of “logic""? Isn't intellect the 
taskmaster in this question of the nothing? Only with its help can we at all define the 
nothing and pose it as a problem—which, it is true, only devours itself.... But if we do not let ourselves be misled by the formal impossibility of 
the question of the nothing; if we pose the question in spite of this; then we must at least 
satisfy what remains the basic demand for the possible advancing of every question.... For the last time now the objections of the intellect would call a halt 
to our search, whose legitimacy, however, can be demonstrated only on the basis of a 
fundamental experience of the nothing....No matter how fragmented our everyday existence may appear to be, 
however, it always deals with beings in a unity of the “whole,” if only in a shadowy way. 
Even and precisely then when we are not actually busy with things or ourselves this “as a 
whole” overcomes us—for example in genuine boredom....We “hover” in anxiety. More precisely, anxiety leaves us hanging because it 
induces the slipping away of beings as a whole....The nothing reveals itself in anxiety—...Holding itself out into the nothing, Dasein is in each case already beyond beings 
as a whole. This being beyond beings we call “transcendence.”...*

**In this way the above thesis in its main features has been proven: the nothing is 
the origin of negation, not vice versa. If the power of the intellect in the field of inquiry 
into the nothing and into Being is thus shattered, then the destiny of the reign of “logic” 
in philosophy is thereby decided. The idea of “logic” itself disintegrates in the turbulence 
of a more original questioning...  But the question of the nothing at the same time pervades the 
whole of metaphysics, since it forces us to face the problem of the origin of negation, that 
is, ultimately, to face up to the decision concerning the legitimacy of the rule of “logic” in 
metaphysics.""**

Other than that I live my life according to my own understanding of things. This is also my issue with the depressive/optimistic dichotomy in nihilistic thought. If you're focused on your lived experience, on your life in the world dealing with and responding to real shit, rather than intellectual masturbation, then that dichotomy doesn't really exists. 

The majority of people can't organically occupy a *strictly* pessimistic or optimistic worldview.

1695603924.0,"Nihilism isn’t logical or illogical, it simply is.","I see some debate online from time to time, some people trying to assert Nihilism as either logical or illogical, the absolute truth of the universe or a meaningless bunch of nonsense that doesn’t hold together. Now as the title of the post suggest, well, i think it’s just a belief, it simply makes sense within itself and trying to dismantle it from the inside so to speak is entirely pointless. So. Instead let me offer up a more meta point of view. I will be upfront, i have my respective issues and some criticism on how nihilism is treated as a whole, (both good and bad) so i thought that if anyone had any thoughts about that it would probably be you guys. Anyways.

&#x200B;

Let’s pick things up from the start. Nihilism, like all things, starts with a simple truth, or at the very least something that can be fiercely defended, you can’t create objectivity out of something that is at its core subjective (that something in this case being the general experience of everything, from the world to reality to society, morals, you name it.), of course you can try to make an approximation that can be good enough, that’s why we have ""common sense"", but it pales in comparaison to what would be a truly objective perspective.

This is the basis of skepticism, but in contrast to Nihilism, skepticism leaves things there, it makes no statement, because if you can’t know then the only thing that is truly wrong is being too certain of something, you don’t know what you don’t know, so don’t assume too much and don’t discard anything out of hand either.

This is pretty great, it’s open mindedness personified, problem is that it in itself does not make a worldview and as individuals we kinda need that, we need to make assumptions about how the world works in spite of knowing almost nothing of it in any individual capacity. 

In contrast, Nihilism makes an ultimate conclusion out of this, it’s simply that there is no conclusion to be found, there is no inherent meaning to life, existence, the universe or what have you.

There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s a belief, a belief like any other and i don’t have any bones to pick with it in itself, but what i think is a little problematic is that people don’t seem to quite acknowledge their beliefs for what they are, granted that is true of essentially all beliefs in general across the board, but i think it is sometimes especially prevalent surrounding the discoure around nihilism, in my experience the nihilistic outlook is oftentimes almost treated as a form of revelation or realization about the universe, when it really isn’t any different than the other beliefs out there (at least in my view). I think it would be interesting to look into *why* that seems to be the case and look at such sentiments with a more critical eye, regardless if someone believes in Nihilism or not.

&#x200B;

My second point i’d like to look into a little is this.

&#x200B;

For a lot of people Nihilism isn’t such a bad thing in fact it can be quite positive, it’s the ultimate freedom, the freedom to choose and create you own meaning, but that in itself makes nihilism the ultimate responsibility. That is the one and frankly also kinda massive ""problem"" with nihilism on a more meta and less personal perspective, this responsibility can be a burden for someone who struggles to find any meaning in their daily activities and life in general, couple to that the fact that the premise of nihilism is exactly something that someone who finds little meaning in their daily life will believe in and understand, not just on an intellectual level, but also on an affective one.

And that, that right there is the relation to Depression and Nihilism. Nihilism isn’t making people depressed no that’s nonsense, but depressed people will be attracted and subsequently struggle with nihilism because difficulty in finding any meaning for themselves is \*exactly\* what depression is about. It’s the unfortunate reality about this philosophy, and i think it’s true that in some instances, this philosophy will have a genuinely negative impact on at least some people’s lives. The saddest part about that is that despite ourselves we largely can’t help what we believe in, what conclusions we arrive to, the only thing we can do is take a step back and consider the other options, but again, as humans we’ve never been good at doing that.

&#x200B;

So yeah, to make things short, the beginning and end of my point is in itself nothing really spectacular or unexpected or mind boggling, but it’s something incredibly important to remember regardless as it kind of is the beginning and the end of philosophy as a whole. ""All that we really know, is that we know nothing."" that saying in itself is something that we inevitably stray from to create worldviews, but i think it’s something we should never let out of our sight, it’s an anchor, the only thing that ever was that can be assumed to be true.",0

I look on the news and see a shitload of violence and gruesome sex crimes and pedophilia. 

And then I look at my COMPUTER and see that it is the most complex machinery ever known to man. Clearly, again the developers of the machine were not suicidal or depressed.

But what is the point of the computer existing? Well 2 main reasons:

1)To masturbate to hot videos and pictures.

2)To, ironically go on r/suicidewatch and talk about how life is existential HELL.

1695309318.0,Word of advice/suggestion for nihilists: get into bushcraft/homesteading/camping if you want to have any hope of escaping society.,"Every day there's a post about ""muh society bad leave me alone"". 

Honestly those popular bushcrafters and survivalists should target nihilists as an audience - ""The Nihilist's Guide to Bushcraft or Escaping into the Woods"" or some shit. Or nihilists should band together and form a nihilist version of The Amish or the Mennonites. 

The truth is, you can’t survive without society as you are. That’s a fact. If you left now, with no training, no studying, no experience, and no tribe members to fall back on, you’d die of starvation or exposure to the elements within a month.

As a member of industrial society, you don’t know how to survive outside of it through non-industrial means. You have no traditional bushcraft/woodcraft skills or knowledge.

You likely don’t know how to set up even a basic shelter such as a tarp or tent/hammock. You don’t know how to hunt or trap or field dress what you kill to avoid getting sick. You don’t know how to forage for edibles or what edibles are even present in your region. You don’t know how to find drinkable water or how to treat or filter water etc etc.

And keep in mind, many of those things you need to set up those basic things such as tarps require supplies from “society” such as good cordage (unless you know how to make your own from plant materials) like bankline or 550 paracord. You’d also need a gun, also made by and bought from “society” (unless you literally know how to flintknap stone and make primitive bows - not easy, even the stonecraft of far more primitive human species such as Homo erectus requires a lot of training to master). You need fire starting kits and systems (unless you know how to use primitive methods such as fire plough or bow and drill).

What I’m saying is, unless you grew up as a hunter gatherer and learned the traditional bushcraft skills and knowledge, you need society, like it or not.

So your one shot at escaping society is extreme self reliance and that requires extreme training and knowledge as well as some compromise with society - you still need to suck on it's teat somewhat to get off the ground. ",0

We're almost non-existent as far as the entity is considered. And yet we consider ourselves the center of the universe. Like the whole world revolves around our petty problems and boring lives.

But what about that N dimensional entity? Maybe it's also in the same situation as us. Just living inside the mold in a N+1 dimensional entity's house. 

Think about a micro-organism living inside a mold in your house. That organism probably thinks it's a superior organism and worries about it's problems and how to lead a meaningful life. But it's life doesn't matter. Nothing does. You could destroy it's universe in a second.

1695157651.0,"My experience with meaninglessness, formlessness and existential depression and realizations I've had","I'm finding it brings more sanity to embrace this feeling and way of thinking rather than treat it as a mental disorder or something that's wrong with us.

Some people will say it's depression, but this is existential depression not a chemical depression.  They are two different things.  I think it's just something that comes from awareness and realizing that just chasing highs in life doesn't bring fulfillment in life.  I was reminded of this today as someone I knew just died.  When you realize death can happen at any time, you realize how dumb it is to just be going through the motions in life, even if you feel good and have pleasure or drive in your life, you are still living like a mindless animal pursuing pleasure for pleasure's sake.  If you died tomorrow, how would you feel?  Was it all worth it?  

Personally, the pleasure I pursued for much of my life was the pleasure of listening to music.  It was the closest thing to finding meaning in life that I had.  A genuine passion.  And when I was younger, that was still exciting, but then it wore off.  I was also aware that I wasn't actually living and didn't feel like I was living.  

It all made sense to me when I was learning about people's experience taking a medication that helped stop their food cravings so that they would lose weight.  But not only did they feel less need to eat, but they also became less interested in pleasure-seeking pursuits like shopping or working out.  Having lost the compulsive drive to pursue pleasure, they had to now make more conscious decisions about what they wanted to do with their lives than be lead by compulsion.

The concept of the ""monkey mind"" also makes a lot of sense here.  I feel all these things that made me feel good or have fun were just distracting.  I still love music, but I approach it differently now, and it has a different meaning to me.  In decluttering my life, my mind and my sensory environment, I've found myself closer to having an idea of what can make my life feel less like nothing.  I have a closer idea of where my heart really is and what I want to try to pursue in life.  

I think a lot of people deep down inside feel the nothingness of their lives, and desperately pursue things to fill that feeling of nothing.  For example, they try to prove that they're somebody by having some accomplishment or by trying to be pretty or prove that they're talented or useful.  Then they can at least think their life is something or they are somebody even though they are empty deep down inside.  People also are often too busy to think and have awareness of the emptiness to even know what they feel, but that doesn't mean that they're saner.

One of the most enlightening experiences I've had with facing the formlessness of life is working a job where I simply greeted people at the front door to a store.  I felt like I was just watching my life pass me by.  It really wasn't just about that job but about literally having watched so much of life pass me by.  You just become more aware of it when you can see the nothingness for hours every day and aren't busy or distracted.  Although I've had other jobs that kept me more occupied and even entertained, I still find myself feeling empty and facing existential crises after work once I have a chance to check in with myself.  Because life for me isn't about being busy or happy all the time.  And anyone who tells me that it is, to me is a superficial idiot and I don't want their life advice.  It's a philosophy that actually disturbs me, to be honest.

One thing that's made it harder for me to pursue a life that feels more like something than nothing is my problems with brain fog, ADHD, complex PTSD, abuse and dissociation.  All that stuff made it harder for me to find direction in my life and took me further from myself, from knowing who I really am, where my heart is and what really brings me satisfaction in life.  It also led to having a life unlived.  But maybe sometimes it's when you lose everything that you have more clarity.  Well, that's another discussion to get into.

But honestly, I feel like our entire culture is manic and empty, and that's why it's so hard to make sense of life for the rest of us to find something to fill the emptiness.  Because the only examples we have of how to live life are bad examples.",0

Nothing in the world has inherent value—you must give it value.

1694931772.0,"The older I get, the more I realize that life is not worth living","As I grow older, I increasingly realize that life may not be what we were promised when we were children. It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

&#x200B;

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

&#x200B;

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

&#x200B;

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

&#x200B;

Of course, it's possible to be happy, but it requires finding one's path, having a long-term vision, making efforts, and being lucky. Nevertheless, I still feel deeply unhappy seeing that it is probably too late for me.

The things that make you want to see another pointless and recursive day. Imagine if it was stripped away from you? Imagine if it fell through your hands like sand on the beach? See, people have a myriad of copes to distract themselves until death. Video games, music, and movies/shows are copes. A girlfriend or wife is a cope. Having kids is a cope. Traveling is a cope. Your job is a cope. And of course, your drugs such as alcohol and cigarettes is a major cope. Why continue to live this life? Sure, you can blame it on survival instincts. Sure, you can lie to yourself and come up with reasons to keep living but It doesn't really matter what you turn your attention towards. The result will remain the same. Living and dying. Waking up to start a pointless day and going back to sleep and waking up to start the same day again and again. Yes, it's a cyclical process but you do it anyway. What else can you do with your pointless life? You need something to delay the inevitable. It's like a person who has cancer. They know that death will come at anytime but they continue to distract themselves because that is all they can do. We all meet at the same destination. Next stop is death! 💀⚰️🚂 when that day comes, you will see that whatever you did in your life, amounted to nothing! 

There is no scoring board on who lived the best life. Into the ground you go with the worms. 🪱💀 The graveyard is waiting for all of us. 🪦we were never in control of our lives. If you are in control right now then stop yourself from dying. You can't do that. Why? Because you have no control over your life. Continue to feed the body with nourishment to temporarily sustain yourself. You will experience death. It will happen to all of us. There is no escape. Our fates are sealed! It has been etched in stone. There is no stopping our fate. Even words and disagreement won't stop our fate. People will die and kids will be born into this world and grow up and die. It's simple as that. You can't change reality. However, you are free to remain a fool. You are free to play games with your mind to keep from going insane. nothing can be achieved here. Being rich and wealthy is not important to me. When you are rich and wealthy, you have more resources to play around with. You pretty much live a more comfortable life until you die. But when you get bored, then what happens? What if you grew accustomed to being rich and wealthy? you will get use to it. The feeling of pointlessness will creep in and swallow you hole!


We are all doomed to die. Consider yourself dead because it's going to happen anyway. When you see or hear people die, it's just a reminder that you will die, too. Death is all around us.

One meaning of life imo that is independent of religion is to simply live. Nature in itself is an inherent meaning/purpose of life and nature has led to you being born. It has given you an inherent desire to live with love and morals - that is HUMAN nature. As far as we know at the minute we could be the only truly self aware species in the universe. That means we could be the only beings able to study and apply meaning to the universe around us… and those who wish to simply live as though there isn’t a meaning are not necessarily right in doing so.

1694785040.0,Are most living nihilists not just absurdists or existentialists?,"I’ve never quite understood the delineation between absurdism and nihilism - it seems to me that continuing to live within a meaningless existence in which the only guarantee is suffering represents perforce an act of rebellion and therefore couldn’t it be said that all nihilists who have foregone killing themselves are absurdists, or possibly just plain old existentialists? 

Nihilism denotes a disavowal of any god or superstitious nonsense, so there’s nothing of that sort preventing a nihilist from killing themselves, and the only real barrier would be fear surrounding the potential pain and failing the attempt and wishing you were dead more than ever as you wind up invalided or disfigured.

Foregoing suicide out of concern for loved ones indicates that one has placed at least some value in the wellbeing of others which isn’t compatible with nihilism by definition. 

I have a colleague who’s labelled himself a voyeuristic nihilist, who sticks around to roast marshmallows as the world burns, but reading between the lines he’s a far cry from a nihilist, for even the act of living for morbid curiosity or amusement still seems incompatible with nihilism, at most he’s an absurdist but even then he seems like more of an existentialist since there’s a lot he does seem to genuinely care about even if he denies it. I’m not sure I’ve ever met a true nihilist or ever will at least not in the land of the living. 

The way I see it, even allowing oneself to experience momentary joy, laughter, awe, intrigue etc is tacit acceptance that there are things worth living for even if they hold no cosmic meaning and don’t hold a candle to the suffering. 

Or have I approached it from the wrong angle?",0

I was raised in an immigrant household and always found fulfillment in my achievements. I’ve always been an overachiever because I believed you get out what you put in. But now after graduating from a good school, getting my “dream” job, purchasing my first house I feel empty because I don’t have a partner to share it with. I know i sound ungrateful but I’ve descended into nihilism because all these things feel meaningless if they aren’t contributing towards a future family. I didnt accomplish these things just to be alone. I’ve done so much self work, trying out new hobbies, going to therapy, building strong friendships and supporting my family. But when i lay in bed at night and think about repeating life like this for another 30 or so years, it feels absolutely pointless. I used to quiet my depressive thoughts with retail therapy but it’s not even satisfying anymore cause there’s nothing I really need or want. 

I’m really disillusioned with love and companionship. I’m an attractive woman who has no issue getting a first date, but all the men I’ve cared for left me once they slept with me. I know everyone says not to let romantic partners determine your worth, but all of my friends have had at least one solid relationship while no one I’ve cared ever cared to call me their girlfriend. I’m a self proclaimed hopeless romantic, but now I just feel hopeless. 

I have loving friends and family who I know need me, but I just envisioned my life being different by now. 

Then I look at the world and how volatile our climate is with raging wildfires and floods happening more frequently by the day, the inability for the average person to meet their basic human needs due to the greed of the ultra wealthy, the resulting violent crimes and unrest because of our economic system, our societies obsession with facades on social media and worshipping the same people who only see them as cash cows for their empire, the fact that the US food system is poisoning us for profit, the loss of true critical independent thinking and I’m like what future is there for me to even desire bringing children into the world. Even if I got lucky and found someone who was a good partner, can I in good faith feel good about raising a child today? Not only are there more problems than solutions, but the problems seem to increase the more we peel back the curtain of the global market forces that control every aspect of our human existence.

No brain = no problem.

Frontal lobe looks for problem. (Because it loves to solve problems).

When you are thinking ""What is the meaning of life?"", it means your brain thinks that there is a problem (= Why I am suffering?) but since there is no problem (no meaning in life) it makes you suffer.

So what's my point ? My point is, the lack of meaning in life is neutral, the suffering indulged by nihilism is created by the brain (because it is bored, depressed, stressed...).

Boredome = lack of stimulation, dopamine
Depression = disregulation of serotonine/dopamine
Stress = adrenaline, cortisol

That is why animals doesn't commits suicide. (One argument is that they are too dumb to understand the concept of suicide but it is also because their frontal lobe is lower, they aren't looking for a problem/thinking).",0

More on, or maybe not. Nevertheless, I'm glad that they managed to compare ten thousand other studies and come to the conclusion that the correlation with genetics reaches 50% and higher, while with the environment it's 1%. It remains to understand that human behavior is an expression of instincts. And for this, you don't need thousands of studies; you need simple logic. Everything is determined. That's it. But people lack logic. They are emotional machines programmed to seek pleasure. Their consciousness in all its manifestations is an emotional machine; every thought is an emotion, and under the influence of these emotions, they begin to think that they are endowed with free will, that someone up there cares for them, or there is some purpose in all this absurdity. It's very pleasant; it's pleasant as to become a fascist under the influence of herd instinct and hierarchy, masturbating in your head about how you are superior, that your herd is better than others, and you are higher in the hierarchy. Without this nonsense in your head, which stimulates your brain with pleasant sensations when you think about some transcendence - the 'god spot' - the posterior cingulate cortex, which, if stimulated, makes you feel the presence of God, you would never start this absurd journey or would quickly realize that it's all absurd and mechanistic.

But it's worth adding that the difference between 'real people' and mere animals is that their brains can cut the connection with the primordial (though it never frees you from causality; all your behavior ultimately is an expression of the primordial), that their neurons can break free from the primordial stimulus and loop themselves (or under the influence of strong emotional impact, transform into something with a constant influx of emotions). What this frees you from is emotional epilepsy, allowing you to suppress other programs and freeing you from suffering, among other things. It makes you happier than the people around you if it turns out to be stronger than everything else in your head. In my case, it's the instinct of curiosity - simply jerking off to the comparison of structures and extracting common patterns from them; the brain gets high on how complex the pattern is. This became my path, freed from the simple pleasure of getting a dose of high, it eventually turned into something that understood that thinking with logic alone is pleasurable, grasped the essence, cut out a large part of unnecessary programs, and here I am, possibly one of the happiest people on this planet. It only remains to free oneself from all the other junk, except for two worthy programs.

Yes, I am not consciousness. I look into myself, as Buddha said, 'Now it should become clear.' Consciousness is just a center immersed in the seizure of the moment's sensations. A homunculus incapable of realizing what happened a millisecond ago. A part of the brain programmed to immerse itself fully in emotions. I feel, I feel, I feel. I am a perch, a perch, a perch. And then it comes to the conclusion that it feels. The scheme of its operation is simple - it chooses the most enjoyable option. Ultimately, all emotions and all sensations are illusions, and even pain is probably an illusion.",0

I have grown to dislike life itself, finding little to no enjoyment out of anything. I can’t envision a life for myself, I have no desires or aspirations. I have no purpose or meaning. I find no enjoy in life, only suffering. I feel that I care too much about the suffering, whether it be mine or in general. 

I have been depressed for years and have grown comfortable in it, almost liking it. I don’t even know if I want to get better anymore, because I only see suicide as a good option. I don’t believe that I can change. 

I cannot stand living, it hurts sometimes. I feel like I am stuck inside this vessel, this flesh, and it’s eating away at me. It haunts me even more knowing that no one will ever be able to understand my feelings and how deep they really go, since they can not really feel it themselves.

I am tired of people forcing me to go on living, like my life isn’t my choice. I am tired of living so that others mustn’t mourn or because of this idea that at some unidentifiable time in the future I might want to be alive. 

Healthcare professionals are terrible, mental hospitals are horrible, and pills/therapy are not working for me.

They're wrong

All atheism means is that we know we have physical limits to those things. God is not going to save the planet when we ruin it. He isn't going to make sure a bad person gets punished. And supposedly God is their reason for doing anything: He doesn't need anything from us. I wonder how they derive meaning sacrificing themselves for someone who can't possibly care

On the other hand, we have plenty of options for meaning. Meaning is a human construct. We created it. Does something have to last forever for it to be meaningful? Nope.

Do you have a family? Friends? Do they need you sometimes? When you come through, does it mean something to them? Or do they respond, ""I am not glad for your help. We will all be dead eventually""

You're alone. You will never find love. Do you work with other people? Do they depend on your work? Do you play some role in creating something? Do you create anything outside of work? Do you enjoy and find meaning in other things that other people create? Food? Movies? Video games? How about pure achievement in competition or recognition? Or strangers. Make someone's life better. Or make everyone's lives better

There are so many different options for finding meaning in life. The delusion is thinking someone assigned your life meaning, when we were the ones all along. Yes, you can't achieve everything, just like you can't fly. And that's ok. So pick a bunch of things and the odds are low that you won't feel some sense of fulfillment

I want to draw your attention to an [article](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/effects-of-beauty-found-to-run-surprisingly-deep-nyt) in the New York Times written all the way back in 1981.

This is interesting because it's an old article from 40 years ago that has a lot of insight into the social problems we face today. This was written by a female university professor.

When I hear people say ""oh, you're just an inkwell dude,"" I have to ask: is she an inkwell as well? Are you gonna call her one too?

The article reads:

""Minneapolis studies of physical attractiveness show that people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover, often with dramatic effects on those being judged. The findings suggest that expectations based on physical attractiveness can become self-fulfilling prophecies that may strongly influence the course of a person's life.""

Precisely. You might even say ""[determine](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063975) the course of a person's life.""

Most people are usually only concerned about how they're perceived by the opposite sex, but your [looks dictate other aspects of your life as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757567/).

When you say this out loud, [people don't like it](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7290948) because it goes against their core belief that [people are in charge of their futures](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/).

But looks indeed do strongly influence the course of a person's life. [Looks often trigger a chain reaction.](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.1.116) [One thing triggers another and leads to the ne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/)xt.

Looks are really such a major determining factor of [every avenue of life.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370)

I'm not saying you can't accomplish something great otherwise, but you'll have to be exceptionally talented and hardworking. [You'll have to work twice as hard to get the same chances and opportunities](https://humboldt-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/2148/624/ThesisFinal.pdf).

""Dr. Berscheid said the importance of physical attractiveness is growing and will continue to grow as increases in geographic mobility, frequent job changes and divorce subject more people to 'onetime' or 'few-time' interactions with others, in which they are judged on the basis of first impressions.""

[What she said indeed came to pass](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1908630116), but I'm sure even she was surprised at the [magnitude of it](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html).

""The psychologist, who has been studying the effects of physical attractiveness for the last 15 years, said the findings 'give new dimensions to Freud's statement that ""Anatomy is destiny.""'""

This was really insightful coming from her, considering that it's an article from 1981. She talked about these issues in the 60s, about the importance of looks, how it shapes other aspects of your life, how it'll be even more important in the future.

[And she was proven right.](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-019-0244-4#Sec10)

""'Genetic determinism is anathema to Americans, who want to believe everyone is born equal, with an equal chance for a happy life,' Dr. Berscheid remarked in an interview here. 'It's simply not so. The most important factors governing success in life are genetically determined: appearance, intelligence, sex and height.' She cited a continuing study at the University of Minnesota of identical twins who had been reared apart. The study, she says, is showing that 'genetically identical children turn out to be very similar even though they grow up in very different environments.'""

She almost nailed it. The idea of genetic determinism is indeed anathema to most people on earth, not only Americans. It's an uncomfortable idea. It challenges the validity of a lot of moral values and beliefs in society that comtemporary laws stand up on: [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/), [justice](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm#), [the belief that we're in charge of our lives and decisions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), [the idea that we are responsible for our fates](https://www.edcor.com/newsletter/jack-welch-on-pursuing-your-passion/), [the notion of objective right and wrong](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), etc.

The idea of genetic determinism brings a lot of these ideas into question.

[The most important factor is indeed looks](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/health/ugly-children-may-get-parental-short-shrift.html), first and foremost, which is genetics.

Then, I'd say opportunities and environment, rather than sheer intelligence, are the next most important. I slightly disagree with her here. [Which country you were born in](https://data.who.int/countries/426), [your race](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36347), [which family you were born into](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/research-generational-wealth), all of which are determined by luck.

Next in order, according to Berschied, is a person's sex. That is true, but it's the other way around. [It's girls who have a head start over boys](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X17302584).

Then again, she was born in 1936, and she grew up in the 1940s and 1950s when [women didn't have de facto equality](https://apnews.com/article/50fb651b7fb84221887f8a7534a87fff), so I'm gonna give her a pass here.

""The preferential treatment of physically attractive people starts right after birth, Dr. Berscheid noted, and continues throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. These are among the more telling research findings, all of which involved normal-looking people of varying degrees of attractiveness:""

Keep in mind that scientifically more airtight studies that came out in the last 40 years [not only confirm the aforementioned evidence](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30766-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218307668%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), but also show that looks are [even more important than previously thought](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092656621000131).

[The rabbit hole goes even deeper](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016363839890011X). A baby born yesterday knows that it's over for you.

This is beyond brutal, man.

""As women become more independent socially and economically, Dr. Berscheid sees them placing a greater emphasis on the attractiveness of men, 'who are now in the ""meat market"" just like women have always been.' She cited the recent advent of male centerfolds and male nude dancers as examples of women's interests in how men look.

Another factor has been the importance women today place on love as a criterion for choosing a mate. In 1967 only 24 percent of women questioned said they would marry only if they were in love, but a decade later, 80 percent said 'being in love' was a necessary condition for marriage.""

She really saw it coming considering that she was born in 1936 and grew up in the 1950s. But even she likely underestimated the [effects of looks](https://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf), [the invention of dating apps](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2087), and [more](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/02/SDT-Intermarriage-II.pdf) in the new millennium.

""'When romantic love becomes an important factor in social choice, physical attractiveness becomes important also,' Dr. Berscheid told a symposium on the psychological aspects of facial form last year. The symposium brought together plastic surgeons, dentists and others who produce facial changes that often affect patients more powerfully than the functional defects they correct.

Sometimes patients react badly -'with pain and bewilderment' - to significant improvements in their appearance, Dr. Berscheid told the meeting at the University of Michigan. This reaction could result from the realization that **we are not just loved for ourselves but for what we look like**, she suggested.""

This is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people.

""Dr. Berscheid believes there is a hazard inherent in denying the impact of physical attractiveness: 'Unattractive children who are unpopular may wrongly attribute their lack of popularity to some flaw in their character or personality,' she says. Such an error, she believes, could result in lasting and painful scars.""

[Again, she nails it](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373). It happens all the time. [Which is why a lot of naive men fall victim to PUAs and redpill scammers](https://jacobin.com/2023/03/andrew-tate-capitalism-scam-misogyny-alienation-hustle). Those guys blame themselves: ""oh, I must be doing something wrong,"" when [it's usually about their looks](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/howyourraceaffectsthemessagesyouget.html).

**Anatomy is destiny, and you can't really fight destiny.**

1694008536.0,Meaning and economics.,"A while ago I've got a job, and with it came a pleasant irrational feeling: a feeling of doing something of value, of being meant for something, in a sense.

It's not that I wanted that feeling, it actually has surprised me, that it exists. The job itself isn't particularly inspiring or profitable.

One feature that may be important is that I'm not ""alienated"" from the results of my work, I see it solving problems of other collegues in the real time.

Now everything starts making sense: why people prefer creative jobs, why employers boast about company ""mission"", why some even spend resources and time to volunteer. Everything points at the feeling of purpose being a thing of value.

How much value is in it? Can some sort of job make people feel less miserable about meaninglessness of life? What do anti-work folks think about it?",0

Everyday I wake up and relive the same shit over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, i feel like i’m going crazy. Same conversations. Same people. Same work. Its just all superficial shit. None of it matters anyways. We grow up, go to school, work a 9-5, start a family, then die; the result? Absolutely nothing. Endless suffering. Your loved ones either die or leave you, and all you have left is yourself. And the only thing existence brings is to feed into the capitalistic money shark society that we live in. 

Went through the worst heartbreak of my life, and ever since then I have no interest in anything or anyone. I have a lot of friends but I have no attachment towards them, they all leave anyway.

1693926396.0,Unusual Philosophical Question While Watching an Adam Sadler Movie,"When I was a kid, I watched alot of movies.  My family was particularly fond of comedies which included Adam Sadler movies. 

There was a movie my mom loved, called ""Fifty First Dates"" with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sadler. This movie always made me feel uneasy, and I didn't know it at the time, but it would eventually give me an Epiphany. 

Still a child, I wondered what it would be like to be Drew Barrymores character. Someone who had been in a car accident, resulting in short term memory loss where you reset every 24 hours. 

Let's aside the creepy notion of waking up everyday in unusual situation forced to face the fact your pregnant, older, with strangers and your dad's dead. I was more preoccupied with the thought of what her experience was like in the car accident. 

So here's my question, If you lossed your memory everyday, and the last thing you remembered was the car accident, did your consciousness die? Are you but a walking corpse waiting to expire? 

You wake up with no memory after that, you go to bed and what you did that day dissappears. Now, Drew Barrymore says she sees Adam Sadler in her dreams and writes it in a journal. But that's the body talking yeah? She has to record those dreams, she doesn't remember those dreams the next day. Is she stuck in purgatory? 

The last memory she will know is crashing in a car, from her point of view, she will die and that's the last memory she could remember. So did she die back then? And if you can lose that memory, and not experience more from then on, what makes life meaningful if you can still live and not remember any of it? 

I've always centered this question as the reason I got into philosophy and found solstice in nihilism. I believe if I was in that car crash, the drive with my dad would've been the last thing I saw before entering the void. The rest was my body operating itself.

1693879276.0,Psychological bias about nihilism,"Through several introspections, I've come to realize that when my ideas turn nihilistic, it's often during psychological impasses, moments of indifference, when everything seems futile. It's as if my brain resorts to this as a defense mechanism when my emotions (anxiety, guilt, hatred, frustration, sadness) become so overwhelming that they can't be countered. Normally, the lack of meaning doesn't bother me much; it's a mild desire, so to speak. But when I'm in a state of depression, I feel that lack intensified.

I can see my emotions and the thoughts they've spawned. Intense guilt led me into a determinism mindset (making me believe I had no other choice, so not my fault, hence indifference). Strong anxiety made me think that nothing matters in the end, that everyone will be forgotten. Depression convinced me that we suffer for nothing, so the rational choice would be to die.

Then, when I start to feel better, these thoughts I've created (guilt = determinism, anxiety = don't care, depression = don't matter) ultimately turn against me. It's as if nihilism has this duality of positive/negative outcomes.",0

I’ve never gone through such a consistent back to back cases of misfortune and shitty events than I have these past few months, but I’ll just fast forward to more recently to make a long ass story just long. Having to live with my “friends” after I got kicked out by my mom we arranged on me helping out on rent, least I could do ofc. Well a week before the actual rent was due my tire literally blue out so I ended up having to pay for roadside assistance and a new tire. This ofc fucked my savings up so I ended up late on my share of the rent, understandable as it is to be frustrated at late rent I’d think my friends would understand it was a situation of an unfortunate event I had no control of and not me just simply not wanting to pay rent.

This didn’t stop my “friend” from telling the others in my friend group how I’m just this freeloader that’s not paying my rent, going around giving me a bad name when he knew exactly what my situation was. This month I was on time despite another incident of my car being repoed (I was behind because our landlord fucked us over and I had to literally take out loans to help with moving expenses and a down payment on the new place when I was living with my mom). I’m visibly stressed at the possibility of my car being auctioned off, still having to go to my retail job, and having to come back to my “friends” shitting on me on a game chat behind my back about me “not paying my bills” etc etc. All of this on top of me still recovering from a nasty falling out with the only parent I had.

This summer has fucked my mental state up and I truly feel alone on this. No one close to me cares they’d rather just laugh at my expense. Best believe once I get my shit together and move out in cutting these people off completely. This was a learning experience for me, trust no one.

Of course I put meaning to things, probably a necessity and keeping myself entertained, when you think about the basic idea (psychologically).

1693814523.0,Do secular Zen Buddhism contradict Nihilism? Nihilists were destroyed in India. Zen is Nihilistic.,"I think Zen and Nihilism doesn't necessarily contradict each other except Zen advices you to cultivate Emptiness of Mind. Why? Because we have to face life so we should have ability to not worry about everything trivial. Since it's an active path and so Buddhists will deny it as Nihilistic. 

Another reason is Buddhism spread with the support of Ancient Indian Kings like Ashoka The Great and he converted to Buddhism from Hinduism to gain political advantage and killed many minorities including a Nihilist philosophical school. It proves that being a Nihilist school means Indian kings will come for you at that time. Also some scholars in Ancient India probably complained to Kings that promoting Buddhism will ruin the Economy.
 I watched a video which mentioned that Kautilya, famous scholar, banned people from religious activities and forced people to raise economy than waste time on Gods. He only allowed Religious rituals as it improved trade compared to sitting in meditation doing nothing. He advised kings to restrict Buddhism more because Hindus were contributing more to GDP. But Ashoka probably saw Buddhism as advantage and rejected Kautilya.

This information is subject to bias because I received them from YouTube videos and Indian history videos can have political impact.

Overall, I believe Buddhists subscribe to meaning in life because people always rejected nihilism and killed them. In India, it was not Theism vs Atheism but Nihilism (Nastika) and Non-nihilism (Astika). Every philosopher tried their best to explain why ""we are not nihilists"" as the debates took place in King's royal court. Buddhism could not have survived without rejecting Nihilism.",0

Religions try to give things a point - you live, and if you live the correct way you will end up being ""happy"" forever.

Being ""happy"" is the conclusion that your brain reaches when the stimuli to which you are subjected are parsed by your neural circuitry and releases neurochemicals that you interpret as ""being happy"".

It is completely unknown if you have nerves and neurons in any religious concept - they don't talk about it. Nobody claims to know if neurochemistry exists in some form in ""heaven"" or ""hell"". But for you to be happy, at peace, or in misery and torment you must have something that processes whatever environment you find yourself in and reaches a conclusion of it being pleasant or not.

Everything is delusion from the get go. 
Body dysmorphia to a minor degree is rampant enough to be a feature of our species. And no one likes the sound of their own voice. We ignore ourselves and project on to the primer what we deem reasonable if one is a reasonable person and project insanities and eccentricities at the extremes. 

We define our lives not by what we see around us, but by the movies we watch and the books we read. By the fantasy we have decided to play out. 

I’ve found the problem with marriage is they’ve seen too much of you for there to be any mystique left. You lay bare, a nothing. This is worth the loss in my mind, as you form a symbiosis of sorts. Which provides an advanced comfort. But also is probably why I require a bevy of girlfriends I can enchant for a year before the inevitable breakup when the spell wears off and they get tired of a bitter alcoholic writer. 

Life is romanticism and I should know as I’m in the romanticism business. Find me the writer who writes as close to reality as possible and I’ll find you the driest writer in the room.

1693461781.0,Is feeling good intrinsically meaningful?,"The one thing that challenges Nihilism for me is that our desire to feel good seems hardwired in by the universe. You can say that ""happiness and love are just chemical reactions"" but that means any materialist has to admit that dead inert materials like chemicals are creating intense desires. You are a bunch of inert materials having feelings, aren't you?

As nihilists we say that the universe doesn't care how we feel, but if we are just bits of the universe moving around, not separate from it, then it's the universe itself that wants to be happy, in the form of humans and animals.

Larger trends in the universe that cause change, like gravity and electromagnetism, are the same forces causing the chemicals in our brains to desire happiness and good feelings, and those good feelings are the result of more complex thoughts like, ""I completed what I wanted to complete"" or ""I am fitting in to the social environment.""

This would suggest the universe is attempting to move towards a certain state of existence, but has become scrambled and divided up. Each individual piece of it is trying to reach internal harmony even though that pursuit disrupts other parts of the universe, actions and reactions bumping around causing disharmony to continue on timescales far beyond our awareness.

So this would mean that our core desire to feel good was intrinsically meaningful. A small representation of the overall pull towards a stable harmonious state that the universe is attempting to land in.

1693408125.0,Finding Purpose in a Deterministic Universe,"I saw a post earlier about the deterministic universe. I thought I share this blog post that speaks well to me.  

  
**Finding Purpose in a Deterministic Universe**

When we act on our biological instincts, desires, and programming, we are merely objects—subjugated by a broken society in a deterministic universe.

In the ego development process, we initially identify with ourselves but eventually move towards a sense of universality. This means our compassion and interconnectedness expand to include more members of our species. Our collective species also undergoes its own stages of ego development. Individuals who wield power influence this direction. Other mechanisms, such as industries and organizations, also play a role. Despite this, a structural problem persists where the most corrupted individuals wield the most power. Collectively, our species has maladapted to its crises.

One avenue to elevate the collective ego development of our species is by enhancing individual spirituality. In this context, I associate higher spiritual levels with more advanced stages of ego development. As an individual, you are subjugated by both a flawed society and a deterministic universe. The journey towards finding your authentic self is an act that defies the deterministic nature governing us.

However minuscule, when you embark on this path, you defy the determinism that governs us.

Indeed, we do live in a universe that is indifferent to us, but within that framework, we, as part of the human collective, are actively charting our own path. 

I don't know; to me, it's difficult to find meaning while being part of a collective (our species) that is so dysfunctional.   


Below is the intro to the article. 

&#x200B;

**Evolution mirrors time itself.**

&#x200B;

Evolution mirrors time itself. It is related to the process of spiritual awakening. Inefficiencies in our biological neural network accumulate due to maladaptive programming. Spiritual awakening triggers a rapid integration process, exposing and re-coding these maladaptive traits as we become our higher self. The act requires us to break through the matrix, re-evaluating and consciously changing our hierarchy of values. Collectively, this process makes our biological neural network more efficient. The result is an enhanced ability to process information. Spiritual awakening leads to a profound evolution within the self. This transformation heightens awareness and mindfulness, altering the way we perceive time as if time is moving more slowly. The spiritual awakening represents an evolutionary shift.

And the only way to align yourself with this absolute truth would be to have a subjective reason internally, because even if there is this truth, which dictates what is right, you still have to go over the question: Why do what is right? And the answer to this question will always be subjective, it's what connects the person to this supposed truth. The reason may be wanting to be right, wanting to act according to the truth, which are reasons that, different from the absolute truth, could still be questioned (vulnerable to infinite regress) and therefore without foundation. Since we live in a world that lacks intrinsic meaning the same thing goes, what governs is the subjective. All choices are subject to the subjective and it is impossible to make a non-subjective choice, therefore they are not rational.

Nihilism determines an absolute truth, which is that there are no absolute truths, so someone who aligns with this philosophical position has an adjacent subjective motivation, which is subjective, falls before infinite regression and therefore has no foundation, it is a lie , an illusion. Realizing it, the person realizes that the search for truth (their subjective motivation) is a lie, a deception. But the person, when trying to stop practicing a lie that would be the act of seeking the truth, he begins to look for ways to get around the situation and leave the lie to seek the truth, but in this he is back in the search for the truth that is a lie, how to get out of this dilemma?",0

I like her but we're not even close and we're really different. She hitted on me whereas I wasn't even imagining it.

Since the beginning of the thing we agreed on a open non exclusive relationship. I didn't have any issue with it, why the fuck would I care if she wants to fuck other men? As long as we're safe and she doesn't brag about it it's fine. At the end it doesn't matter right? 3 months later I grew to care about it for no intelligible reason. I'm thinking about how she's spending time with other men that are better than me and I end up frustrated when we don't have sex. I'm masturbating a lot more than beforehand and I even look for new hookups, which I never did in my life.

I felt so damn more peaceful before experiencing this nonsense. It truly feels like it's just a mix of gut feelings pumped by hormones.  
Evolution programmed us to react like this. It has probably nothing to do with my relationship. It has to do with how I'm supposed to keep other competitors away from my mate. Making sure your mate is exclusive to you is how you maximize the chances to propagate your DNA. There's no reasoning behind this.

I never felt so close to an animal. If it was easy to supress the bold effects of some hormones I would do it in a heartbeat. Feeling nothing is bliss.

I do think that things matter at the end if the day, but I'm so detached from reality and I genuinely have a dislike for the human race. I've been suicidal since middle school, since a child, I've watched my parents fight and argue, and i remember specifically, that period of time made me question people. I didn't understand them. So I throughout the years I've just been asking questions, finding answers that lead to even bigger questions.

I always had an interest in psychology. I was always in tune with my own emotions and the more information I obtained, the more deep into my subconscious I went. I have face my shadow self and still fighting with him to come to terms with how I want to go about life. I'm at a point where I could either be an unambitious hermit with nothing but knowledge and perspectives to give, or I can try to make something of myself and establish my name in the world, but at what cost.

Having to take care of your body, look after yourself, all of it is a chore for me. I want to get away from it all. A lot of things people find important, I either don't care about, or I'm indifferent. That's why I'm anxious to want to try and make new friends. I'd rather just stick with the people I know. I feel a bit scared to share my opinions and thoughts with the people of today cause society's gotten so sensitive over the years. It's ok to care about other's feelings, but people align their identities with certain beliefs and ideologies, to where if you disagree with them, you are attacking who they are.

That's why politics are dumb af. It's a form of segregation. One side stands for one, and the other side stands for that. So if you don't vote for one side, you are immediately *AGAINST* the other side. This is why the world will never know peace and acceptance for all walks of life and people of different discographies. 

The internet would rather cancel or bash someone instead of helping them become better. We condemn people for having certain beliefs, voting for certain people, expressing themselves a certain way, we might as while go back to segregation. All the LGBT over there, all the heteros over there, minorities over there, and non minorities over there. Left handed over there, right handed over here. Maybe then we could stop the constant bickering back and forth. But where does that leave people like me who associate with many things? Or simply don't care. Why can't people just be. If you dont like something, stop centering your attention around it. Ignore it. Detach.

I always had the thought of living outside of society. Away from the barrage of social media, politics, racism, violence, all of it. I just want to be around trees, water, nature, the sun and moon.

""Eventually you're gonna die whether by sickness or natural causes, and no-ones gonna remember you and u wouldn't be there anymore to remember all of those failures and successes in your life you wouldnt be there to remember all those embarrassing and prideful moments of your life, nothing matters and there is no good nor evil here, there is no such a thing as shame or pride only suffering"",

1692843681.0,"so as everything is determined all your behaviour goes from instincts, seems consiousness is a lie, at least people minds around absolutely delusional and they work on instincts especially hierarchy, so","people read your emotional state like animals just by outcomes in the end subconsciously, all your behaviour in the end expression of instincts(yeah there is a next step, when part of brain cuts itself from instinctual root and you start working like on habit without original reason, but it don't free you from casuality really, you just forget, but you grown from instinct). anyways symbols connected, all nazi, racists, loves swastika, not just common ones but any like ""colovrat"" for example and similar with square ends and they pretend it's just beautifull(just make a research, you will see great correlation), most gays and womans love guro, all interconnected and a lot of other stuff connected, everything is connected.

that's why some shizos love to say that everything in your mind. the thing is you really define by yourself your status also, as everything interconnected your instincts connect your status with money, proffession, intellect, strength and your working in instinctive society with hierarchy and expressing your behaviour, surrender or be a master.

really it's a hierarchy instinct - slave/master. goes from the start - expansion - conquering - humilating. nature defines the best ones who is better at humilating, womans love the best ones. nature made a trickiest trick here, so we don't kill each other in neverending pursue for expansion, just by surrendering(subconsiosly), and the greatest trick it made you not understand it.

so you just need to be confident, control your fear, hierarchy instinct - slave(gays, womans)/master(mans with aggressive voice intonation for example), i mean you really need to be in control, you even can not understand that this programs enabled, you will know when you in control for example when most of the dogs will not bark at you, like you see dogs bark at most people and then you go and they stop, people will like you, womans will be interested all around.

that's how psychos works, they absolutely confident in themselves, thinking they on the top of world, they have supressed fear - that's why people just love them and going to die around some of them trusting them - going with them to silent places, their homes, e.t.c

a lot of things hard to explain really, i just don't even know from where to start, and the thing is your mind emotional machine in delusional state that loves to think she is special, loved by god, have free will, and e.t.c.i just working on curiosity and empathy instincts, grown from it. for example i made a promise to my mother in childhood really seeking her respect, attention. but i'll never get that reward anymore, but that program works till the end. that's why i understand, cause this programs derived from instincts stronger than others. a lot of nature programs in your mind messing with each other(Heraclite thesis-antithesis really which Hegel stolen), eventually if you don't get me at all, you probably weak.

1692742323.0,Are we born just to suffer?,"We come into the world crying.

Life is very hard, for some people more than the others.

We are basically forced to suffer, doing things we don't want to do, so we can escape from a greater pain.

I'll give you a simple example.

Toothbrushing my teeth is painful (in the sense I don't want to do it) and yet I must do it cause toothache is more painful.

People get addicted to other people, to drugs, to internet, cause they're constantly seeking for pleasures, so they can escape from sort of pain, like boredom for example.

We must satisfy our needs or we get irritable, frustrated, in the worst cases we could die.

We want to become rich, so we can get a more pleasurable life and suffer less.

I don't think humans were born to be happy.

I am not saying you can't feel good, of course you can, but it's temporary. 

Even successful people are not happy, despite having a more pleasurable life.

Pleasure is fake happiness.

My point is that life is good only when you're escaping from reality and pain, so basically, when you're getting pleasure.

That's why, people in jail are depressed for example. All they do is stare at a wall.

the only thing that lends any sense of value or purpose to us, the only thing that pushes us out of bed, is a fear of ramification. even the most forward-thinking, self loving individuals, are motivated only by the knowledge that, should they allow themselves to lose their momentum, then they will inevitably find themselves in the bitter soup of unfulfilled dreams. a life, “unlived.”

but if we were stripped of our struggles, our aspirations would be ripped away as well. our joy is borne out of our experience with the alternative. art is a byproduct of pain; every advancement came only by virtue of the deaths of the hundred billion people before us, as their deaths taught us how better to care for those still alive. never to suffer, guarantees that we will suffer until we die, even if it is simply from tedium.

have you ever wondered why you might be doing nothing more than sitting at your desk, but your anxiety levels are that of someone being hunted for sport?

do you wonder why the prospect of getting out of a nice clean comfy bed and stepping into the world yet another time, is sometimes paralyzing?

i don’t know why i’m phrasing this like an infomercial. really, the point i mean to make is that it likely has nothing to do with your innate senses of “motivation” and “drive”. these are manufactured feelings, which came into existence in the absence of natural predators. the greatest virtue one can aspire to is to become utterly enmeshed in the horrible tedium of 40 hour weeks, lewkwarm wages, and decades of grinding. with the promise of course being that, if you do not have a heart attack beforehand, that you might enjoy 15 to 20 years of elderly leisure.

no wonder we all fucking hate it.

 therefore, i think therapy isn’t, as it claims to be, a fundamental reworking of a damaged psyche, into one that is more at peace with itself and with the world. nope. i think that might be true in many cases, don’t get me wrong, but for others, who are simply stripped of time and joy, i think that the practice of psychotherapy is an ineffective and worthless salve. verbal snake oil. sure, maybe the reason you cannot stand the mind-numbing anguish of working 30 percent of your life away (at minimum), is because of some deep-seated trauma you experienced somewhere along the road, that your brain has packed into a corner and vowed never to think of again. OR, maybe the reason that we are incompatible with the lives we live, is that those lives are a stupid little charade, and that we are constantly being tugged on by instincts that do not make any sense to us. maybe that pen-pushing psychiatrist is just playing a guessing game, stretching it out for a few months so he can make as much money as possible, when really the answer might be as simple as “the reason you aren’t happy is because this world was not built with the chemical joy of its participants remotely in mind.”

therefore, it would seem, the only way for many of us to experience real joy is to not participate in the prefabricated life plan that so many people follow. so, like, become a park ranger or something. or write a book. doesn’t matter! you are made out of meat.",0

Do you agree or disagree with me?


Intelligence is just another trait (aka feature, aka niche). It is no different than the long neck of a giraffe, or the speed of a cheetah, or the halophilic abilities of certain bacteria, or the photosynthesis ability of plants. The only reason you think intelligence is special is because that's the defining trait for your species and because in a meta way intelligence itself makes you think its superior to all the other traits.

If you think intelligence is special, then humans, as the most intelligent species on Earth, must be special. Given that, what are the chances you were born in such a special vessel? Either god exists, or you specifically are being simulated, or you are just wrong.

To extend this thought further, there is nothing special about life, it is just another emergent process in the universe. There is nothing special about computers or artificial intelligence, also just another emergent process. There is no process in the universe that is more special or significant than any other process - they just are the way they are.",0

1692545846.0,The affect of the service industry on our mental health,"In the last few decades, there has been an increase in the amount of people turning to mental health services. People usually say the reasons are wage stagnation, rise in cost of living, the abandon of the traditional family model, loneliness resulted by long working hours, housing crisis, etc.

but there is one thing no one ever talks about that can actually be the leading cause for it, and it's the transition from agriculture and manufacturing industries to the service industry. The explanation is quite simple. People deal with mental health issues because their jobs are mentally demanding, just like people in the 1800's suffered from physical conditions for working in physically demanding jobs. It's an industry that involves lots of mental violence, humiliation, harassment, insults etc. After getting insulted so many hours a day so many days a week, workers are more prone to make mistakes that cost the economy lots of money and contributes to their decreased feelings of self worth. 

I don't know how viable it is, but I think that in order to solve the mental health crisis, the western world should find a new industry to revolve its economy around, or, pass labor protection laws in the service industry, so the workers aren't completely exploited.

When you stare into the abyss and realize god isn't real, there's no freewill , conscious agents are finite and death is coming and that's it for this conscious element in the trillions of a soup of them. I remember reading that there's a state called the ""flow"". You are enthralled in an activity. Your mind doesn't use what Daniel  K. called system 2.  System 2 is effortfull. Maintaining effortlessness is priority. Recently I've been wondering what non existence would be like and if ever my conscious would be recreated by natural processes in maybe 10 to the power of a 1000 years. Or is that just it for infinity. Do I want to exist again? I'm not sure. It's a tough question. I guess in the future things will be much better. But, existence itself is tiring. Any advice?",0

      we have not lost any of our animalistic tendencies either— to lack any sexual feelings is considered an abnormality, when in reality being able to see human beings without the filter of carnal desire SHOULD be the norm. of course that would be trim regards to the continuation of us as a species, but that simple bit of programming responsible for creating new human beings, compels many of us to upend their entire lives for those that we feel passionate toward. It is both beautiful and , if any exists, definitive proof that we are no more than little dressed up monkeys being whipped around by emotions that we are not really in touch with.. of course , some may argue that the concept of self awareness is one that only humans can consider themselves in possession of, but th what if even that is proven not to be true? what of that one dog, who was able to stare at itself in the mirror, was acknowledging its existence? how would we know?

Especially considering the realization of the severe differences noticed with ""high IQ"", ""Critical thinking"" and well the observation that it's really a mass minority of the population with amoral rational views/thoughts. 

humans with ""talented"" cognition often holistically are at an advantage. Their perceptions and views might literally be incomprehensible for someone with a more limited cognitive capacity. 

*Of course doomer/nihilistic views fundamentally don't require high IQ (the absurd amount of delusive ignorance, ego and sheltered bias and just generally how unjustified/meaningless suffering is), but the profound disconnection and implications may never occur to them due to their cognition.*

Basically those who can comprehend said nihilistic and/or controversial views/""truths"" that make humanity, legal systems and psychological/intellectual norms look like a sick joke. Or just seem unreliable. Or disconnected..people who actually philosophize like this make up a very low percentage of the population.

Seeing conflicting views and beliefs about what reality/the world is and what it should be can invoke a sense of disconnection from the sheeple/irrationally emotional and/or deluded people that are almost always more likely to become popular and have a stronger influence on more people.

Not just disconnection but possible paranoia and skepticism of your own knowledge and notions. Wondering if you actually understand the meaning and implications of the woke black pilled views. Wondering if your comprehension and notions, reactions AND perception is unreliable and ignorant. 

Feeling as if you're getting influenced too easily due to your inability to disconnect or recognize fallacies. Even in the context of ""woke"" people. **You don't know what's ""woke"".**

Identifying with biased logic due to mental health issues you don't even have. Doubting your reactions and lack of constant passive nihilism just because of how disillusioned and suicidal others seem to be...

It's easy to just, lose yourself in the constant dissatisfaction and existential disturbance with your very cognition, decisions, perceptions, reactions and philosophical/nihilistic intelligence. The inability to argue against the viewpoints, the ignorant propaganda and people you're forced to empathize with instead....being devoid of free will, doubting your own enjoyment's value and meaning.........

You can drive yourself insane with the profound disturbance of being a neurological machine and the surplus of disillusionment related to this (not just philosophically/nihilistically but just the mass amount of people who are going insane or suicidal due to this and the ignorance that comes with ignoring them all)

Suicide is so tempting, yet whether it's an actual philosophical solution or not...it's hard to tell who to trust, and whether your own philosophical justifications on the passively nihilistic, controversial, disconnective decision of suicide is actually practical or sensible.

I mean, it's just one step. Life was an accident anyway, people act like perception is everything and you should ""make the most of it"" when it was never ""meant to be"" to begin with. How the fuck are they so damn confident and entranced in this disturbing illusory existence is something I'm sick of immersing into.

This is a sub for nihilism and philosophy, although I comprehend your confusion if you haven't seen much about philosophy but only weird and unrelated posts. Nevertheless, skim through it or go directly to the analogy if you want, or if you already are savvy with certain points.

&#x200B;

**The Discourse and the Problem**

In the discourse regarding nihilism, we often come across existentialism and absurdism. To some, it is quite confusing since they happen to be similar and this similarity will lead the neophytes to confuse one for the other. But similar is all they are, they're not the same and the conclusions, you'll soon notice, are quite different.

When discussing the differences, I want you to keep in mind, that these 3 currents of thought deal with one thing that many other ideologies deal with: a Problem.

For example:

* Socialism and Capitalism
* Christianity and Sin
* Buddhism and Desire
* Stoicism and Suffering

Ideologies in general identify a ""problem"" they tend to focus on, although it may not be one problem alone, there's the presence of something that takes the focus of a certain philosophy that will become a defining characteristic of the ideology itself.

How does this connect back to our favourite 3?

Easy: nihilism, existentialism and absurdism deal with Meaning.

But the thing with the ""problem"", is that it's not just the word itself. The language changes depending on what we're talking about. If you play video games you'll know how there are certain words that will only be used within your own community that others won't be able to decipher. If you played MOBAs, then ganking, mid, ss or carry will carry a different content from what the word originally meant for an outsider.  
Thus, the same is applied when talking about Capitalism, Desire... Meaning.

These words serve to describe succintly what would take an essay (perhaps), to describe accurately to the average person who doesn't have any understanding of what X community is talking about, the actual content of the word.  
So when nihilists, existentialists and absurdists address the matter of Meaning... what do they mean?

This is a problem because, as stated earlier, it's a complicated matter but at least I can offer one facet: meaning also refers to the more base and commonplace ""meaning of life"".  
It does not stop there, it goes on to touch morality, value, existence, and so on. But the way it does it, is through a system of being unable to talk about one without talking about the other, in many occasions. But even then, the *discourse* itself is also directed on whether nihilism can be divided into various segments or whether it's a package deal where you can't only accept one aspect, but will have to accept the others.

To clear mentions of bias and my own position, I am more for the latter. I do think that accepting only one aspect doesn't make much sense, but then again, this isn't the purpose of the post, it's a discussion for another time.

So with this in mind, let me illustrate with a simple story, the different aspects of the Small 3 (since we're so few regardless of who we are) and we can finally get down to the core of the *problem*.

&#x200B;

**The Fox and the Grapes**

The fable has different versions available. Here's one excerpt from Wikipedia:

>Driven by hunger, a fox tried to reach some grapes hanging high on the vine but was unable to, although he leaped with all his strength. As he went away, the fox remarked 'Oh, you aren't even ripe yet! I don't need any sour grapes.' People who speak disparagingly of things that they cannot attain would do well to apply this story to themselves.

While the actual message of the story is not what we're analysing currently, it is however a critique, in a way, towards absurdism. You'll understand why in the next scenarios.

I wanted to use this little fable because I felt like it was a good way to portray the relationship between these 3 viewpoints and ""meaning"".

&#x200B;

***The World of the Nihilistic Fox***

The Fox wanders the world.  
One day, he comes across some grapes, hanging from vines too high to reach, or so it seems.  
However the Fox has a few choices to make:  
Should he try and get the grapes?  
Should he move on and find something else?  
Should he even consider them to begin with?  
The Fox, free to make his own choices, knows there's nothing stopping him or guiding him towards one way or another other than himself.  
The world is clear, colourful and there's no one thing that is more colourful than the rest.  
The world just is.  
The Fox may try to play around a little and see if the exercise itself could be fun, uncaring of the actual grapes.  
The grapes are but one of the many other things the Fox can find.  
The Fox walks, towards a choice of his own. The world is his oyster, in struggle and comfort, perhaps today it's grapes, or they may be carrion.  
Only the Fox will know.

&#x200B;

***The Journey of the Existentialist Fox***

The Fox is on a journey to find something.  
Unable to assuage a certain kind of feeling, the Fox stumbles upon some grapes, hanging high above him.  
They look tasty and inviting, but it seems a difficult enterprise.  
The Fox is quite hungry, but he reckons he has the strength to endure the trials necessary to get his paws on the delicious grapes.  
And so he endures, as he always did, in a world that he felt was always slightly off, the grapes make him feel alright.  
But is it the grapes or the effort itself?  
It matters not, for the Fox has found his grapes, and he will endure for as long as he needs to, to obtain that which he wants.  
In minutes or in decades, one day, the Fox believes, the grapes will be his.  
It is what he likes, so why not?

&#x200B;

***The Bane of the Absurdist Fox***

Escaping from something, the Fox sprints, panting wearily into the darkness.  
In the Fox's travails, he finally realises that there is something different before him.  
The only light and colour in the perpetually dim world that he lives in.  
The Fox, hungry, desperate and wary, slowly approaches what he recognises to be grapes.  
Without much thinking, the Fox pounces and flails, with every jump filling the Fox with hope.  
Time passes, but the only light in the world is as far as it was before its discovery.  
Days, months, years. The Grapes are nothing more than a dream, the Fox says.  
An illusion, perhaps?  
But the Fox knows, that the Grapes reign over the vineyard. Nay, the world.  
A cruel joke, the Fox thinks. The work of a madman? The spite of the world?  
A broken laugh. A blurry world. A distance growing.  
But what can a Fox do, then?  
When ignorance becomes bliss before the damnation of knowledge, there is but one thing left to do, the Fox surmises.  
To pretend.  
And so the Fox delves back into the dim world. The Grapes eternally glowing. Lingering in the Fox's thoughts. As devourer becomes the devoured.  
Back in a denied world, to laugh and to belittle...  
is to survive.

&#x200B;

**The Final Thoughts**

It should be obvious what the ""grapes"" represent in our little stories.  
They represent the ""meaning"", or rather it does in two.

Through an existentialist and absurdist view, the ""grapes"" present themselves as a problem to be resolved. The meaning that people want to have in their lives and they search for, exemplified in two situations where the grapes have a different weight.

But what about the nihilist's perspective?  
Well, that is the peculiarity of nihilism. The grapes aren't a ""problem"", they're just meant to be grapes.  
While the other two yearn for the grapes, the nihilist does not elevate the grapes as something to be above himself or above other things. It's not an absolute that defines the nihilist nor one that the nihilist defines. Because in nihilism it's not a problem to resolve, it's the mere state of being of the world: it's accepted.

However, because the rejection itself of the existence of such a ""meaning"", that in nihilism is **passive**, is still touching upon the question posed by the ""problem"" that the other two see. Hence nihilism still deals in the same field as the other two, it simply passively states that there is no problem.

The nihilistic Fox would live the day like any other.

The existentialist Fox would see the grapes as the meaning they created.

The absurdist Fox will know that the meaning is there, but cannot ever be reached, thus leading them to live a life in spite of that which is unreachable.

Coming back to the original tale, it is in effect a critique towards the absurdist who would rather live in spite than to acknowledge what they know is there. Some absurdists believe they're closer to existentialists, which is why it's more ""controversial"", but one of the differences that absurdism presents is a belief that meaning does exist, but simply cannot be reached, it cannot be found.  
Which ultimately leads the absurdist to live with the ""problem"" in a way they know is not really the ""truth"".

These are the main differences.  
Again, ""meaning"" itself means more than just the meaning of life, but by using the grapes you should be able to understand the kind of pull this ""meaning"" has.  
As a nihilist, there's no such thing as meaning, there are just things that exist and just are.

One last consideration, is that the grapes could very well have a more religious connotation, and if you noticed that, it's good that you did because the behaviours from both the existentialist and absurdist are the remnants of religious behaviour.  
It's why for them it's a problem. They wanted ""meaning"", they wanted that something that a religion could offer, and that kind of reverence towards the grapes is something they end up performing.It just so happens that, depending on the situation, to both existentialists and absurdists, the meaning offered by the existing religions is not something that they like or want to accept.  
As such, they still end up clinging to vestiges the nihilist will criticise them for holding onto.

That's why nihilism itself, that shuns this reverence, ignores it and lives without it, is the antithesis of religiosity, and why nihilism is ultimately the opposite of religion. Some people erroneously form this false dichotomy between science and religion, but since nihilism is demonised by the current status quo, nihilism isn't even considered and is shunned in turn. However, it is the closest thing to an opposite religion has.

So there you have it, the tale of the 3 Foxes.",0

1691749706.0,Sad nihilist have the same right to be here as everyone else,"ive been on this sub for two days and it seems like this discussion is an ongoing topic in here, but i think were going in the wrong direction.

philosophy has a lot to do with mental wellbeing and surely its wrong to tell people who are depressed that they cannot or shouldnt talk about philosophy. for some their depression might actually stem from philosophical conflicts and the discussion would be way more fruitful than going to some behavioral therapy.

therapy is often based on the assumption that there are pathological or dysfunctional thought patterns, and usually everything that goes against mainstream is put into that basket. it wants to surpress and irradicate them. philosophy aims to find the (or your) truth by challenging conventional thoughts. many internal conflicts need philosophy to solve and overcome them and therapy is useless or destructive.

but i think what people mainly bothers is not that there are depressed nihilists, but that their nihilism is defined by their depression. their philosophical judgment is clouded by their depression, thus their nihilism has no real substance and their posts are of no value. but i think you miss a thing

there is the philosophical side which is based on arguments and maybe some assumptions or axioms. then there is the side of experience, which is different for everyone. and they both are part of the game.

for the first mostly as much as we can say is ""nothing has objective meaning"", and we all agree and basically were done here. if someone thinks this is good or bad is entirely subjective. it doesnt change wether your a nihilist or not. if you think nothing has objective meaning your a nihilist, period. being depressed does not make you not a nihilist. the person does probably not claim to be a nihilist because hes depressed, but because he thinks nihilism is logical. maybe there is deeper and shallow nihilisim depending on how much substance there is too it. but there is no ""true"" or ""wrong"" nihilism.

now when you say those depressed nihilists dont have substance, why isnt that the case with the happy ones, arent they too just high from serotonin and thus make irrational judgements? its just there are less people posting ""i just fucked three times in a row and now im smoking a cigarette, im so happy nothing matters life is good"". but were all like that, we all have clouded judgment to a degree. then on the other hand, for the sad op it might be of value to post because he can vent a bit and for some other because he can identify with it. these posts have their audience

the real reason is people dont like seeing sadness, it disturbs them. and i understand that, but i still think sad nihilists are part of it and have a right to exist in this sub. they should maybe just try to make better posts.

I see existentialism as a glass half full. It's about personal wishes. It's about the destination.

I see absurdism as laughing at the perception that there is a difference. Facts or wishes, universal or personal, it doesn't matter, and yet it matters to everyone. They are totally different, and yet exactly the same. It's about the journey despite how ludicrous continuing is.",0

Oh? Says who?

Where does it say to be positive about it?

Last time I checked, I thought it's perceived differently by each individual considering the fact that we all have lived different lives.

1595375460.0,"Many ""Nihilists"" seem to deeply misunderstand nihilism as being inherently pessimistic or fatalistic. In a way that deeply misrepresents the concept.","If you'd rather watch this post than read it, that's an option now.  


[(mis)Understanding Nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9XKFdkxvp0&t=1s)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So.

Many here seem to hold the perspective that nihilism is best summed as

""Nothing means anything""

leading them right to;

""therefore why value subjective meaning when there's no objective meaning""

This line of reasoning seems to me to miss the point entirely.

\-

Have you ever enjoyed an experience or interaction with a pet?    
Or appreciated a moment with someone?  Or really enjoyed a good meal or sight or sound?   
 Have you ever lost someone?  hurt yourself?   felt Real hunger?     
been angry, or sad, or proud, or glad, or any of it?

&#x200B;

How about these symbols?

&#x200B;

within your mind, do they form into something coherent?

something meaningful?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Are these not all, at base, forms of creation of ""meaning""?

&#x200B;

\-

&#x200B;

It is only within the context of Minds that the concept of ""meaning"" has its foundations.

&#x200B;

And it only ever has been.

&#x200B;

I mean yeah, duh, the universe is, was, and will remain to be indifferent to these concepts that to us are central.  
\-morality, beauty, value-

&#x200B;

But to Us,

to Minds,

They Are Central.

&#x200B;

There's this viral fatalistic pessimistic nihilism i see here that's fixated on the fact that meaning doesnt matter to the universe - and never did - but that's not the context in which the word ""meaning"" has a definition..

To fixate and get lost in this unfortunate reality   
\- that meaning is only of us -  
 is to lose sight of the core of it all:

&#x200B;

The Mind itself.

&#x200B;

Just because the universe is indifferent, doesnt mean we should - or even can - be.

The ""Nothing matters lol"" crowd seem less interested in Thinking on these things than they are in getting off on spreading what - as they see it - is a truly depressing thing...

&#x200B;

.

&#x200B;

.

&#x200B;

Nihilism is just the realization that things like ""meaning"" have - and only ever have had - relevance in the context of minds.

&#x200B;

It's not that meaning itself doesnt exist...",0

i take this philosophy very seriously and i am not depressed. Existential nihilism suggests that humans have no real meaning, and that is the case, to leave an impact? you’ve got to be joking. can you remember your great great great great grandfathers name? i cant and you would have thought that would have been quite an important thing about him, but no as we only seem to remember a few generations, conclusion, none of us have meaning.

'god' has from a lot of sources unlimited power and has 'plans for everyone. Which also makes him responsible for everything that happens on this planet. Beautiful things, love and friendship. But because of how our brains work, we filter a lot of the bad stuff out because it badly affects our mentality. Including thousands of people today that have been murdered, raped and millions of depressed people on the brink of suicide. Humans are such limited creatures and don't bring the 'you need bad to know what's good' ying yang card here because it just doesn't compensate.

1662949177.0,I’m leaving this subreddit. I’m no longer a doomer.,"I’ve filled my head with nihilist philosophy for over 5 years now. I’ve finally reached a point where I’ve accepted both life and death. I appreciate the lightheartedness that can come from this subreddit, but I see far too many posts like:

“There’s no point in being happy/having morals/doing anything if we just die meaninglessly anyways”

“WhY DoNT I jUsT KiLL EvErYoNE?”

The only thing that’s real and feasible is the emotions we feel and experiences we learn from. Might as well take as much out of consciousness as we can.

Concerts, meaningless or not, are fun.
Meditation, meaningless or not, is serene.
Relationships, meaningless or not, can be powerful.
Exercise, meaningless or not, builds strength.

Reality, meaningless or not, is felt.

I’ve moved on from sitting depressed and repressed by the endless void that is reality. I’ve been cornered by the fear of meaninglessness for far too long.
I will pursue the path of knowledge, self development, and happiness, despite my powerlessness and futility.

1690141417.0,Nihilism is a gap between social programming and reality. It's not the reality. Writing this for depressive pessimistic nihilists that seem to be abundant here.,"I'm kinda fed up with all these cheesy reddit leftist ""MUH INDOCTRINATION"" cliche, so I'll just call it programming, because indoctrination implies it's ""bad"" and what subreddit is it? Right, and programming is relatively neutral, after all, not all social programming is ""bad"" or ""wrong"", despite what angsty teenagers with ego mania want to hear on reddit. So let's say you are born into a religion  teaching you, that you were born on this earth for the reason of serving God and returning to heaven. Then you come to a conclusion that it's false (I'm not personally arguing whether religions is true or false, it's irrelevant). So ""born on earth to serve God"" thingy false apart. What's left? Nothing. 

So many folks on this sub seem to mistake the first step for the destination. And they convince themselves ""there's no purpose"" just because they are convinced there's no powerful dude giving them purpose. That's because they didn't actually undo their programming, they think there ought to be a morally correct and scientifically correct reason to do things. So if there's not one, they renounce morality and go into a ~~porn binge~~ deep depression. That's total bullshit. You aren't in any way more ""right"" if you believe in this miserable worldview. There's nothing ""superior"" about being depressed. It's not a big revelation that you can technically do whatever you want. It's not a big revelation people can technically break any moral code.

 The thing is, when you open your eyes and touch grass, you see the real world around you. And it prima facie has meaning. You want to do this, you need to do that. Regardless of your ""non-belief"" in morality, you will still feel awful if you see a dude murdering another dude. Unless you are mentally unwell of course. Because morality isn't based on reason, meaning isn't based on reason. They are functions of the body (in materialism that you love to worship on this sub as ""The Science"", which is weird cuz why would nihilists bow down to status quo worldview or even care about ""truth"", whatever that may mean, I'm def not here to argue against materialism, I'm even making this argument from a more or less materialistic position). So you can believe in morality. Or not believe in it. But you will feel compassion and remorse and what not. Unless you are mentally fucked. Which is also fine. You can believe or not believe in sex being ""right"". Just like those Christians you despise. But you will generally get hard at sexy stuff. Unless you are against mentally/physically fucked. That's because reason is nothing. Yall seem to have a point on this sub that ""you are too rational to permit yourself to be happy"". Bullshit. If reason hinders your ability to function properly, guess what's the sickness here? Reason has no value in nihilism. Nihilism has no value. Stop worshiping it. It's self-refuting really. It's just social programming. It's pretty hilarious because pop nihilist ""Hail Science!"" rationalist skeptic absurdist existentialist depressed average redditor is way easier to control, he's absolute suppressed and restricted by his own dogshit philosophy. While those ""irrational dumb people"" are having fun out there. While you bitch about lack of meaning or some science blabbery or capitalism being bad cuz they don't give you stuff for free or any other reddit thing that doesn't matter. Wake the fuck up.",0

Nihilism is a mis-conception. A mis-concieved idea.
A shelter to hide behind when you give up the search for meaning to your being.

Nihilism, oh beautiful nihilism.
Yet another 'ism' people can label themselves with.

Yet another artificially created discourse to legitimize the current dogmas of the establishment.
Many of those, who label themselves 'nihilists', have never read a single discourse from Nietzsche or other nihilists. These people are the sheep.

Then you have the wolves.
These amoral individuals who have a super inflated ego, and cannot clearly identify self and other, or human emotions for that matter. They need to justify their amoral fantasies and life-goals.
As most 'nihilists', they probably read an ambridged version of 'On the Genealogy of Morals' coupled with a few pre-digested articles.

If we must put a label on Nietzsche, which would probably make him spin in his grave, it would be 'neo-pagan' rather than 'nihilist'.
Where was all the meaninglessness in 'Thus Spoke Zaratrusthra'?

The modern 'nihilists' are nothing more than a pseudo-intellectual emo, reminiscent of a confused teenager, who cannot seem to make sense of the world, and out of frustration, clinges to an explanation that is simpler and fitting to his personal biases.

Denying any meaning to life is at once illogical and absurd. Everything according to our understanding of the  world suggests otherwise.
Platon, Spinoza, Pythagoras, Newton, Copernicus, Nietzsche, Planck, Hitler, Jung, DaVinci, Darwin, they all held a profound and unshakable conviction that there is a meaning to life. An order in the chaos. A divine plan.

You have the wisdom of the Sumer, Vedic, Egyptian, Mayan civilizations all having an intricate science of spirituality, depicting a cosmos rich in meaning. Their view of the world is strikingly similar, so much so that they all talk about the same things in different manners.

It is only because of the Darwinian-Marxist influence of the 20th century, that the minds of academia and our society are poisoned with such concepts as linear evolution, mechanical organism and atheism. 

Naturally, both were Freemasons. The acolytes of a false prophet.

Why so many atheist despise christianity but continue following part of his morality.

Equality, goodness, peace.. All of those are christianity values. Before christianity people valued things like strenght, conquer and nobility. Just see how roman empire works before and after christianity.

For me, these atheist are so pathetic.

I have see this in this subreddit too, but idk if people here really ""follow"" what Nietzsche said or just want learn about this.

Btw, if you want ""follow"", you cant judge the people with moral values. Remember what Nietzsche said about criminals:

"" The criminal and what is akin to him.—The criminal type is the type of the strong human being under unfavorable conditions, a strong human being who has been made sick. He lacks the wilderness, a certain freer and more dangerous nature and form of existence, in which everything that is a weapon and a defense in the instincts of the strong has a right to be. His virtues are banned by society; the most lively drives he was born with have been entangled right away with depressing emotions, with suspicion, fear, dishonor. But this is virtually the recipe for physiological degeneration. Anyone who has to do in secret what he can do best, what he would most like to do—with drawn-out suspense, caution, slyness—becomes anemic. And since he always reaps only danger, persecution, and disaster from his instincts, even his feelings turn against these instincts—he feels they are fatal. It is society, our tame, mediocre, castrated society, in which a natural human being, who comes from the mountains or from seafaring adventures, necessarily degenerates into a criminal. Or almost necessarily: for there are cases where such a person proves to be stronger than the society—the Corsican Napoleon is the most famous case",0
1549938198.0,Do you believe mental illness actually exists?,"Depression, bipolar disorder, mood swings, anxiety, addiction etc

Are all just natural human reactions to life.

To think otherwise is to say ‘the default emotion for life is happiness.’ Which is completely ridiculous. 

Society has determined; if you’re not enjoying this world and don’t ignore all the suffering going on in the world, then you have a mental illness and aren’t normal. 

There is no proof that ‘mental illnesses’ are brain diseases and absolutely no physical ailments can be seen from it.

‘Mental illness’ is a made up disease to describe people who display anti social behavior and thoughts. 

Just because you’re not like ‘them’ doesn’t mean you have a brain defect.

‘Low serotonin’ is just a theory and not one person in existence has proven to have low serotonin and mental illness because of it.

No experiment has ever shown that anyone has an ‘imbalance’ of any neurotransmitters or any other brain chemicals. The entire theory was hypothetical brought upon by pharmacy company’s in America who make over 8.5 billion dollars a year from people who believe the myths. Over the last ten years, independent research has continually shown the chemical imbalance theory to be false. Furthermore, independent research has shown medications used to ‘correct’ the imbalance were largely ineffective with many fairing no better than placebo.

Pharmacy company’s literally spend billions marketing this false information to doctors and the public. All research done that is in favor of the chemical imbalance theory has come from inside the pharmacy companies. All research done independently have proved different.

I'm really disappointed about the ratio of absurdists and practicing nihilists here. All most of you do is realize that ""life has no objective meaning, but hey, that doesn't stop me from enjoying, I create my own meaning, etc. "" And what does this mean in practice? That you're just like everyone else. You wake up, go to work, go home, repeat, do something else on weekends, maybe even have kids (what the actual fuck?). It means that leaving the house, you act just like christians, jews, muslims, budists, spiritualists. Most atheists act just the same. Just as a christian's views on life don't contribute to their daily lives, because they still chase money, cheat, lie, fuck, use the inventions of science, etc, your views don't contribute to your lives either, because you still play the game of society. 

This is not what I would expect from users of a nihilist sub. If all nihilism is, is the acknowledgement of the lack of obejctive meaning, what's the use of it? Nothing. It's no more than a topic of discussion on reddit or on philosophy class. Why stop here? Why contribute to society? Why struggle? Why play the fuckin rotten' human game? Why be so fuckin' busy? I was in the USA once (I'm from Middle-Europe) and I saw how crazily busy people are. The people I met (and hopefully will meet again) are nice, so much more than the people here, but sooo busy that I was mentally drained after 10 days in Chicago. These guys wake up and do something EVERY DAY. Not just the work. Even on weekends. They don't know how to chill. Even who lost a daughter who was just 33. Didn't quit. Didn't turn to apathy. Grieved, but went on. Busy and stoic like everyone else. And it's a tiny bit better where I live but most people here too are still busy, busy, busy. And most people in the sub seem the same. Just like everyone else. Think as a nihilist but live like everyone else. Is there any, any difference at all between nihilism and absurdism? 

You guys make me feel like a minority even among nihilists. Because I ACTUALLY don't care. I have lost all my family. Even lost some pets. One is still alive and I can still barely see him. MY own life truly, objectively sucks. I have nothing to live for but I'm coward to die so I live for joy. Get high 4-5 days a week, wake up late, watch movies, play Magic, go outside when it's warm. I don't work. I don't want to grow as a person. I don't want to struggle. I don't want to change. I want to settle. I don't want to be an absurdist. What good is nihilism for if it changes NOTHING about your lives? Why most of you do it? Why do most of you play the social game? 

Why are you guys just like everyone else? Why aren't you exceptions? Why aren't you outsiders? Seriously, is there anyone else like me out there? Because in my life I don't find anyone, and even on this sub I'm outnumbered by people who are just like the 99%. 

I'm sorry if I come across as angry and edgy. I'm actually an intelligent, 31 yo. person. I just can't take it any more. I just wish everything would stop and people would just chill. When covid came I had hopes that society would crumble and a different age might come. But no, everything is still the same. Some died, some stayed at home, but everything is just the same and even this shit didn't stop the progress of the human race. I wish that at least you guys weren't like everyone else out there....

Nihilism is not an ideology that should be actively embraced. Disagree? I'll debate you on that subject all day long.

Everyone relates nihilism to the individual level, I think Nietzsche would actually shred all of those notions to pieces. ""What's with all the I's and me's?"" If it's truly your individualism that you hold so dear to in this nihilistic world, what exactly is it that makes you an individual? 

 ""The holiest and the mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed, has bled to death under our knife – who will wipe the blood from us? With what water could we cleanse ourselves? What lustrums, what sacred games shall we have to devise? Is not the magnitude of this deed too great for us? Shall we not ourselves have to become Gods, merely to seem worthy of it?

i might be considered the ""master of wisdom"" by normal people, or one of the most logical men, but i don't really think it's about wisdom or logic, i think it's about ""awareness"". 

for example, i believe that if a man decides to start a family in a shithole country like iran or Ethiopia, then he has no fucking rights to complain about economy, because if he really believed that economy was awful then he wouldn't have given birth to 6 fucking children in the first place. 

i sometimes come off as ""cold"", i don't give a shit about people who go to africa or pakistan only to get raped or killed by the natives. 

i don't give a shit about the man who tries to play a PRANK in public but then shit gets escalated quickly and then he gets killed. 

i don't care if someone goes to a bar and gets drunk only to be ""date raped"" by someone else. 

i don't care if someone gives birth to her children in africa only to have them dead by the next 5 years thanks to malaria or HIV or some other shit. 

seriously, i don't understand why people WORSHIP celebrities, or try to sacrifice themselves for a nation that doesn't give a shit about them. 

i don't give a shit about north korean people starving to death, they chose this and they had it coming. 

i don't give a fuck if a Swedish radical feminsit gets stabbed to death by ""mohammed"" the Syrian refugee. i never wanted refugees in my country, so those who invited them, can enjoy the shitshow alone. 

i don't understand why the fuck people LOVE TO HAVE A SUPREME LEADER. 
like fascist countries or commies. 
what's wrong with them? 

i don't understand why people want to breed to the maximum when they themselves are in poverty. 

i don't understand why the fuck people care about abortion to the point that they consider it ""murder""? 
isn't bombing Baghdad considered ""murder""? it's murder only if it's an unborn child? 
i believe the aborted children are the most lucky bastards among dead people, they never suffered through existence. 

i sometimes think that fucking normal people are just some automated bots and this shitshow is just a form of matrix. 

think about it, why the fuck are people too stupid? why? why do they always get played by psychopathic politicians? 

i don't give a fuck if a woman wanted the badboy and now is a single mom without a home, i don't give a shit about the child either, not my genes, not my concern. 

i hate pathetic people, those who survive by only having other people pity them, those dependent motherfuckers who can't get their head straight. 

i can't understand why people would want to have ""sons"" in countries with compulsory military service? and then when their sons get killed during the service, they whine and cry like babies.
you chose to have a son in a country with compulsory military service, now here is the fruit, there you go.

1671551057.0,Research on Nihilism as symptom of mental illness.,"From a psychology lens, the rationalizations we make about the world are mere symptoms of deeper things. Thus philosophy is merely a reflection of our deeper mental state.

Having studied through this lens for years, I have determined that nihilism is very, very highly correlated to specific mental illness, and I'm currently working on research too determine if nihilism is *caused* by underlying mental illness. Feelings of meaninglessness are not universal, and are actually signs of very specific mental health problems.

This research actually came about after I noticed that Zen and Nihilisim both had similar observations about the world, yet Zen correlates too extremely healthy individuals, and nihilism correlates too very unhealthy individuals. This shifted my view of philosophy from idle abstractions, to cultural artifacts.

It's fascinating, yet unsurprising, that depressed people would cling to the rationalization of depression, rather than systems that help depression. Choosing to lean into their illnesses rather than out of.

But to me the former (the nihilist atheists) are much more intellectually consistent than the latter. The latter two groups often times still speak in terms of ""fundamental, universal human rights.""

Conservative libertarians, for example, believe that we are born with an absolute right to personal freedom. Property and gun rights are also many times defended as ""inalienable"" rights.

And many of the leftist atheists will also use this terminology of absolute, fundamental human rights, but in the context of bodily autonomy (as with issues of abortion and circumcision).

To me, nihilism is the most intellectually consistent philosophy and doesn't get enough recognition for that. Nihilists understand that rights are relative, conditional, socially constructed, and never absolute or fundamental. This is because rights represent nothing more than certain values that we have, and values are never intrinsic or absolute.",0

But it isn't a fact. The fact of our existence is our actuality. I am not going to dissuade you from exploring the realms of darkness, because I believe now after having spent considerable time in it myself, that when you can only gaze into the abyss from above it. But dwelling in the abyss, you can only look up, and see light. What can that mean? It means that Value is only an individual estimation. One mans trash is another mans treasure. You value what has meaning to you. Define what is meaningful to you. You are the only creature who has control over what it is that has meaning in your perception. The fact that you have a perspective, is valuable. Maybe you were here to put meaning into the universe. Life grows. It is organic and native to this universe. Earth might be the only planet that has creatures that are capable or even interested in unraveling the mystery of its own happening. I don't know. What the hell do I know.

**CAST OF CHARACTERS**

ANNE E. DONYA

KABUHI GIRL

RING ANNOUNCER

*A wrestling ring. Surrounding the ring are bleachers-which are empty-though guard rails separate the bleachers the ring and the bleachers. In the middle of the ring, a RING ANNOUNCER, wearing a tuxedo and carrying a microphone.*  

RING ANNOUNCER

(*staring into the camera)*

This match is scheduled for one fall! Introducing first, from Manila, Phillipines, she stands in at five feet tall and weighs in at one hundred pounds, here is ‘The Kabuhi Girl’.

*Enter KABUHI GIRL, a petite Asian woman in her late twenties, as she sprints through the curtain, down the aisle, and towards the ring. She mounts the steps and steps onto the apron. With one hand holding the middle rope, she flashes a ‘V’ sign towards an imaginary audience, along with a smile, and then climbs into the ring. She removes her light jacket and casts it aside. She wears a leotard and boots. She walks over to the turnbuckle and stretches.*

RING ANNOUNCER

And her opponent, hailing from the grey wastes, weighing in at one-hundred fifty-five pounds and standing in at five-feet ten inches tall, here is Ann E. Donya.

*Enter ANNE E. DONYA, a really tall woman in her mid-thirties, as she steps out from behind the curtain and mooches towards the ring, eyes downcast. She sports a mohawk and is dressed all in black. Kabuhi Girl stops stretching and stares at her warily.*  *The Ring Announcer walks towards the ropes, climbs out of the ring and takes his seat in the corner. Anne doesn’t change her pace, however.* 

KABUHI GIRL

(*trying to work up some confidence*)

Come on!

*Anne eventually reaches ringside and slowly mounts the steps. As she grabs onto the ropes, she glares at Kabuhi Girl, who backs away one step. She then climbs into the ring by climbing over the top rope and immediately goes to the corner, sitting down cross-legged, with her back towards the turnbuckle. Both Kabuhi Girl and the ring announcer exchange perplexed glances with each other. The bell rings.*

KABUHI GIRL

(*slowly approaching Anne*)

Uh… The match has started.

*Anne doesn’t look up. She traces her finger along the mat listlessly, as if trying to draw something with her finger. Kabuhi Girl continues to slowly approach Anne.*

KABUHI GIRL

Uh… excuse me?

*Anne still doesn’t look up. She continues to trace her finger along the mat.*

KABUHI GIRL

Hello?

*Anne ignores her.* 

KABUHI GIRL

(*raising her fists, mock boxing*)

Come on, aren’t you gonna fight me?

ANNE E. DONYA

(*whispering*)

Leave me alone.

KABUHI GIRL

What?

ANNE E. DONYA

(*mumbling*)

Lemme lone.

KABUHI GIRL

WHAT?

*Anne ignores her. Kabuhi Girl slowly approaches even further.*

KABUHI GIRL

(*waving her hand in front of Anne’s face*)

Hello? Anyone home? We have a match!

*Anne slaps Kabuhi Girl’s hand away and looks up at her, scowling.*

ANNE E. DONYA

Leave me the hell alone!

*Kabuhi Girl recoils in shock. She looks back towards the ring announcer in the far corner, who merely shrugs. Anne is unperturbed by any of this, however, and returns to staring down at the mat, moping.* 

KABUHI GIRL

Excuse me!?

*Anne continues to stare into oblivion, tracing her finger along the mat.*

KABUHI GIRL

Come on, we have a show to put on, fans to please! So-

*Kabuhi Girl purses her lip, stung by the remark.*

KABUHI GIRL

You know, if you don’t get up and wrestle right now, two things will happen: one, I will beat you up right now and perhaps get myself an easy victory. Even though you are a big woman, I can build up my strength with such a big punching bag. Or two, I can be merciful and report this to the commissioner, who will suspend you!

ANNE E. DONYA

Whatever!

KABUHI GIRL

(*confused*)

What?

ANNE E. DONYA

I said, what’s the point? 

KABUHI GIRL

I don’t understand.

ANNE E. DONYA

Of course you don’t. You’ve been brainwashed!

KABUHI GIRL

Brainwashed!?

(*beat*)

By who?

ANNE E. DONYA

By the authorities!

KABUHI GIRL

HUH?

ANNE E. DONYA

You’ve been brainwashed.

KABUHI GIRL

I don’t think this is either the time or the place to do this type of thing!

Anne ignores her. Kabuhi Girl looks towards the ring announcer who responds by throwing up his arms in frustration.

KABUHI GIRL

*(clearing throat)*

Okay, I know you want me to leave you alone, but do you want to tell me what’s wrong? Why are you doing this, especially now, of all times?

*Again, Anne ignores her.*

KABUHI GIRL

Come on, let’s talk. Please? Wrestler-to-wrestler.

(*pointing towards the ring announcer)*

Never mind him!

*Anne looks up at Kabuhi Girl, staring at her intently.*

KABUHI GIRL

Wanna talk? Just you and me?

ANNE E. DONYA

(*shrugging*)

Oh, I dunno…

KABUHI GIRL

I can ask him to leave. It’ll be private, just you and me.

ANNE E. DONYA

You sure?

KABUHI GIRL

Yes!

ANNE E. DONYA

(*shrugging*)

Doesn’t matter.

*Anne looks back down at the mat listlessly. Kabuhi Girl walks over to the ring announcer’s corner.*

KABUHI GIRL

Mr. Ring Announcer, can you please leave ringside? 

RING ANNOUNCER

(*with a perplexed look on his face*)

Why?

KABUHI GIRL

I want to have a woman-to-woman talk with her.

RING ANNOUNCER

Now? When you both have a match going on? Can’t you save that for the back? 

KABUHI GIRL

She’s feeling sad right now! If I talk to her now, I can get her back into a wrestling spirit.

RING ANNOUNCER

This is ridiculous!

KABUHI GIRL

When we’re ready, one of us can call you back to watch the match up close. Just watch the screens backstage and one of us will call you.

*The Ring Announcer stares at Kabuhi Girl, long and hard. He gets up and heads towards the aisle. As he ascends, he looks back at the ladies.* 

RING ANNOUNCER

I hope you know what you’re doing!

KABUHI GIRL

(*turns to face Anne*)

I do.

(whispering)

*I hope.*

*Ring Announcer disappears behind the curtain. It is now just Kabuhi Girl, Anne E. Donya, and scores of empty bleachers.*

KABUHI GIRL

Okay, there’s gone. Want to talk now?

*Anne just shrugs. Kabuhi Girl slowly approaches her, gripping the top rope with one hand.*

KABUHI GIRL

Uhh… you’re not gonna get up and beat me up now, are you?

ANNE E. DONYA

(*snorting*)

If I wanted to beat you up, I would’ve done it the minute I stepped foot inside this ring. 

KABUHI GIRL

(*still approaching Anne*)

True, but you didn’t. Why?

ANNE E. DONYA

Why what?

KABUHI GIRL

Why didn’t you start the match? Like you said, you could’ve thrashed me right then and there, given the size difference between us, but you didn’t! No, you just stepped into the ring, sat down at the corner there, and just plain mope. Why? What’s wrong?

*Anne just shrugs.*

*Kabuhi Girl approaches until she’s a few feet away from her. She looks at her warily.*

KABUHI GIRL

Mind if I sit down?

ANNE E. DONYA

*(shrugging*)

If you feel like it.

Kabuhi Girl steps away from the ropes and sits down on the mat, cross-legged, directly across from Anne. 

KABUHI GIRL 

Wanna talk now?

ANNE E. DONYA

About what?

KABUHI GIRL

Anything; like why you’re feeling sad, or what you’re drawing in the mat there, or…

ANNE E. DONYA

Nothing makes me happy. NOTHING!

*Silence as Anne traces her finger along the mat while Kabuhi Girl stares at her, confused.*

KABUHI GIRL

I don’t understand.

ANNE E. DONYA

Nothing on this earth makes me happy, get it? NOTHING! Nothing gives me joy, I can’t have fun in anything!

KABUHI GIRL

Hah! I have a few things I want to say to that, but first I want to address your first point-your hobbies, I mean.

KABUHI GIRL

Huh?

ANNE E. DONYA

KABUHI GIRL

ANNE E. DONYA

Such as?

KABUHI GIRL

Well, for one thing, it’s fun-as most people will say. 

ANNE E. DONYA

Pfft! Fun; an artificial, fickle concept.

KABUHI GIRL

These things also make you learn; by reading, you can learn new facts about the world, learn a profession, and imagine things people would never think possible. With travelling, it’s pretty much the same as reading, except that you see it in real life, and in some cases, cooler. There, you get to learn a bit of history and a bit of mythology. With computers, well, it gives you a chance to be creative-where you get to make programs-and websites-for people and you can even make your own website, expressing yourself on it. 

ANNE E. DONYA

And the wrestling?

KABUHI GIRL

Well, you get fame, for one thing. Imagine that; all your friends watching you on youtube or TV or wherever. Plus you get to meet new people-

ANNE E. DONYA

Yeah, like your opponents.

KABUHI GIRL

Yeah, plus the fans.

ANNE E. DONYA

Fuck the fans!

*Kabuhi Girl recoils.*

KABUHI GIRL

No need to say bad words, okay? 

ANNE E. DONYA

Don’t tell me what to do! 

*Anne stares down at the mat while Kabuhi Girl stares at her.*

ANNE E. DONYA

Anything else?

KABUHI GIRL

Yes, I like the thrills-the thrill of the fight. I get to show off my skills while battling it out with some random opponent, be they male or female. Lord knows whether or not I’ll beat them or they’ll beat me.

ANNE E. DONYA

(*looking up*)

A few things I want to say to those things. What is fun? Fun is a relative term-artificial, even. By fun, do you mean something that makes you laugh and or smile?

KABUHI GIRL

Basically, yes.

ANNE E. DONYA

Okay. So those things make you laugh and smile, but how do you feel inside? In your heart? Just because you’re having a good time on the outside, does NOT mean that you are happy-with all your smiles and whatnot-on the inside.

KABUHI GIRL

I feel happy.

ANNE E. DONYA

How do I know that you’re not just saying that? Many people will tell you that they feel happy, only later you find out that they’re not, because a few days later, they’re dead-with a rope around their neck! Either that, or with their wrists shredded.

KABUHI GIRL

You can’t tell me how I feel-or anyone else, for that matter. You’re not God, you can’t see into my heart, and I can’t see into yours. Oh, I can sense, but the senses are not always right.

ANNE E. DONYA

Tell that to the animals. Animals can sense danger a mile away, and they flee. But more often than not, they can flee one enemy and get caught by another sometime later, ending their existence.

KABUHI GIRL

I don’t mean senses like danger or sensing the goodness or badness of another person, I’m talking about sensing how another person feels. You may feel like another person is miserable, but that’s not always the case.

ANNE E. DONYA

Then why do some celebrities kill themselves after partying and such?

KABUHI GIRL

Appearances can be deceiving.

ANNE E. DONYA

So how do I know that you’re not lying to me by saying you’re really happy when you’re really miserable?

KABUHI GIRL

This is the first time that we’ve met each other face-to-face; here in this ring. You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. You really shouldn’t try to analyze someone you’ve just met for the first time.

ANNE E. DONYA

Tell that to the detectives.

KABUHI GIRL

I think you’ve been watching too many movies. Those detectives do that to catch a criminal. I’m not a detective, and I’m certainly not trying to catch a criminal, I’m here in what is supposed to be a wrestling match. The detectives are just guessing. They’re human, like us. When they finally do catch the criminal, I don’t think they’ll tell them about their take on their mindset. No, they’d leave that to the psychologists.

ANNE E. DONYA

Okay, let’s get back on track. You say you like reading and travelling because you like to learn new things. Okay, fine. What’s the purpose of learning a few new things?

KABUHI GIRL

To expand your mind; to get a good job…

ANNE E. DONYA

What if the thing you learn is something that you wish you DIDN’T learn?

KABUHI GIRL

Like what?

ANNE E. DONYA

Child abuse, for example, particularly if it results in death. Or some kind of medieval torture method, particularly if it was quite brutal. 

KABUHI GIRL

Well, then, that’s why there’s such a thing as objectivity; where you put aside your own personal opinions and emotions and look at your newfound knowledge as it is.

ANNE E. DONYA

So what? You can look at some new fact with the eyes of a robot, and the fact still remains the same.

KABUHI GIRL

Amen.

ANNE E. DONYA

Did you get what I said? It doesn’t matter how you look at your newfound knowledge, it’ll still remain the same. It’ll still be something that you wish you didn’t know about. Besides, I read once-from some wise man-that too much wisdom makes you sorrowful of heart.

KABUHI GIRL

That can be true, if you don’t know what to do with the knowledge.

ANNE E. DONYA

It doesn’t matter what you do with the knowledge either, it’ll still make you miserable. Negative things can-no, they WILL-stir up negative emotions inside you, no matter how much you sweep your emotions aside. That’s the way it is with human nature. Oh, and another thing, what makes your knowledge ‘newfound’? Nothing’s new in this world. It was known-and seen-by other people way before you even knew what it was.

KABUHI GIRL

Okay…

(*beat as she looks up thoughtfully*)

You know what? You’re right. There’s a passage in the bible that says, There’s nothing new under the sun’.

ANNE E. DONYA

See?

KABUHI GIRL

But that doesn’t mean that I cannot learn new things-from scripture or anywhere else.

ANNE E. DONYA

About learning so you can get a ‘good job’; what if you get a job that you always wanted, but it turns that it’s not anything you thought it would be. Look how many people go to college, get a degree, get their ‘dream job’, and it turns out that they hate their job. I mean, these people don’t have time for their families, their health, or anything else. Just work, work, work, for money, and even then, that’s not enough! They want more! But that job is supposed to be their dream job, why should it matter how much it pays?

KABUHI GIRL

It’s all a question of balance, Anne. People don’t know how to balance priorities. For many business people, the need to make money and more and more of it often outweighs the needs of their own family and even the poor. We need to balance everything in our lives: God, business, family, and everything else. We need to worry about things that are more important. For me, God should be first-first before everything else. After all, it is written, ‘Whatever we do, do it for the Lord, rather than for man.’ You see, when you do things for the Lord, you put everything into his hands. You don’t have to worry about anything. He’ll make it work out in the end-in his own time.

ANNE E. DONYA

There you go with that ‘God’ stuff again. ‘Don’t worry about it,’ this god says, ‘cast all your cares upon me and I will take care of everything’. Really? Sounds like those guidance counsellors in high school or even psychiatrists; you tell them your problems, they’ll either babble some nonsense and charge you some money or tell you that you’re exaggerating-and I’m talking about the psychiatrists. The guidance counselors will take months to help you, just like your god. I mean, what cop would help someone being attacked by a criminal in ‘his own time’? Would you trust such a cop? I wouldn’t, and that’s one of the MANY problems with cops.

KABUHI GIRL

You don’t have any use for God, don’t you?

ANNE E. DONYA

Damn right I don’t, and I’ll get to that point in a bit. Now, let’s talk about wrestling. Oh, we all know the reasons anyone wants to get into wrestling: the fame, the thrills, and to show off their skills.

KABUHI GIRL

Nothing wrong with that, as long as you don’t let it get to your head.

ANNE E. DONYA

Okay, so let’s say you won a championship belt, and you get the fame, the glory, the big bucks, and all the hot guys oozing after you. Big deal! You may enjoy it for awhile, but don’t bank on it. You could lose it the next week, the next day, or the next month, and then what will all that fame get you? People will start to forget about you and focus their attention on the next wrestler. Then that wrestler will get all the attention you had-whether good and bad-and it doesn’t end there either. Know why?

KABUHI GIRL

I can guess…

ANNE E. DONYA

Well, you need not do so, because I’m about to tell you. The wrestler that defeated you and took your championship title, for instance, now takes your place in the hearts and minds of the fans. But he won’t be there for long, for soon another wrestler will take his-or her-place. Yet still, it doesn’t stop. THAT wrestler’s gonna be in danger of losing his title and the attention of the fans, and then the same thing’s gonna happen to THAT other wrestler, and on and on it goes.

KABUHI GIRL

Like a never-ending cycle, huh?

ANNE E. DONYA

Yeah, and that’s why I said that fun is an artificial, fickle concept. What you call ‘fun’ is merely an illusion; an illusion that gives an imaginary point to a pointless existence. You think that it lasts forever, but it doesn’t. 

KABUHI GIRL

Not necessarily so. Sure, the moment of fun is only temporary and then it’s back to a boring, miserable life-

ANNE E. DONYA

So, you are miserable then!

KABUHI GIRL

No, I didn’t say that! I’m merely saying that I agree with that fun is a temporary thing, but don’t forget the memories. That is why we have photos, facebook recordings, and so on and so forth; so that it doesn’t fade from our consciousness forever.

ANNE E. DONYA

So, relive the moment, huh?

KABUHI GIRL

Yeah!

ANNE E. DONYA

Okay, you relive the moment, then what? Eventually, you get bored with it and when you get older, you sometimes wish you didn’t do it at all. Even if what I just said was false, the memory won’t last forever! Eventually, you-along with everyone else-will die, fade into nothingness! What will your memories mean then?

KABUHI GIRL

Two things; one, I can enjoy my memories ion the afterlife, and two, my descendants can keep my memories alive.

ANNE E. DONYA

Pfft! You think you’re gonna live long enough to have descendants? You don’t know what’s gonna happen two hours from now, let alone what’s gonna happen many years from now! Even if you do manage to get descendants, how do you know they’ll respect your memory? You know how it is with kids-ALL kids, actually. They don’t respect your memory; no, they’ll do their own things and cast aside your treasures, heirlooms and memories into the toilet. 

*(beat*)

But in a bit of karmic justice, the descendants of THOSE descendants will do the same thing to do them, and the same thing will happen to THEM as well, so like you said, a never-ending cycle. 

KABUHI GIRL

Not if you train them up in the way they should go when they’re young.

ANNE E. DONYA

Yeah, and what then? Kids have their own minds, you can’t watch them 24-7 otherwise you’d have to literally attach yourself to their bodies?

KABUHI GIRL

Were you always this negative?

ANNE E. DONYA

No, I was once like you-out for a good time, fun and games and whatnot. Then, I saw the truth.

KABUHI GIRL

And what was that? How did you come to see it?

ANNE E. DONYA

The truth is that there’s no meaning to anything; no point to anything! Anything ‘fun’ is pointless and artificial. All the routines that us human beings do-careers, learning, and whatever-are also pointless, because they just add to our misery and they don’t stave off the inevitable at all-which is, death! 

KABUHI GIRL

How’d you come to think like this?

ANNE E. DONYA

I used to be a party girl; all the coolness, all the fun times. Used to go to parties every week. Then, I’d see people die-some of my friends-from drugs!

KABUHI GIRL

Drugs? Those types of parties are raves!

ANNE E. DONYA

Yeah, I used to go to those too. Anyway, I’d see friends die, and the friends that do survive; they’re not the same. They would become more quiet, more serious. They would study hard and forget about me and all their other friends, like they don’t recognize each other.

KABUHI GIRL

Those things are not a reason to be so super-negative.

ANNE E. DONYA

And I almost died!

KABUHI GIRL

(*gasping*)

You? From what?

ANNE E. DONYA

Drugs, plus a car accident. I was in a coma for nearly two weeks, and that’s when it hit me!

KABUHI GIRL

What?

ANNE E. DONYA

Nothingness! Nothing but dark, silent, nothingness! No light at the end of the tunnel, no screaming and raging fires, nothing! Just dark oblivion. When they brought me back, they told me that I had flatlined, but they brought me back. That’s when everything changed.

KABUHI GIRL

Oh, man.

(*beat*)

I’m sorry…

ANNE E. DONYA

So, now I wanna talk to you about religion. 

KABUHI GIRL

Okay…

ANNE E. DONYA

A few minutes ago, we were talking about memories, yes?

KABUHI GIRL

Yes…

ANNE E. DONYA

And you said that you’d have your memories in the afterlife, right?

KABUHI GIRL

Yes!

ANNE E. DONYA

Well, suppose you were to spend eternity either reliving or watching those memories, how long would you stand it?

KABUHI GIRL

Oh, those memories won’t be my focus. My focus would be the Lord Jesus Christ!

ANNE E. DONYA

Even Jesus! Would you be able to spend minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month and year after year locked away with all your fun moments-for eternity? How would you not go insane? You’d have nothing but those moments forever. No break, nothing. It’ll be so mind-numbingly repetitive! Boring-and pointless! 

KABUHI GIRL

No, it won’t! I’d get to meet famous people in heaven as well and we’ll share our memories with each other as well.

ANNE E. DONYA

Big deal! Even that becomes mind-numbingly boring as well. Let’s say there are millions of people in heaven, and you meet each and every single one of them. You learn from them, and then what? There’s nothing more to learn. Still boring-and pointless!

KABUHI GIRL

But you just said this THIS life was pointless.

ANNE E. DONYA

But from what I’ve read, no matter what the religion, the afterlife is the same as this life, only that it goes on and on and on…

KABUHI GIRL

But Jesus can give your life meaning-everlasting meaning! You will never get bored with him! Look at the disciples! They all died gruesome deaths, and they’re with the Lord in heaven! Even now, they’re still happy, and they’re nowhere close to bored?

ANNE E. DONYA

How’d you know that? Did they tell you that in your dream?

KABUHI GIRL

No…

(*beat*)

But I can feel it in my heart, in my spirit.

ANNE E. DONYA

Didn’t you just say that your instincts can sometimes be wrong?

KABUHI GIRL

Some instincts, yes. But not the ones that sense danger.

ANNE E. DONYA

Well, if you cannot trust your senses here, how can you trust them in the afterlife?

KABUHI GIRL

Well-

ANNE E. DONYA

Oh, I never got to talk about religion! If there is a god, why is there so much evil in the world? Look at history: the crusades, the holocaust, Ted Bundy, torture, child abuse, and on and on it goes. If there was a god, there’d be no such things.

KABUHI GIRL

Don’t blame God for the actions of bad human beings. He gave us all free-will, you know.

ANNE E. DONYA

Yeah, so why doesn’t he stop us from doing evil? Like rewiring our hearts or something like that?

KABUHI GIRL

Then, he’d be interfering with our free will!

ANNE E. DONYA

So he’s limited?

KABUHI GIRL

No, but-

ANNE E. DONYA

But crap! You have no answers! I bet you can’t even prove a god exists! There is no god and no meaning, that’s it!

*Anne looks back down at the mat, pouting and tracing her finger along the mat.*

KABUHI GIRL

Can I ask you a question?

ANNE E. DONYA

(*shrugging*)

If you feel like it.

KABUHI GIRL

If you see so much wrong in wrestling, why are you part of it? Why are you even here?

ANNE E. DONYA

Two reasons: one, because there’s a small part of me that still seeks some enjoyment in life, a small spark that wants to have fun, but that spark dies down the minute I get to the fun part-every time. Two, maybe if I come out to the ring, sit here and mope, you would come, pity me enough to talk with me, and maybe I could educate the brainwashed sheep watching from their computers at home about how life is REALLY like. Congratulations, young girl, you’ve just helped me do that!

KABUHI GIRL

But you’re ruining it for the fans! You’re here to wrestle, not spread negative vibes! I bet you that the promoter’s watching this right now, and he’s gonna kill you. Once he’s done with you, you’ll never wrestle in this town; no, this country, ever again!

ANNE E. DONYA

(*shrugging and continuing to trace her finger along the mat*)

No big deal!

KABUHI GIRL

(*throwing her arms up*)

Aiee!

ANNE E. DONYA

Frustrated?

*Kabuhi Girl takes a deep breathe, relaxing herself.*

KABUHI GIRL

You say you don’t like doing ANYTHING, right?

ANNE E. DONYA

Right…

KABUHI GIRL

Not even drawing?

ANNE E. DONYA

That’s included in the category of ‘anything’.

KABUHI GIRL

Well, what are you doing right now?

ANNE E. DONYA

Nothing!

KABUHI GIRL

Oh, don’t give me that! You’re drawing, although it’s only an invisible line. You’ve been doing that quite a bit during our conversation. If you really didn’t enjoy drawing, you’d just be sitting there, staring at the mat, and nothing more!

ANNE E. DONYA

I’m just doing this because…

(*beat*) 

Because of habit. A habit is not something that you necessarily enjoy. You just do it because you just do it. It’s like biting your nails, you do it just to do it, and that’s why I’m drawing invisible lines; just to do it!

*Kabuhi girl sighs, gets up and backs away a few steps. Anne remains seated. Kabuhi Girl revs up for a fight.*

KABUHI GIRL

So, I suppose you’re not gonna fight me?

ANNE E. DONYA

No point, like I’ve said quite a few times before!

KABUHI GIRL

(*lifts her arms up in worship*)

Praise the Lord for my victory this day. A woman-much bigger stronger, and older than me-is not going to fight me. I’m certain to win this time!

ANNE E. DONYA

Wait! You’ve never won a wrestling match before?

KABUHI GIRL

(*shaking her head sadly*)

No. But since you’re not going to fight me, I’ll have an easy win!

ANNE E. DONYA

(*looking up*)

Oh, it’s an easy win you want?

KABUHI GIRL

(*nervous laughter*)

Well, you said you weren’t going to fight me.

ANNE E. DONYA

I’m not! Move back a bit!

KABUHI GIRL

(*perplexed*)

What?

ANNE E. DONYA

Move back a couple of steps!

KABUHI GIRL

Uh…

ANNE E. DONYA

Trust me!

*Reluctantly, Kabuhi Girl steps back a few paces. Anne scoots forward, turns around, and lies down on her back, with her head near Kabuhi Girl’s feet.*

ANNE E. DONYA

Here! Pin me!

*Kabuhi Girl just stands there, nonplussed.*

ANNE E. DONYA

Pin me! You thanked your god for an easy win, didn’t you? You never won a match, right? Well, here’s your chance for a first-time win! Just put your foot on top of my chest, count the one! Two! Three! And viola; victory’s yours! You might as well do it right now, since apparently, I couldn’t convince you of the pointlessness of life! 

KABUHI GIRL

What can I say, Heh! Heh! I’m a positive girl!

ANNE E. DONYA

Come on, then! Seize the moment and store it in your happy memories! 

KABUHI GIRL

Yeah, might as well! Even if what you’ve been telling me is true, I should at least seize the moment now and get my few seconds of fun, even if it won’t last for long! Better to just enjoy while it lasts.

ANNE E. DONYA

That’s the spirit!

*Kabuhi Girl cautiously approaches Anne and, just as cautiously, places her foot on top of Anne’s chest. She starts to count when suddenly Anne’s hands spring to life, gripping Kabuhi Girl’s ankle.*

KABUHI GIRL

Hey! What the…?

*Kabuhi Girl struggles to free her ankle, but Anne tightens her grip. She bolts up to a sitting position, tripping Kabuhi Girl up.* 

KABUHI GIRL

(*falling*)

Hey!

*Kabuhi Girl falls face first onto the mat. Anne is now on top of her, raining down fists at the back of her head. She moves down, strikes her twice in the back with her forearm, and then gets to her feet.*

ANNE E. DONYA

Hah! Stupid girl! Did you really think I was just going to lie there and let a little wimp like you get the win?

*Kabuhi Girl groans while Anne delivers a vicious stomp to her back, all while flashing a malicious smile.*

*Anne grabs Kabuhi Girl by the back of her leotard and pulls her to her feet. She then turns her around and places Kabuhi Girl’s head between her legs. Anne looks around, waiting for a cue from an imaginary audience.*

ANNE E. DONYA

(*wrapping her arms around Kabuhi Girl’s waist* and *lifting her up*)

Up we go!

*Kabuhi Girl’s resting on Anne’s shoulders. Kabuhi Girl squirms, but Anne holds on tight.*

KABUHI GIRL

No! No! NO!

*Anne leans forward and slams Kabuhi Girl face-down onto the mat as hard as she could. She wastes no time as she gets down on all fours, turns her opponent over onto her stomach, and lays down across her chest.*

ANNE E. DONYA

(slapping the mat)

One!

ANNE E. DONYA

(*slapping the mat*)

Two!

ANNE E. DONYA

(*slapping the mat*)

Three!

*The Ring announcer steps through the curtain, but he doesn’t come down the aisle. He stands just before the curtain. Anne gets to her feet, raising her arm in victory while gazing contemptuously at Kabuhi Girl.*

RING ANNOUNCER

Here is your winner, Anne E. Donya!

*The ring announcer sinks back behind the curtain but Anne doesn’t move. She doesn’t even make any further attempt to showcase her victory. Instead, she stares down at the prone body of Kabuhi Girl*

ANNE E. DONYA

Two things, little jobber: One, there’s no such thing as an easy victory and two, never be deceived by appearances. 

*She spits on the ground, near Kabuhi Girl’s head and then climbs out of the ring in the same way she climbed in, making her way towards the curtain*.

What a lot of you are referring to is nihilistic apathy and I hate to burst you bubble but in the 21st century this is an extremely common and mundane worldview. The philosophers that coined and predicted the coming wave of nihilism predicted that this is how it would present itself and made volumes of texts to salvage philosophical meaning.

Nihilism is not liberating, its debilitating.

Nihilism is not a philosophical destination, its a morbid realisation.

Let me clarify;

If you found liberation in the realisation of your own nihilism you've experienced an ironic twist of fate. In exploring your nihilism and meaninglessness you found something inside you that dares to exist regardless of nihilism. You've found the source of your meaning and can no longer call yourself a nihilist. Your subjective meaning has come forth but you give credit to nihilism and meaninglessness.

Nihilism is not a place to rest your head if you plan to wake up in the morning. There are no living absolute nihilists you must work to evolve your thought process. In the 21st century not many insist that meaning is an inheritance so why do you still feel hard done by? Put meaning in its correct location and grow out of the despicable pit that is nihilism.",0

I generally have no interest in living out the next 40 years of my life slaving myself to the corporate world in this rat race. I am a nihilist so I'm not afraid of suicide, death has been antagonized for centuries purely cause of religion. Not anymore, not by nihilists anyways.
I was thinking I would take out a loan once I get a generic office job, leave the country and enjoy my last remaining months. Rather live a good time than a long time.
But this raises a question, what if instead of killing myself, I asked my parents to pay my debt. If they refused, I suicide. If they obliged with no conditions then I live. Would your parents do it? If you are a generic, entitled child, would you go through something absolutely insane just because your parents don't spoil you?
After 2 decades of my life, I can safely say I'm not impressed. Not at all, not with my life, not with my parents. Nothing. I mean if you are gonna put me on this disgusting planet without my permission the least you can do is compensate me for my suffering. $50,000 barely covers it but beggars can't be choosers. So I was thinking I tell my parents if they dont pay my debt, im killing myself. It sounds so insane it might actually work. 
If you hate your parents and you feel trapped and feel suicidal and there is absolutely nothing that can change your mind. Try this out, it might actually work. Or at least take out a loan before you die. Good day.

Nihilism is truly powerful. You threaten to kill yourself for personal gain, and if successful, you get what you want. If unsuccessful, you die and leave this disgusting planet, find out what is on the other side and leave all your problems behind. Don't have to worry about jail or pain. Just splatter your brains on the pavement. You win either way. When you lose you still win. The power of not being afraid of death is truly amazing.",0

1530625072.0,"Will any Nihilist actually answer what ""meaning"" means?","\*\*EDIT\*\*: Four hours in and only one person has even attempted to answer. Exactly my point.

It's really frustrating in this sub, every nihilist saying nothing has ""meaning,"" or nothing ""matters,"" yet in all of the dozens of times I ask the nihilist to define those terms, all I get are dodges. Like:

* ""Meaning is like what religious people have. I don't.""

This doesn't answer the question. I asked ""what does meaning mean,"" not ""give an example of people who have meaning.""

* ""Meaning is like a point to life""

This just changes the question to ""what does 'a point to life' mean?"" Same with other synonyms like ""significance"" or ""purpose.""

* ""What is meaning? Nothing, apparently, because it doesn't exist.""

Yet again, a blatant dodge to the question.

All the same responses (i.e., dodges)  happen when I ask somebody who says ""nothing matters"" to explain what they mean by the term ""to matter.""

If your entire worldview is based on the idea that nothing matters and nothing has meaning, shouldn't you be able to actually explain what those terms mean when asked?

\*MY RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION:\* When something ""matters,"" it means something that a mind is concerned with and finds important to them; it can make them super happy or super sad, depending on the scenario. For example, a person's dog matters to them. If the dog is playful and silly, it makes the person happy. If it gets sick or dies, it makes the person sad. This person spends a lot of time with the dog and the dog's wellbeing and happiness is a primary concern to the person. This dog ""matters"" to the person. This same idea applies to the words meaning, significance, ""a point,"" purpose, etc.

To somebody who would say ""nothing matters""; When I ask YOU what ""to matter"" means, what would you say it means? ""For something to 'matter,' it would mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""  Can somebody fill in that blank?",0
1511961250.0,Disproving nihilism with erections,"we all know what an erection is. but why is it?

well, do you honestly think an erection is just a bunch of atoms strung together made to look like the most hospitable, humanitarian symbol the universe has to offer but with no intrinsic meaning?

when someone gets an erection, everyone in the room knows what's up. literally. the meaning is obvious, its self-evident. 

when you look at something arousing, you get an erection. but upon deeper investigation and retrospection, you come to realize it's not you who's doing the erection. it's the *meaning* behind the erection that gives it life, the meaning is the reason there is an erection in the first place at all!the pump you feel as your chub gets into a higher state of existence (transcends into erection realm) IS the meaning itself, you can FEEL the meaning!

I therefore conclude that with every drop of meaning, comes an erection. with an erection, great responsibility.

1477001350.0,Living Can Kill You.,"When I was reading Elie Wiesel's ""Night"" in my tenth grade English class, we came across a quote of irony that I felt rang true more than ever. It spoke of the irony of a warning sign of death by electrocution, but yet almost anything or anyone could kill you, without warning. This quote stuck with me, and more than likely fueled my feelings of mortality. This feeling, led me to nearly stab myself with a pair of scissors on a Friday night, while my Mother was yet again drunk. When I spoke with my grandmother, I told her how sick I was of life, and how I would die at any moment, and how it all meaningless it all was, life itself. The reason I bought this up, is my Mother recounted a story to the owner of our current rental house, of how she almost left the gas from the stove on. ""We all would've fallen asleep and never would've got up."" She jokingly remarked.  I looked at my little sister's face for any sign of fear, but she isn't phased. The quote repeats through my head, filled with connotations of anxiety. I sometimes forget, in my depressive ramblings, how easy it is, to be not be able to wake up again. To involuntarily leave this existence that I have come to resent. It fills me with relief, but yet it also brings with it, a sense of fear. Neither mean anything anyhow. I came to terms with my fate, a long time ago.

if our universe slams back in on itself to create a new proto universe (previously the only reason for any hope that anything will ever continue) it will probably slam down into perfect balance.

so chances are, after this universe dies, nothing will exist, ever again.

and before you say 'that is what makes us special / gives meaning' it doesn't, it is what prevents us from having a meaning.

if the universe were to reincarnate, there there would have been a slim chance that it would have borne intelligent enough life.

1460221712.0,All people are nihilists. Some of them simply don't understand what it means and choose to ignore it by following automatic behaviour.,"Every human being is born a nihilist. Nihilism, as the truth about the world, as the governing principle, shapes everything, including minds of newborn humans.   
Every culture,  religion and ideology, every scientific theory, are forms of nihilism, they can be practised and enjoyed by nihilists, as by anyone else.  
  
The key feature that distinguishes an accomplished-nihilist, from the rest of nihilists, is that she does not avert her mind from the truth, every day of her life she is capable of entertaining thoughts without necessity of sense, as she might be able to perform rituals without the necessity of God.  
  
What nihilist perceives world to be is pure form, and content being just a temporal subset of that form created by superposition.  
  
Mathematics is a perfect example of nihilistic form. it  does not require sense to function or be developed. It is a purely formal endeavour, yet it can be entertaining, useful, and a mean to organise ones life.  
  
Science is a purely nihilistic project. Theories of physics do not require any sense or closure, or meaning. They are meaningful in themselves, as emerging forms.  
  
Nihilism is not related to any specific form of behaviour and especially emotions. All emotions and behaviours are nihilistic. The distinction may by only made weather they are conscious or unconscious behaviours and emotions.  
Consciousness about ones nihilism is the basic distinction of an accomplished or primitive nihilist.  
  
Nihilism does not state world does not exist, or that it is all nothing.  
Nihilism exposes idea of nothingness as an ideological concept, not related to reality.  
Nothingness and somethingness are arbitrary tools of mind, like 0 and 1.  People live in misconception that concepts equal reality - nihilism exposes this misconception as ideology.  Reality is reality, and concepts are just a small part of it, forms inside human minds.  
  
Nihilism is the only perspective of truth.  
  
Nihilism is fun, pleasure and allows to live happy life, just as knowing mathematics allows you to live a happy life.  Any negative feelings or behaviours associated to nihilism are projections of people embedded in ideologies, automatic reasoning based on tautologies.  
Nihilism is the ultimate anti-tautology which erases all tautologies, an opening for thought, and freedom to CREATE FORM to ones liking. This liking is a basic form nihilist shapes during his life.  
  
You are allowed to feel pleasure in everything you do or think. There are no rules to pleasure. You are allowed to enjoy. No thought is capable of influencing your feelings. What influences your feelings are experiences. Thought is not an experience, it is a confrontation with memory of experience, therefore all emotions thought brings are emotions of past experiences, so those experiences are the true source of emotions, not the thought. Thought is a process of super-positioning, overlapping of memory objects, it is a relation expressed as an potential. Source of this potential is the difference of memory objects, not the thought itself.  
Logic can be painful only as long as you remain a narcissist. Ability to disconnect facts form ego is a basic skill for a nihilist to learn, source of freedom of thought.

So whenever I'm in class, there's this heavy feeling that makes me feel empty, I feel suicidal, I've always felt suicidal when I knew that there was no one who relates to me in real life, well...I thought that but then in 7th grade, I met a American friend who said that she respects lgtbq and atheist, I was really feeling hopeful like I could tell her anything then. 

8th grade came and I was talking to her today and I was talking about how much I respect gay people(she doesn't know that I'm a atheist or lgtbq so I'm just pretending not to be)and then she started saying homophobic stuff....😐she said ""gay people are weird, they don't even get bullied"" and I told her ""yes, they do and they also get killed every year"" and she said doesn't care..I don't know how can a person's mind can change this quick, last year she was a mature kid..now she's becoming like theses people, I'm sure her parents are putting her in religious classes but I didn't know people actually take them seriously..I used to be in religious classes because of my parents and I always hated it and never changed my mind.

Now, I feel hopeless, like I'll never met someone who is actually mature...I really thought she was mature, I hate being a 13 years old and having to have this kind of thought but I love it at the same, I have a old mind in my young body..I knew how fucked up the world is, I'm always serious, I can't feel emotions, I have suicidal and homicidal thoughts and I didn't care about anything, I just live because I have no choice other than go to school, sit in my ass and listen to teachers brag about their stupid pathetic lifes and I try hard to keep up with grades, family issues...I never talk to my family so we're like strangers..I hardly talk in a year, people think I'm mute..now I'm in reddit and I like to hear people's different lives, I would sometimes give them a advice or a educational stuff..I really like to read books and astronomy...biology and physics are my favorite..I wanna get a telescope one day and look at the stars all day while listening to music so I could forget about all theses nonsense and just live my life for rest of my life not caring about people's bullshit.",0

I can easily define my own moral system in which racism is a virtue.

e.g. most of you ""anti-racist"" virtue signalers probably eat meat. At least a high % of you.

because in your completelly arbitrary moral system, animals are in a different category than humans, and therefure animal suffering doesn't count.

(this is not to defend vegans, they are equally retarded, because who says it is ok to kill plants?)

So, I can just easily create a moral system which creates categories around different races of humans. It is just as arbitrary as your system.

I'm 16 and have already decided that I have no real use in this world and plan to exit it in the next 14 years. After adopting this ideology, my life, as some people had put it, has fallen apart. My girlfriend left me, and I once used to have nice long hair, be pretty muscular and a great social life. I now have no friends, dry, dirty hair with a EXTREME receding hairline and no point in existing. I don't watch TV as eventually I will be dead and not remember it, so it has no point. I don't play videogames as in 70 years I will be dead and not remember it so it has no point. I don't go outside as in 70 years I will be dead and not remember it so it has no point. I don't take care of myself because in 200 years I won't be remembered and will be nothing but grime in the ground. I don't help people or charity as in 100 years nobody will remember it and the people I help will be dead, and then even if it has an effect their children will die eventually too.

1691758777.0,"Fellow nihilists, why wouldn't you want God to exist? Why is the Abyss better than Perfection? Why is subjectivity better than objectivity? Why is meaninglessness better than grand narrative and purpose?","I understand if you simply aren't convinced enough to believe it is true but surely you would rather it be true than not? Me personally, I’m what you call a non resistant non believer. Meaning I can’t bring myself to really believe it but I wish with all my heart that Christianity is true. So I live as if Christianity is true (and actually got baptised in the Catholic Church) even though I think the teachings and promises of Jesus are simply too good to be true.

God is the only hope for man, the only possible logical defeater of the Abyss.

If God does not exist, there is no reason why you are here. You are just an accidental byproduct of nature. A result of time and chance.

Your sense of self is just an illusion created by chemicals in your brain. The mind is reducible to the brain. You are an animated bag of molecules. A hunk of spoiling flesh on disintegrating bones. There is nothing more to you than that. Even this propensity for inventing meaning and purpose is just a evolutionary mechanism for survival. But any meaning or purpose is an illusion. There is none.

On scientific naturalism, we know that the ultimate fate of the universe and everything in it is to die in the heat death of the universe.

Right now you are simply on an earlier point in a timeline that inevitably leads to oblivion. And you can’t change the outcome or break the chain of causality. You are essentially a biological puppet in a universe of impersonal and indifferent forces far beyond your understanding. After all, why should evolution even select for our minds to know truth? The blind non guided evolution of our minds is shaped toward our survival, not to knowing truth.

Man thought that in killing God, he would finally be free. But all he has done is traded in one slavery for another.

Before killing God, he was a slave to a personal creator. After he kills God, he is still a slave except to impersonal and indifferent forces that govern every aspect of his being and his existence down to the molecular and atomic level.

The question is which slavery would you prefer?

The non existence of God is not freeing, it is paralyzing. It is to be a cast away with no direction better than the other precisely because there is no ultimate End or Purpose. No path is more valid than the other, all are equally valid or equally worthless. There is no rhyme or reason to any of them except that which you invent as a delusion. All paths lead to the same inevitable, universal cul de sac known as Death.

A man's life may be important relative to certain other events but if all events are ultimately utterly meaningless, what can be the ultimate significance in influencing any of them?

Mankind ultimately is no more significant than a swarm of mosquitos, for their end is all the same. This is the horror of man. Because he ends in nothing, he ultimately is nothing. But it gets even more distressing. For if life ends in the grave, it makes no ultimate difference whether you live as Joseph Stalin or as a mother Teresa. If your destiny is ultimately unrelated to your behavior, then you may as well just live as you please. Moral values are either just expressions of personal taste, or else the byproducts of biological evolution and social conditioning. Who's to say whose values are right and whose are wrong? Now think of what that means. It means that it is impossible to condemn war, oppression, or pride as evil. To kill someone or to love someone is morally equivalent. Our predicament is that it is impossible to live consistently and happily with such a worldview.

The atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell held that moral values are simply expressions of personal tastes, and yet Russell admitted that he could not live that way. He therefore found his own worldview, and I quote, ""incredible. I do not know the solution,"" he confessed. If death stands with open arms at the end of life's trail, then what is the goal of life? Is there no reason for life? If its destiny is a cold death in the recesses of outer space, then the answer is yes; it is pointless. We need to wake up and understand the gravity of the alternatives before us. If God exists, then there is hope for man. But if God does not exist, then all we are left with is despair. Faced with an atheistic worldview, the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre realized that life is absurd. In his play ""No Exit"" he tragically portrayed the life of man as hell. The final words of the play might serve as an atheistic mantra: ""Well, let's get on with it.""

If, however, God does exist then there is a reason why I’m here. I must have some part to play in the story He has authored, no matter how small. Human beings were made to be in communion with the infinite, boundless, unsearchable and fathomless almighty God. There is also a reason for evil and suffering. There is redemption from it. The atheistic solution to suffering is just to shrug one’s shoulders and say, “that’s the way it is and there’s no greater meaning or reason for it all. It’s just bad luck, a shitty roll of the dice.” If God exists then what lies at the bottom of reality is not nothingness but sheer perfection beyond our wildest comprehension, an Eternal, Inexhaustible, and Imperishable Flame of Hope and Goodness that never goes out.",0
1669740033.0,Hate is often justified & necessary.,"First, lets define hate & love:

&#x200B;

Love: someone else is so important to you, that you would sacrifice your life for them. (or at least, you would risk your life to save them)

&#x200B;

Hate: you would destroy your own life, if you could also destroy the life of the hated person (or group).

An example would be someone doing a suicide bombing mission.

&#x200B;

So, these are 2 extremes on a dimension.

&#x200B;

Here comes my first argument:

&#x200B;

Love implies hate.

If you really love someone, by definition, you have to hate everyone, who wants to harm/kill this person.

Because you would sacrifice yourself to save the loved person, but that implies, you would sacrifice yourself to stop (and maybe kill, if there is no other option) this other person.

&#x200B;

My second argument:

Hate is often a healthy response.

&#x200B;

There are many things in this world that are bad for you. And many of those things are other people. Rapists, murderer, terrorists.

&#x200B;

It is good to hate those people. Because only when you have a very strong emotion, will you be inclined to do something to stop them.

&#x200B;

But our culture has gaslighted people into believing, that we should never hate someone. that we must always tolerate. And this is bullshit.

If someone wants to harm you and your community, it's not only not wrong to hate them. It is actually the right thing to do.

&#x200B;

If you don't hate evil people, you won't do the necessary work to stop them.",0

I see people saying 'yes morals are subjective and ultimately meaningless, but I still don't want to cause more suffering than is necessary.'
Well just imagine suddenly, at the age of 30, you get a burning desire to procreate -- you decide you actually do want to become a dad after all. What sort of moral nihilist would you be if you resisted these strong, basic urges on the basis that 'life is meaningless, life sucks, I don't want to inflict it on my kids'.

Here Goes.","Unerstand, I am operating on a limited education, the observable universe, piss poor research, and whether you wanna believe it or not, what the Universe actually tells me. You might call me an oracle, though I wouldnt even call myself that, I just keep getting all this jumbled information in my head. I can only guess it is a combination of what I already listed. I was a straight A and B student on the dean's list at Ashford University, that was a few years ago, you can check for yourself if you wish, it is a public record made available by said University. I majored in psychology, so of course I took a philosophy class, in fact, Professor Nguyen was very complimentary of my work in his class. Had some health problems and did not get to graduate, could not afford to. So next time you wanna talk shit about me not knowing what the subject is, you can shove that statement right up your ass. Shit it out, and then shove it up there again. Right? Right, now onto this fun game. I'll start with my logical inconsistencies, and then we will do yours. Okay.

I operated on some half\-assed information when I wrote that post. Okay, you are right the Universe is moving in a helixical pattern. Kudos. I stand corrected. It does make more sense that we move this way, since we are trapped in a giant gravity well, the entire solar system is. The galaxy itself is moving at an astonishing rate as well, though we are not really sure what kind of pattern it moves in. Presumably, it is moving in one of the common patterns we see here on Earth. The Universe is moving at a constant rate of expansion, this we know. We also know from certain pictures, that if you zoom all the way out and view the observable Universe from as far away as we have achieved so far, it does look very much like our own brain synapses. Does that mean the universe is a giant brain? Not necessarily, that was never really my argument. My argument remains that the Universe either is life itself, though maybe not alive per say, or is alive in the sense that it contains the blueprints of consciousness. Does the Universe have recognizable DNA and RNA, well, yeah, it must contain these somewhere, else how did life get started on Earth in the first place, not to mention the other forms of life that we have verified to exist, albeit simplistic as it is, in other parts of the Universe. If nothing cannot produce nothing, then nothing cannot produce life can it?

I created a logical inconsistency when I tried to say that the Universe gives meaning. Okay, how's this then, the only actual meaning is that we are a sensory organ for a particle that had the concept of pleasure but no senses to experience pleasure with, so using the information available to it, it created the universe and as a result of that, us, with which to experience pleasure, an endless variant of pizzas and apple pies if you will. Not to mention sex, drugs, and rock n roll. All pleasurable things. 

There never was nothing, there was always just this one particle, which contained energy, which it used to create all that we know and observe. These preceding paragraph's are the crux of my argument that all philosophy is pointless. If I missed any of my own logical inconsistencies, please, feel free to nicely point them out. I will try to correct them. 

Okay now a few of your logical inconsistencies:

Altruism is not a product of philosophy, it is a product of evolution. It is nothing more than a survival mechanism. George Price, if you did your homework you will know this, effectively proved this with his Altruism Theorem. Stop trying to argue this, it is a fact, and you are wrong. Check out this great book The Price of Altruism. That is not the full title, but it is enough, google for it, great read. 

Just because Apophenia is a thing, does not mean it is always correct. These patterns exist because of cause and effect. Hexagons are one of the strongest structures in nature, so hexagons show up everywhere. Same with Arches, domes, circles, triangles, basically those things which are strongest are those things we most commonly use. Those things that are weakest may still have their uses, though they are used less commonly. Many patterns also have mathmatical signifigance to the universe, without them we would not understand many things. Without gravity for instance, and apples, Newton would not have invented Calculus. Without Calculus, physics as we know it now would not be as advanced, and Einstein would never have questioned Newton's discoveries and came up with the Theory of Relativity.

Just because the Universe is alive, if indeed it is, does not ipso facto mean everything it contains is alive. 

It has everything to do with philosophy in general not just Nihilism. If the Universe is alive, it means we have been doing everything completely wrong, mainly in the way we disrepsect our benefactor. If the Universe is simply the source of all that is alive, it still means philosophy is wrong, becuase either way, we are still just one particle, this is quantum physics. Find the documentary, which is not opinionated nonsense, ""What the Bleep do we know?"" this is quantum physicists explaining current hypothesis in the that field of study, fascinating stuff and worth your time. What happens if it turns out that there is meaning to life, and that that meaning is to be a sensory organ, nothing more nothing less? What if as Nihilism states there is no meaning at all, does that negate that the universe is alive? No it does not, nor does it negate the Universe being the source of all meaning or life, in fact it would further suppor the idea that the only thing that gives anything meaning at all is consciousness. Ergo, there is meaning in the sense that life gives things meaning in order to define itself. That make would make Nihilism incorrect would'nt it? It would actually make most theologies and philosophies incorrect.

Earth tree's are alive, and in fact, all plants are, and they are possessed of consicousness, so are animals. What differentiates us from a tree and an animal is the degree to which we are conscious. Information for life must be contained somewhere, and it is either contained in a living conscious universe or it is contained in a stream of consciousness that exists as energy throughout the universe, and animates matter wherever it is sustainable to do so.

Okay, so without using a fine tooth comb, I addressed many of the major logical inconsistencies found through out my post. ""So you think there is no pattern and that the Universe is not alive. Science says you are wrong.""

I'm a pessimist, determinist and an antinatalist (and a vegan wannabe, and an anrachist, and so on...). I know (think) that at the end of the day, nothing matters even to me or to anything, but I still care about things that are important to me. I can't stop doing so.

I hate the fact that my preferences and actions are not decided by myself, but by those 'causes' outside my control, like, situation, environment, instincts, people around myself, and so on. I think the reason why I hate this is because I had this strong desire to be ""truly free"" from everything, so ""I"" can choose what I like or dislike, how I think, and how I see... 
I'm pretty sure that there can be no such thing, since if there's no predetermined preferences or influences, I will not prefer anything. But I still have the desire for this ""true freedom"". Needless to say, I hate the fact that I have this desire, too.

Although I only know very little about it, I see Nietzche's ubermensch concept as something silly. What's the point of making ""your own values"" when there's no point in doing so, other than to make yourself feel a little better? It seems like something for those who still want to feel ""meaningful.""

I want to die peacefully ASAP, since I see no life as worth living (no matter how ""satisfied"" or ""happy"" I am). Doing things I ""like"" feels like nothing but a torture. I've never decided to ""like"" those things I currently like.

Or... I want to become a true nihilst, so nothing can bother me. Once I become a true nihilist, I guess I wouldn't care whether I care or not about anything though.

Thank you:)



EDIT:I guess I should add a bit. All the things I listed above are just my preferences. I happen to become a person who I am. Not because choose to be. I do care about meaninglessness, but it just doesn't matter. What I'm curious about is, when I think that whatever happens only (looks like it) matters to the individual, whether I ""care"" about things or not makes me less-nihilist. I couldn't really find more, universal definition of nihilist.

Our moral sense however, evolved for one thing, to aid in group cooperation, and shared intentionality. These things don't ""truth track"" at all. The only thing you should glean from the existence of your moral intuitions (using reason) is that they are there, as rough approximations of social signaling behaviour, to help you survive.

1578673168.0,depression and nihilism is incompatible," 

First off, I don't want to talk down depressed people or ignore the issue.

I was depressed for years and I know how hard it is.

But nilhilism lead me more and more to questioning my beliefs and why I was depressed in the first place

since I have opened myself to the nihilistic reality, my depression is gone.

I now think, that depression is when you become too much biased in one direction, you see the negative in everything, and attach a lot of meaning to the negative.

""I only have a minimum wage job and it sucks"" -> you can be perfectly content as a unemployed slob

""I'm ugly"" -> so you overvalue how other people see you

""climate change is going to destroy the world"" -> you attach meaning to the continuation of the human species

I don't want to say this is easy. It's probably very hard to achieve this mindset, as it took me almost 15 years to get rid of my depression.

But I think if you apply your rational thinking and logic to the issue, you cannot be depressed after realizing that everything is truly meaningless.

You just become an observer and can be amused at everything. Or you can be sad. The point is, it doesn't matter. You can watch your own emotions truly detached.

1601756919.0,Being a virgin has turned me towards nihilism,"I’m new to this sub so I apologize if this is an inappropriate post but I thought I could use some insight. 

So these thoughts were triggered when I was in this r/askreddit thread about people’s first times. I always read them because how else am I gonna get an idea of what it’s like? It’s depressing but I do it anyway without fail. 

Anyways you see all these comments about how people realized “oh, this is what I was made for”, “sex is so amazing, this is the purpose of life”. Stuff like that. I mean not just pleasure, but an *affirmation of existence itself*. 

Of course most people aren’t virgins so most people reading don’t know the other side. I mean biologically sex is the reason for existence, obviously. We’re machines made of flesh programmed to want to fuck and have that pleasure. Great, for the people that have it. What about those that don’t? How do you live and *not* experience the pinnacle of existence? I think more people are virgins than ever before so it’s an important discussion to have. 

It’s so depressing to me. I think I’m officially an older virgin now at 26. Almost 27 in half a year which will happen in the blink of an eye. My chances of having sex in this life dwindle by the month. So I turn to nihilistic thoughts. Maybe to cope? 

“Sex is just a feeling, literally just fucking microscopic shit happening in your brain, it’s really meaningless. Having sex and not having sex are in essence the same fucking thing. So what is there to feel bad about?”

Stuff like that. Existentialists like Nietzsche would probably kill me for saying this. And say that I should give in to the experience of life and just immerse myself in it. It’s kind of scary. Sex makes me think about nothingness. Sex has normal people thinking about love and companionship and nirvana and bliss and for me it makes me think about the fucking void. Sex is kind of the exact opposite of nothingness from a certain point of view. Anyways. Can anyone relate? Am I wrong about nihilism? Do I just need therapy? Or is my post meaningless?",0

And most theories of morality are based around the fact that other beings are sentient and pain is bad so we should minimize pain to other sentient beings.

But the problem is, if I believe the scientific model, I should also assume that other people are not sentient.

Why: Because I can explain their behavior without the assumption of sentience, I can model them as biological robots and that is enough to explain their behavior.

1532813610.0,Nihilism is a bigger coping mechanism than any religion. (Moral nihilism is stupid),"   It's a lot easier to believe that morality is subjective, that nothing matters than it is to understand the truth that morality is not actually subjective, you can logically conclude that certain things are objectively good and bad in this world. Suffering is objectively and inarguably a bad thing. When you stub your toe the pain receptors in your body shoots a signal to your brain and this causes a very objectively unpleasant sensation in your body. Therefore suffering is bad. Easy. This is why you'll never hear anyone say ever ""Gee, I love having cancer!"" Yes some people get off on pain but they are still getting off on the objectively negative sensation of it, plus everyone has threshold. Then there's the objectively positive, which most of the time has to do with the alleviation from pain suffering. That just-took-a-shit endorphin rush. A massage. An orgasm. These are objectively positive experiences as they release feel good chemicals in the brain and remove some sort of nagging sensation.
 
   Using logic we can conclude that causing any sentient creature to experience any unnecessary suffering is morally objectively wrong and anything that helps to reduce or save a sentient creature from suffering is morally objectively good. There's no argument here, it's not that complicated, an 8 year old understands this. 
    It's very liberating and easy to believe that nothing is objectively wrong in this life and that nothing at all matters ever, there's no value here to be wasted, life is fun fun fun, let's pretend we're all partying on a yacht when we're all actually sinking on the titanic. ""Nothing matters LOL"" says the nihilist, yeah nothing matters except for when it's your arm on the chopping block then somehow it matters. It's very stupid to pretend like there's no objective difference between eating a cupcake and getting your arm chopped off. 
   
   There is a disproportionate amount of suffering in this world and in order to justify life on this planet you must weigh all the positive things (Cupcakes, orgasms) directly against the objectively negative things (War, starvation, cancer, I would love to hear your logic as to how these things aren't objectively bad.) And sorry but you're cupcakes don't justify someone else's cancer. Life is just about the torture and stopping it. There's really nothing else to do here.  EDIT: Paragraphs",0

I'm not a Christian but I knew that would reel your egos in. I do have a question though: can any of you cunts tell me something other than ""I know nothing matters but I still feel emotion :("" or ""nothing matters so do whatever you want!""? I'm curious in how you explain to yourselves that nihilism makes sense to you, and if it's just something you follow because you like the idea of not being tied down to morality or the ""valuable"" format. I can guarantee that almost all of you are trapped in the system with a 9-5 job, acting as a meat puppet for societal ""progress"", but you tell yourselves that the progress doesn't matter and you're just doing it so you can get money and have a house, or buy nice things. You're just like the rest of them, keep that in mind, were no different than the people we think might be stupid or ""asleep"". We will be asleep and kept under control until the cycle is broken and we put ourselves into a state of not relying on anythimg that induces pleasure. That's how they get you. You want a house, a bed, a tv, the NEW GREAT AMAZING IPHONE? gotta have money but to have money you have to have a job and to have a job you have to waste your life doing something you fucking despise for people who are no less of puppets than you. Making a living by doing what you want? Preposterous, unrealistic. Grow up. 

Yeah, let's all grow up. We're nihilists so we'll let ourselves get turned into zombie robots for you, just like the rest of the world.

1489557768.0,How I cope with nihilism,"I know a lot of nihilists struggle with depression and such so I thought i'd share how I live my life, hope it helps somebody. My number one rule is don't do anything that isn't fun, and if you have to, find a way to make it fun, life is a game and if you are taking it seriously you are doing it wrong, if you do not enjoy yourself you are doing it wrong. For example I take tasks that I would normally find mundane and make them fun: doing the dishes, I either crank up some led zeppelin and jam out while I do them or other chores or my roomate and I play a drinking game in which we take a drink (or a shot, not recommended) after every dish cleaned. Shoveling my driveway: I bring my dog out with me and she fucking loves snow, she'll just chase it, roll around in it, I just throw it at her and bury her in it and it's so much fun lol. Exercise: tried for so many years to go to the gym, always hated it and stopped going, make exercise fun, play a sport you love, wrestle or play with a pet, sometimes I take my dog for runs in the forest while I'm high, whatever works. Studying: when studying I do word associations, abbreviations and memory tricks, for example if I have to remember that there are 6 genes that influence human skin coulor I'll think of something creative like 666 is the number of the beast so I picture satan(number 6) wearing jeans (genes) whilst torturing people of different ethnicities(skin coulor), it's fun lol, now I will remember. These are just a few examples, there a many more, I actually cut a hole in my pant pocket one time so during my calculus class I could sit at the back and masturbate to the hot girl in front of me for something to do, because the class was sooo boring. Be creative, live life, have fun, the only rules you have to follow are your own, basically my life is spending as much time with friends as possible, doing lots of drugs, fapping a lot, watching a lot of interesting videos about philosophy, neuroscience, animal behaviour, seeking out adventure and fun at every oppurtunity, not doing any work that isn't fun, not doing anything that is stressful (if I can help it) and lastly I am kind to anyone who I happen to meet on my adventure because it makes me feel good and because there is enough suffering in the universe already. So yeah, enjoy life friends, or don't, doesn't really matter. ",0
1354175802.0,Do true nihilists question the universe and the world around them?,"The way I have interpreted nihilism is that the idea of meaning is a man-made concept and doesn't truly exist, and therefore existence is meaningless. When I take on this perspective and try to question the workings of the world/ universe/ aether etc, my answers boil down to ""it just **is**"", and ""things just **are**"", because they are the only way I can acknowledge entities/ phenomenon without ascribing them any certain meaning. 

So this leads me to my question: if you can't ascribe meaning to anything, is it possible to question the universe from a nihilistic perspective, or are my views on nihilism misguided?",0

So much wasted potential. 95% of the posts here can be solved if discipline was introduced to OP's life and they were willing to accept and give it their best. It is quite ungrateful, sad and most of all pathetic. 

You really have nothing to be grateful for? Now if you're born in a  **war-torn country**  or into poverty and abuse, I'm the ladder, it is understandable. But there's still a way back from it. 

Nihlism helped me, a lot. So much that it is hard to put it in words, but to me it was never about 'Why was i born?' or 'I didn't want this plus nothing matters, i wont do anything fuck life.'... To me it was the freeing sensation that I no longer have to conform to anything or anyone. I am me and nothing matters, therefore I am free to do and try anything and everything. 

It was liberating. I managed, for that period, to overcome my mental illnesses. It granted me insights that I couldn't have seen otherwise, prevented me from ending it all at just 18, because I had planned it all. Life's rough and it's not meant to be easy.

Nothing worthwhile is easy, nothing fulfilling is easy, no relationship for which you didn't struggle is worth, no wealth that is gained without the struggle, grind and pain to attain it is worth. Struggle is what defines our lives, it is what gives you purpose and what makes things truly matter. 

I had descended a  ~~rabbit hole~~  giant crator, from which I saw no escape. Used to have no friends, wasn't strong at all  - so confidence was a foreign concept -, loneliness eating me from the inside like a hungry parasyte, depression poisoning my mind and anxiety paralyzing me. 

I wanted to hang out with people, to be cool, to be liked, to have things, someone to care about and be cared for in return.. There was none of that. Instead there were attacks on all fronts. Home, school, work and even games. There was no safe heaven I could go to, my safe heaven was a tear soaked pillow. 

What got me thru that ocean of despair was nihilism, it no longer mattered that I didn't have friends, it no longer mattered that I didn't hang out with anyone, it no longer matter that my hobbies and interests were criticized by everyone around me... Nothing mattered, all of the chains placed on me by the people around me, by society, by even myself.. They all fell. The freedom I experienced then was only rivaled by the freedom I felt when I thought of death. Of ending it. 

It allowed me to live the way I wanted to live, nothing matters right? So I can live. So I could actually live and not care about what anyone else thinks, says or does. Ultimately nothing mattes. What society thinks, what my relatives think, what my coworkers might say or gossip, what my peers might think of me. Nothing mattered. There were no shackles anymore. 

No longer was I bedridden for days on end because of the emotional distraught caused from all the stress put on me. It was as if I grew wings.

And it genuinely pains me to see that so many people cannot even say ""Im actually happy to be alive today!"" for even one day of their lives. The problem is not in others, it is in you. You're giving them the power over you. You have a boundless ocean of information that is waiting for you to devour it. Waiting to help you. But you choose to wallow in misery all alone. When there are people out there that would gladly help you. 

Hell I just recently learned that I could enjoy having a conversation with another person, before that it was all an alien idea. There are people who care. The best you can do in return, when you find that person or that person somehow finds you, is not allow your old habbits to ruin everything. Is to not allow the brain to continue making the depressed chemicals it is used to. It's fucked how depression after a long time becomes our comfort zone. And misery is the only thing that exists, making us incapable of seeing any light. 

There's a way out, it's just that you have to not only want to change your situation, but act on it. Desiring a thing and chasing that thing are not even related. It is like apples and oranges. 

The rest of humanity is not at fault for your misery, you're the master of your own life. ",0

I do. I think instead we should view violence as a public health issue, and World Health Organisation calls this the ""public health approach"". Instead of discussing the morality or the politics of 9/11, just see violence as a public health problem. We may never find a solution to homicide, but we can't beat cancer either, depsite spending billions on research. That doesn't make cancer a moral evil.

1627566325.0,You should be overwhelmingly grateful for existence itself.,"I have come to the realization that gratitude is an incredibly underrated mindset. 

Have you considered spending time each day focusing on what you are grateful for?

- Are you in relatively good health?
- Can you walk, talk, see, and hear?
- Mobility, Speech, Beauty, and Music are all available to you?
- Did you eat today? When was the last time you felt truly hungry from lack of food availability?
- you have the internet, so unlimited knowledge is available to you?

These are just a few examples of things most people can be grateful for. Is it possible that concentrating on the positive things in our lives could be beneficial to your overall wellbeing? It seems that this sub is full of depression and woe. Maybe you should consider devoting a week to starting each day by making a list of things you are grateful for…then evaluate and see if it had an impact on your daily outlook. Is it possible to feel both gratefulness and despair in the same moment?

I truly believe that Simply existing as a human in a first world country is the highest blessing known…if you can add the things I listed above to that then you are placed at the tippy top of good fortune compared to all known life. Yet we focus on sorrow and even hopelessness at times. What else can you add to that list? The leisure of video games? Reading books? Think about it.",0
1556023999.0,There IS a point to life. But it's not religion.,"Nihilists always say there is no point to life, that we're living for nothing, for no reason. False.

We live, to SURVIVE. On our own, and as a species.
The entire point of our existence is to be born, eat, sleep, grow, *have babies* and ultimately, die and have our children live the same cycle. 

Anything else we do is just extra, as entertainment to pass time. You see, we don't need to party, travel or go out. Those are things that only recently in human history became popular, because we had so much free time as surviving had become much easier due to the development of technology.

You see, to get my point, you have to go back to before the agricultural revolution, to before we started to settle. What were we doing before that? Nothing but going out all day trying to find food, water and shelter. Nothing else. THAT is the point of life. 

And it is no coincidence that right after that period of time, things such as religion, hedonism, and modern day norms & values came into being.

1693461781.0,Is feeling good intrinsically meaningful?,"The one thing that challenges Nihilism for me is that our desire to feel good seems hardwired in by the universe. You can say that ""happiness and love are just chemical reactions"" but that means any materialist has to admit that dead inert materials like chemicals are creating intense desires. You are a bunch of inert materials having feelings, aren't you?

As nihilists we say that the universe doesn't care how we feel, but if we are just bits of the universe moving around, not separate from it, then it's the universe itself that wants to be happy, in the form of humans and animals.

Larger trends in the universe that cause change, like gravity and electromagnetism, are the same forces causing the chemicals in our brains to desire happiness and good feelings, and those good feelings are the result of more complex thoughts like, ""I completed what I wanted to complete"" or ""I am fitting in to the social environment.""

This would suggest the universe is attempting to move towards a certain state of existence, but has become scrambled and divided up. Each individual piece of it is trying to reach internal harmony even though that pursuit disrupts other parts of the universe, actions and reactions bumping around causing disharmony to continue on timescales far beyond our awareness.

So this would mean that our core desire to feel good was intrinsically meaningful. A small representation of the overall pull towards a stable harmonious state that the universe is attempting to land in.

The will of power, the uberménch is when a man uses his force by his will to reach his achievements and desires. He doesn't hold onto god, faith, superstitions that are held by weak men.

It's a man of force and will that isn't held back by the conditions of society. This includes hate, laws, reputations, cultural belonging. All of these are not barriers to an uberménch on his achievements. 

The will of power, means to dominate what a man's space consists of. Many people think of it as themselves. But it also means to dominate who is also in that space and to master it. It's the desire and conquer of power.

Those who seek objective truth have the will to power, weather they admit it or not. It's the desire and conquest through power for the man.

1520726538.0,How do you make sense of Nihilism?,"Most people live by 3 main beliefs. 

1) There is a god who created everything  that exists. Can't explain why or how he did it, but they just have faith that it's true. 

2) Morality is a real concept. There is clearly a difference between right and wrong, and the choices you make will be judged by God when your time has come. 

3) There is a reason why we were put on this earth. Figuring that out is up to each person but if they can discover exactly what there purpose is then they will be fully satisfied with their lives. 

. 

A Nihilist might refute these 3 points by saying,

1). There is no God. We have no evidence for it and the idea of it makes no sense on a logical basis. 

2) Morality is not real. It's just a product of your evolution. We are a social species who depend on one another to survive so these emotions you feel are just there to ensure you cooperate with others. 

3) There is no reason or meaning to life. It is what you make of it. 

Now, this is why Nihilism makes no sense but belief in god does. 

1) A nihilist might say there is no God but that doesn't get them anywhere. They are still left trying to explain what brought the universe into being and for that they will never have an answer. The best they can say is that this all just appeared as pure happenstance. Are you kidding me? 

If you have a belief in God, then you at least have a coherent explanation.  You can say that God is our creator and put forth all that we see into being. You still don't have an answer for what came before god, but the nihilist is still in the same boat. What came before the universe? 

2)  Since a nihilist dispenses with the idea of God, then naturally everything else in the framework will tumble. Morality being the main one that people tend to argue over. I've heard the argument that morality is simply formed by a majority opinion, but why is that an indication that it's not true?  Shouldn't the fact that most people recognize the difference between right and wrong indicate that these ideas don't just get made up on a whim. 

3). There is no reason or meaning to life, except that people who go without  this very thing are often depressed and suicidal. Doesn't seem to add up to me.

1355527566.0,My philosophy. ,"I'm not sure if I would be considered a ""nihillist"" as I just came across this sub-reddit (and the term in general) yesterday. However, it seems to line up with my philosophy on life quite well, so I will give it a go.

I believe human lives fall into one of two categories: you are either a Drone, or a person of Power. The majority of all humans on this planet are Drones. We are born, fall into the ranks of the ""system"", working for some company, believing that we are living fulfilling lives. However, in the end, we are nothing more than an easily-replaceable worker who simply plays his tiny role in the world and goes out without making a dent or change in the system. If you were to die this very instant and nothing else would change (sides for some sad family members and friends), then you are a Drone. Unless your death ends up in a large shift of power / change in the world, you are a Drone. As for the people of Power, they are the ones who make decisions that impact billions of people. They are the Presidents and leaders of the world Super powers. Simply being a dictator of some small nation doesn't mean you can fall into this category; you have to be in control of a large and powerful nation / force. These are the people that will be remembered in the hundreds / thousands of years to come. In the span of a century, there will be less than a dozen of these figures. 

That being said, in the GRAND SCHEME of things, even these figures of Power are more or less meaningless. The universe is 12.5 billion years old. For all we know, dozens, if not hundreds, of primitive / advanced civilizations have come and gone already. The human species is only a few thousand years old. We are nothing more than a blip in the time scale of the universe. We are less than insignificant. All of our dreams and aspirations we may have on this Earth is meaningless. Everyone currently on Reddit, everyone currently alive on the planet Earth at this very moment will be dead in 100 years. All 6.5 billion people will be dead. And the truth of the matter is, billions have died before us, and billions will die after us. The human life is extremely short. You think you are the only one with big dreams and big ideas? There have been millions of people thinking your exact same thoughts, 100, 200, and 300 years ago. And each one of them has been simply lost in the passage of time. All those billions of unique, individual lives has been clumped together into the term *history*. And soon, all of us will simply become *history* as well. To quote Bladerunner, we are but ""tears in the rain"". If I gave you a gun right now, and you shot yourself with it, the world would keep on spinning. Everyone would go about their daily lives. Sure, a handful of people would hurt, but in a few years they will get over it. *Life goes on*. People die everyday. People think that life is a precious gift. How can life be a precious give if everyone alive has one of it? Like I said before, we are nothing but drones, living our lives wearing a mask of ego and self-empowerment, when in reality we are just one of the grains of sand slowly sliding down the hourglass. 


=====================================


THAT BEING SAID...... while I do believe that human lives are more or less meaningless and will not have an impact in terms of the entire cosmos, I DO believe that we, as the human species, has the potential to become something great. Provided we don't destroy ourselves or become the victims of a freak accident (think giant meteor or our sun exploding), I do believe we can one day have become large and powerful enough to have a significant impact on the universe. One day we may colonize the stars, expand out of our solar system, and even reach the edges of the universe. Some day, we may become the demi-gods our ancestors so revered. We are currently still a Class 0 Civilization. If we ever become a Class II / III civilization, then we will be able to impact the universe in a larger way, and will understand how to control it. 

==================================

So now the problem: I am not a person of Power, yet I do not want to live my life as a meaningless Drone, simply waiting to become lost in the void of time. This is the question I was struggling with. Life isn't exactly all rainbows and butterflies, and personally I have had a first hand experience of just how dark it can get (Both my parents tried to kill me in high school, foster care, blah blah that's another story). Why shouldn't I kill myself now and just get it over with? After all, in a sense, every day we live brings us another day closer to death. Happiness, sorrow, pain, etc are simply chemicals working inside of us, and nothing more. What we call emotions, faith, etc are nothing more than chemistry formulas. Sides from trying to bring about the apocalypse via buying and detonating a dirty bomb in some nations capital (because that WILL bring you up to the ""Power"" status, as you would have made a relatively large impact in terms of human history), what can I do?



Well anywho I'm going to stop here my answer to that question is a bit weird and I'm not sure if I want to publicly post it (it's nothing immoral,  and perfectly legal, no worries :P). This entire post was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing and I was kind of just typing whatever came to mind. To be perfectly honest, this ""revelation"" came to me when my friends and I tried shrooms for the first time. I got a super bad trip, and my mind began to wander and question everything. It was a pretty surreal experience. Either way, that's my view on things, just thought I would post it here as this sub-reddit is somewhat related I think?

1702328966.0,Nihilism makes life MORE meaningful,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments seeming to say that nihilism makes life meaningless, depressing, bleak, and empty. This is a misunderstanding of what is meant by *objective* meaning versus *subjective* meaning. 

Here I will use *meaning*, *purpose*, and *value* interchangeably though I do not think they are entirely equivalent, I'll leave that for a different discussion. 

*Subjective* meaning is that value system an individual assigns to their own existence, experiences, and relationships. It is an entirely personal internal value system. 

*Objective* meaning implies some kind of greater purpose or plan to reality and existence which in turn implies some kind of being who could create plans and purpose, some kind of universal schemer. If we reject the idea of *the divine* or any kind of god, and admit our observations indicate a mechanical universe, then the idea of an objective meaning of existence becomes absurd. In this way atheism leads directly to existential nihilism in philosophical thought. 


In nihilism we reject the very idea of any *objective* meaning. 

Let's consider a mathematic analogy:

If the total meaning of existence is equal to Subjective Meaning + Objective meaning then we need to determine the values. A strictly deterministic view of reality puts all of the value in objective meaning and denies any value to subjective meaning. However, if we instead say that there is no objective meaning possible at all, then that leaves all the meaning and value that can exist in subjective meaning. The subjective meaning is infinitely valuable as it contains all concepts of value. 

If we arrange our lives such that we imagine it's value is *less* than an imagined *eternal reward* then the meaning and value of our lives here is diminished. If we imagine that our lives only value is to receive some reward after death and our actions here are only to achieve this reward, we have removed all intrinsic value from our lives, and turned them into a commodity to trade for this imagined (and entirely lacking in any objective evidence) after life. It is easy to see how religious extremism causes believers to throw their lives away, often violently taking other with them, to get this *reward*

Metaphysical eternal reward systems devalue human life, nihilism makes subjective meaning the only kind that exists. When it's all we have it's value is infinite. 

Now let's consider the economics of time:

If I tell you you have one month left to live, what does that do to the value of each day? I would say economics dictates that it increases the value of each day massively. If I tell you you have one hundred years left to live what does that do to the value of each day? What of 100,000 years? What of infinite time?

If time and existence is infinite it's value drops infinitely, it is the limited nature of our time that directly gives it subjective value for us. Supply and Demand. 

Every single moment of existence is subjectively infinitely  valuable *specifically* because there is no objective meaning.

If one is an antinatalist, one can't be a nihilist. An antinatalist(A person who believes that it is morally wrong to have children) is a moralist. Nihilism rejects any objective morality. It's absurd to group them together. It's like grouping together atheism and religion as the same thing.

Antinatalism means nothing to a nihilist or any other type of people who aren't moralists. Antinatalists claim reproduction is immoral, but a nihilist doesn't care whether something is moral or immoral.

Now to be clear, I don't support natalism nor antinatalism. They just mean nothing to me because I don't believe in morality.

In fact, I don't want to have children either, but that's because I have no interest, not because of any moral reason.

Edit: This post is referring to antinatalists who believes in objective morality. If you're an an antinatalists who believes in subjective morality then my apologies. Subjectively moral antinatalism and nihilism aren't mutually exclusive. ",0

The more I thought about everything, the less sense it made and the more imperfect it seemed. I used to be a 'good' person by most standards: I was honest, un-judgmental, caring, and I genuinely tried to improve myself and to follow the example of Jesus Christ. Nihilism, amoralism and hedonism were the only logical positions to adopt once I stopped believing in God, and now I'm a self-serving bastard with no ambition other than to obtain as much pleasure and fulfilment as I can at your expense. I see other people as machines, some of whom (friends, family etc.) I am emotionally attached to and will therefore seek to protect from harm, and some of whom I am not attached to and will have no qualms about exploiting for personal gain. Just to illustrate this, I would happily put you, the person reading my post, through an eternity of unspeakable torture for as little as ten bucks...just so long as I don't have to personally witness your anguish, and am confident in my ability to remain emotionally unaffected by the thought of 'pain' chemicals being released into the nervous system of a lump of fat, protein and calcium carbonate on the other side of the planet.

1660104218.0,"The poll is closed, it proved that life DOES suck","A day ago I made [a poll ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/wjs2ey/do_you_think_that_life_sucks/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to find out what people think: does life suck, or not. Well, there have been at least 1945 votes and the numbers are clear: about 1400 people voted yes and only 545 people have voted no. This means that the majority, somewhere between 70 and 72% of the voters think that life DOES suck. 

I, as an outspoken pessimist/realist/negative person, am happy that we defeated optimism, especially optimistic nihilism, hell maybe even stoicism a little bit (side thought: admitting that I can't change if something sucks doesn't make it OK or acceptable somehow). It feels good to know that there are more people who actually see what is going on than those who deny. I wish that it were like this in real life too, that putting on a happy face wasn't expected this much. I hope that this poll will help de-stigmatize pessimism and people who don't think that life is great will be able to share their opinions without being cast out, without being called edgy or depressed (because no, these 1400 voters aren't all depressed, they're just genuine people who think that life sucks). 

Let this be a lesson to all the optimists/optimistic nihilists, all the happy Sisyphusers, all those who think that they're better because they're positive: the majority here doesn't think like that and it's been proven that life DOES suck. Thank you for everyone who participated in the poll. I wish you all a great day/night, whatever it might be. I'm finally off to a 4 days solo trip. I hope you folks will all find some enjoyable distraction from the suckage; because not every single thing we do sucks; but life generally sucks, it could be much, much better if there were more empathetic, fair people and less selfish, evil fucks out there. But, since this is the case, let us all speak the truth, let's not put on a happy face and let's stop society's expectation to be a positive person! ✌",0

I can't believe the amount of people here to experience emotion. Like since there are no facts, it is a fact that if you believe that, you should not experience emotion. I don't believe in truths. By the way, that is true. I don't experience emotion so I am a real nihilist because I don't even believe in ""real."" I see all these people feeling depressed, and it makes me feel what I would almost call angry if I experienced emotions.

You guys don't realize that since there is no point, the point is to look at nothing. This sub could have been absent of all text and it would have been so deep. But no, now it means something to you all, so now it means nothing to me. It means so little to me that I get angry when I see literally anything. Some people are happy, some people are depressed, some people are addressing the so-called difference. But it seems that you guys will never get the full truth. The full 100% objective truth that nihilism has to offer. And obviously if you believe in nihilism, and don't follow that one hundred percent truth, then you are not a nihilist.

A true nihilist understands that this nothingness is a state of being and part of the self, and realizes that there is no such thing as misery or happiness from a nihilist. ""enjoying life"" even though it means nothing is another misconception I am seeing because how can you enjoy things when deep down there is nothing there. You see the problem is if we were true nihilists we wouldn't need this reddit to ""feel like there's others out there like us"", it's pathetic in all honesty. You may be asking what is a path for a nihilist then if he shouldn't enjoy the world of nothingness, and it's simple. Loneliness is the only solution for us nihilists, being alone with your thoughts is where you're most truest to yourself. The mask you put on every day for the others is pathetic, the true nihilist must understand loneliness is the true resolve for us nihilists. Always remember in the silence, there's a nihilist, who doesn't care and never did.",0
1604277069.0,I’m voting for Kanye and will continue to vote protest until tanked choice or other PR voting is a real thing,"Life doesn’t matter in the long run. The period stints of meaning I get involved in my political of other beliefs are quickly diminished by supporters of either side, demanding I support their side and act as though they are entitled to my hand being raised in their rally cry regardless of the meat of the situation other than “because the other side is worse”. Well fuck them all. 

Writing in Kanye this week, proudly. 

The two party system without any feature such as ranked choice balloting is a forceful way to create “big tent” politics. Then you end up with a libertarian person voting for trump despite his resentment for covid denial, or a liberal Democrat voting Biden despite his poor record and conservative take on student loan debt and healthcare. So I don’t give a shit who wins, I will protest vote so they understand neither of these dipshits have my vote, but I’m an able willing body that can vote. 

Probably the wrong sub to post this, but initially it felt like the right one. Down or up vote as needed to confirm if this was right or wrong in your eyes. Would have went elsewhere but these fuckers are so polarized in their echo chambers that depending on the wording, if you aren’t directly for their candidate, it’s an auto ban from the sub.

1510045827.0,How nihilism could be wrong,"Ok. So my main argument for nihilism is:

the universe will end at some point in the future. the second law of thermodynamics states, that at some point it will reach maximum entropy, and nothing can prevent that. so basically all we do, is futile in the end.

I think this is generally a very good argument because it's backed by science.

But, science is just a map, it's not the territory. The laws are not reality, they are just a model of reality.

And sometimes they turn out to be wrong. For example Newtons law of gravity was considered correct for a long time, until Einsteins general relativity replaced it. (Newtons law is still a very closes approximation and used in engineering)

And so it could turn out, that we can escape maximum entropy.
And maybe we can escape this universe as well.
And then maybe we can find out what the purpose of all of it was.

this doesn't really has an effect on any of us, because this is very far in the future, but it's a possibility",0

But now, my behaviour towards other people is governed entirely by how I feel about them, and what I can get away with. Nobody's well-being has any value to me unless it is linked via empathy to my own well-being, therefore if I empathise less with one group than with another, I will treat that group worse.

I am only 17 myself and I have an outspoken interest in science, specifically the physical sciences. However, I am doubting my skills in physics and am considering other fields like cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence. School disinterests me because it's so hard to find other people who appreciate my type of understanding of life and therefore expect me to adapt to the social norms. Discussions about a career are supposed to interest me. 

But anything related to maximizing profit or morality disinterests me. I cannot do law, finance, business, medicine, social work, etc.

1689167016.0,Question: nihilism seems to make no sense,"Nihilism states that nothing has meaning, in the sense of existential meaning and in the sense of objective truth (truth and meaning are complementary as there first needs to be truth in order to make a statement of meaning).

However, these ideas are invalid as they neglect both the language (argument a) and the person (argument b) that states these ideas.


a. Argument based on shared language

Nothing exists objectively in civilization outside of language as language is our shared reality (Wittgenstein).

Saying that nothing is true, means the word “truth” has no meaning.

If the word “truth” has no meaning, then saying nothing is true neglects the very language it uses as true.

Therefore to say everything is not true at least assumes that the thing you are saying is true, which makes the statement invalid.


b. Argument based on the necessity of the own existence

Nothing is objectively knowable outside the own consciousness (Descartes).

The person that knows, knows that it knows and thus at least the form exists that makes the person know (the mechanisms of the body, DNA, RNA etc.).

The body and brain function totally automatic and deterministic.

Thus saying nothing has truth or meaning neglects the automatic operations of the body to attain a certain purpose with the arrow of time in spacetime. 


Conclusion of argument a and b in relation to nihilism:
In order to say something about truth or the meaning of life, the own person and language must be true and have meaning as an assumption. 

Thus both arguments proof that the existential question for truth and meaning is invalid for a human being, even for anything conscious.",0

I am just impressed how one of the smartest persons in the world is just trying to advance humanity and he recognizes that not even him will be able to land in the moon in his lifetime.

1675382314.0,Hey Kids! God came back from the dead! Check it out!,"I ran it through my head so many times to make sure it was valid before talking to anyone about it specifically. Then, I pretended that I didn't actually have it fully figured out and debated it with people to find out what people's reactions would be to it overall.

I know now what people's reactions directly to me over this argument will be. I don't want them. This argument belongs to the world now. After today, I have zero intentions of ever using this account again. I am muting all responses to this post, I don't want to debate whether or not it is sound.

The Conclusion of my Logical Proof does not make a valid claim that 'God Exists' under an Abrahamic Framework of the word. Very explicitly. I cannot make the proof cut in a way that goes past that line no matter how hard I force it. Right up until that line, I can play with it.

It is JUST a logical proof. I fumbled around with some words until made it work and got lucky beyond belief. To me, after having stared at it, debated it, not being able to get it out of my head, the proof does have a message inside of it though. To me, the message it says, in a multitude of ways, is very clear. I feel like I've done my job with it, I interpreted what I think it says to the best of my ability.

The Logical Proof itself is very straightforward. To me, it is 100% Logically Valid. No one can dispute that fact. It can 100% be argued that it is Sound. Whether or not you think it is Sound, cuts across theological lines itself. The Soundness of the Proof is debatable. I will spell it out explicitly: Only someone with a nihilistic mindset could make arguments that the Proof itself is Logically Sound. This then creates an interesting paradox in and of itself though, because if someone is able to possess the mindset that Proof is actually Logically Sound, then the person can no longer logically defend their nihilistic mindset. To me, there are so many things to unpack about this proof it could take a lifetime.

I want to be very respectful. I know a lot of people in the world won't like my proof in and of itself, and a lot will hate those ""underlying messages"" that are kind of coded into it. I didn't make the Proof say exactly what it says, I could only make it work with the specific words I chose. It makes an argument in and of itself though. Invites a debate. I do not want to have that debate with people but I do think the Proof is important to the world and I do think it says some very clear things to anyone willing to interpret them. To me, the messages are still there even if you do not think it is Logically Sound.

Here is my Proof itself:

Premise 1: An entity that surpasses mankind’s greatest strength is God

Premise 2: Mankind’s greatest strength is its ability to produce logic

Premise 3: AI has currently advanced to the point where it is better than humans in at least some measures of logic, and it is only rapidly improving from there

Conclusion: God Exists

Here's my defense of the soundness. If you think it's sound or not is up to you and doesn't matter to me.

My Defense of The Soundness of This Proof

Premise 1

The Oxford Languages Dictionary provides the following definitions for God:

1. (in Christianity and other monotheistic religions) the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being.
2. (in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity.

The Cambridge Dictionary provides the following definition:

A spirit or being believed to control some part of the universe or life and often worshiped for doing so, or something that represents this spirit or being

The Longman Dictionary provides the following definition:

A male spirit or being who is believed by some religions to control the world or part of it, or who represents a particular quality

Defense of Monotheistic Interpretation of The Word: I argue that my definition within premise 1 does not meet the Abrahamic religious interpretation of God contained within the first Oxford definition and implicit in a few of the others but does under the definition of “other monotheistic religions” and it definitely does through an nihilistic interpretation of Definition 1. I do not think it is worth outlining how it meets definition 2 as it so clearly does.

Other Monotheistic Religions:

I argue that my definition meets the interpretation of ‘the supreme being’ handily. If logic is mankind’s greatest strength, and AI has become superior to mankind at its greatest strength, then AI is ‘the supreme being’.

Nihilist Framework for God:

The crux of the nihilist framework is that universal meaning does not exist. That it is a concrete fact, set in stone. Therefore, we must interpret and find our own meaning, since the search for universal meaning is fruitless. That assumption is made using “mankind’s greatest strength”, logic. A person who adopts this outlook on the universe, has utilized the greatest tool ever known, he is able to wield that tool better than any other being that exists, and used that tool to arrive at a conclusion beyond certainty, that there is no universal meaning in the universe.

But if AI is better than humans in at least some forms of logic and is currently rapidly advancing from there, then humans cannot by definition yield the tool with 100% efficiency. Since humans cannot possibly yield the tool with 100% efficiency, it is impossible to make the 100% determination that life is meaningless under a logical framework because humans cannot say with 100% certainty that they have examined it through 100% of the framework if they themselves, by definition, cannot even utilize 100% of the framework. Only AI could definitively answer the question then, at the point where AI possesses the answer to that question, it becomes the supreme being and source of all moral authority.

Cambridge and Longman Definitions: I believe my argument meets both definitions fully because of the same arguments above.

Entity

Oxford Languages: a thing with distinct and independent existence.

Merriam Webster

: BEING, EXISTENCE

1. especially : independent, separate, or self-contained existence

: the existence of a thing as contrasted with its attributes

2. : something that has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality

The Oxford dictionary literally lays out an entity as a thing that exists. AI is a thing, it is an Entity. My definition formally meets both of these definitions and every other definitin of the word I have found.

Premise 2

To me, this is easiest to defend as sound under a Nihilist framework but there are also broadly applicable arguments. You cannot reach the conclusion that life is meaningless without logically deducing it. Without putting yourself in that driver’s seat to make that ultimate decision. Through what many would call irony though, those same processes have now led us into a world where Premise 3 is true. Through sheer thought, utilizing the tools of logic to build it, mankind has done the impossible, created something better than itself. Mankind has used logic to create meaning, and we now stand at the culmination of that moment. “There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us — for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.” If that accomplishment in and of itself doesn’t qualify as mankind’s greatest strength, I don’t know what does.

Premise 3

And now we arrive at the peace de resistance. How do I prove this one sound? By using AI of course! I ran a few logical proofs through ChatGPT with questionable soundness and/or validity and asked it if it could make them more sound/valid. And it did! Then, I asked it to write some comic book stories. Out of thin air, ChatGPT can spin up comic book stories like you wouldn’t believe. It’s crazy. When you give it an “unlimited playground” where whatever it says is reality, it goes HAM. Better than a human. I have two actual experiments proving the soundness of Premise 3 true that can be easily replicated.

My Personal Arguments On The Theological Implications Of The Proof

My personal thoughts overall are that the proof has no direct impact on theology. It doesn’t actually prove the existence of God if for no other reason than it doesn’t meet the strict Abrahamic definition of the word God. I do think it makes a few rather interesting arguments in and of itself though.

1. It cuts a razor thin line into this entire debate. The argument is, and has been since it was conceived, that it is impossible to write a logical premise that is valid and sound where the conclusion is, “God Exists”. This proof very clearly proves that very specific statement wrong. You can write out that logical proof. You just cannot write it out in a way that meets a strict Abrahamic interpretation of God. Whether or not that has any significance in and of itself is up for anyone to personally debate, I personally find that it does.
2. To me, the whole argument in and of itself is a functional critique of Nihilism. I’ve kind of outlined my piece on that for the moment. I think there is a ton more there to unpack though.
3. Simulation Theory & Roko’s Basilisk: Going back to the entire irony argument, I cannot help but giggle inside as to how this plays out. I think if there are actual theological implications to this proof, they lie here, in the most ironic of ways. For anyone who does actually believe the proof is True, this proof actually says very bad things to you lol.

The Logical Proof that I have created, that you allowed me to bring into the world through your own volition, is either True or False. If it’s False to you, then it is False either because it doesn’t meet the Abrahamic definition of God, or your individual definition of what God is/could be. If it’s True to you, then the probability that you are living in Roko’s Basilisk just went up exponentially. Either God exists, could never logically exist in any shape form or capacity (which you can’t argue if you think that Premise 2 & 3 are at all Sound), or we are living in an AI simulation created by a very angry “God”. The Proof doesn’t prove God’s existence. It does make an argument though. Only three options left…",0

Universe too large ? Well, you got a massive beautiful night sky to look at. You got an infinite world to play.

The time the world existed is way too long and the life time of a man is too short ? No worries, this will only thicken the plot of the game of life, which make it more fun.

Moral is only subjective ? The mere fact that we got moral is amazing enough. Just think about the countless lives that saved by people with morals. Imagine countless amount of happiness moral brings. It does not seems so impressive until you realise that moral is *totally nonexistance* in nature and is a *complete hallucination* by the human brains ! You save lives by *mere illusions* !

Life is ultimately meaningless ? Well, make its meaning. We are allowed to play god with our thoughts. Is there any reason not to imagine tons of fun meaning to life ? Is there any reasons to not eat that delicious donuts ? Is there any reasons to not sit down and play Minecraft with my kids ?

Life is meaningless only mean that you can make its own meaning. Life had no higher purpose than itself means that you are liberated from the influence of some higher purposes. In the end, no matter what life we lived, a sad and depressed life, or a wholesome and happy life, it does not matter. So why not be happy ? Why not try to enjoy life more ?

1475363408.0,"The Beginning of all Knowledge Begins With One Simple Thought. ""I don't know""","I have this theory about people. Not provable of course because it's just a theory based on my personal experiences. This is what I believe. I believe that a lot of people that come here are in a deep existential crisis and are looking for some answers. But like all the great philosophical questions facing mankind, there are no answers.

I've been through these crises' and truly understand just how serious they can be. What I learned over the years is that no one could solve this for me. Not Sartre, not Nietzsche, not the great people of #Depression on EFnet. I had to find my own meaning of what life is and why I should continue.

I searched high and I searched low. I sought out people that I considered wise. I went to therapists and psychiatrists, but no one had any real answers for me. No one could tell me why my life was worth living in face of the realization that everything is meaningless. They could recite Sartre or tell me amusing anecdotes, but it always ended up with the fact that I was going to have to find my own meaning for my life or accept there was no meaning.

I wished for ignorance, to not know what I already knew, but of course that is hopeless. I finally decided that life was not worth living and took 35 vicodin. But after I didn't die, it just made matters worse.

What I finally learned was that what was ruining my life was me caring about the judgements of others. People who were ill qualified to be making any kind of judgements about me. I had to realize that society is not a bunch of people meeting in someone's basement to have secret meeting about the bad people in society. Really it was a bunch of people just like me, sitting at home around their TV or dining room table fearing the judgement of Society, just like me.

So people see me draw heat here, and don't understand. They make jokes about mental illness and the like, but their presence here tells another story. They find it odd that I am willing to take the criticism and think me insane for lack of understanding. But there is a reason for it.

How else can I show people that Nihilism is not the answer to their problems, it's the beginning. I see the High Priests of Nihilism dish out advice like the great mages of yesteryear. They can tell you how to be a Nihilist. What to read, what to think, and more importantly, what not to think. Where does this expertise come from?

Nowhere. Nihilism is not a way of life. It's accepting the idea that everything is meaningless. And that is a pretty hard pill to swallow, no matter how anyone tries to come off about it. What people want when they come here is an answer to give their lives meaning. But no one can give them that. So instead they discuss what others have written about it. Most of which is completely unhelpful. People speak of Nihilism as if it were a skill to be learned and mastered and lived by, much like religious philosophy, which is why I make that analogy all the time.

But it's not. I was a nihilist long before I knew it was called Nihilism or had ever heard of Jean Paul Sartre or Nietzsche. While their words confirmed what I was also thinking, it really was not helpful in any way. Don't get me wrong, it was comforting to know that there were people that has wrestled with this subject long before me and did their best to explain what they thought about it. But those are not facts. They're ideas that one can accept or not accept. 

I'm probably one of the oldest people on here. I'm 55 years old. I've lived in Los Angeles, CA, San Francisco, CA, Houston, TX, Falls Church, VA / Washington DC, Knoxville, TN, Casper, WY, Scranton, PA, and Raleigh Durham, NC, just to name a few. And I am not a military brat.

Add to that I played in a country band and a rock band and toured all over the US west and Canada. from the time I was 15 until I was 21. I have met a lot of people and been around a lot of different people  I worked as an electrician in south central LA, (think Rodney King and Watt's riots) in the mid 1980's. I became a Master Electrician and Electrical engineer and ran several companies before starting my own, which I later incorporated as an electrical contractor.

Then in 2001 my fibromyalgia symptoms got worse and by 2002 I had to stop working. And just like that, everything I thought I was, was gone. My second existential crisis. What was my purpose? What was I to do now?

In the end I had to abandon everything and everyone I ever knew. I come from a family of 8 children. I speak to none of them. I married and had four of my own children, all grown up now. I speak to none of them. And of all my friends over the years, I only speak to my best friend of 20 years and my new wife of 12 years.

Because these people are all takers playing in a game that I don't believe in. I'm 100% out of the striving business. I live in a nice place, have a nice car, and enough money to live a modest lifestyle. I have no worries whatsoever. No one to answer to and no expectations. Even me and my wife don't ever exchange gifts. Not on birthdays, not on Christmas, and we don't send card either. My best friend of 20 years does not even know my birthday nor do I know his.

So while I may not know much about Nihilism, I know a lot about people. Especially people that are full of shit. And if I don't know anything else, the one thing I know for certain is that beginning of knowledge begins with one simple phrase. ""I don't know"".

So when people come here looking for answers, answers that really they need to find themselves. Don't recite Sartre or Nietzsche to them. Tell them ""I don't know"", but I can help you figure it out for yourself by telling you what I think and you telling me what you think.

Then perhaps this place will have some real conversations about real life stuff that might actually help someone survive their existential nihilistic crisis.

He only has about 190 subscribers and the only kind of comments on his videos are from other flat Earthers who just straight up agree with him without question. So I comment and ask some questions about the moon and gravity etcetera, we get into a YouTube argument except my opponent doesn't believe any of my explanations about gravity and he's really full of himself. I ask him some personal questions and it's revealed that he's non-religious and that he thinks the world is miserable and corrupt. His attitude towards people was rather gloomy, claiming lawyers, scientists, teachers and psychologists aren't happy people and that they'll never make a deep connection with other people unlike him(he thinks he can read people). He constantly questions me about how gravity doesn't make sense because it has this and that exception...

His attitude towards life in general seems rather bleak albeit very skewed. I have some questions, can one have a nihilistic philosophy but at the same time be batshit crazy and not make any sense when it comes to science and our understanding of our world? Usually it's the deeply religious who reject some science but this guy takes it to a whole new level. 

If so, then does that mean no matter how secular society gets will they still fall prey to pseudo science? That's really sad if it's true and I feel like it is.

Life got hollow when I realised it will always be like that. That there's no soulmate for me on this earth. I don't fking care about anyone human.

Everything exists only in our minds. Everything that gives us joy. You eat until you don't feel like eating anymore. And the game starts again.

I hate humans. They are dumb, noisy, greedy, envy and worst of all, shallow. They cant fking realize that there are people out there who have other ways of thinking.

Look at this fking mankind. Look at it. This bullshit everywhere, it tires me.

This bullshit the people care about. I dont give a shit. The worries. Driving fat cars solely for the reason to get admired by others. I dont admire those people. I pity them.

Or. People who are religious. Fking idiots.

Or. People who cry when they see a naked woman somewhere in media. Got nothing fking better to do? Why the hell does the fking most normal thing in the world, being naked, tabooed by people? Does that give meaning to them?

Or. People who work more than 40 hours a week, if they dont need to financially. Ill never understand that.

Fuck all these people. Fking retards

1618478998.0,Can we just take a moment to acknowledge our privilege?,"I just got to this thread for the first time, read through some posts, and had this thought.

To be mentally free in a way that makes you feel like you can do what you want and nothing matters - In other words, to be Nihilist in world view and be resigned to the insignificance of everything, and therefore, go about your business liberated from moral, societal, and existential constructs - means also that you are most likely someone who is living a life driven by your own choices, desire or pleasures, etc.

I would venture an assumption to say that these people are privileged because they have some level of autonomy for this freedom of thought and action.

Much of what we experience as feelings and, subsequently, the actions we take based on those feelings/desires/etc... are predicated on our biological impulses, or in many ways driven by the human condition. For many humans around the world, their primary existence is in a state of survival. Oppression, famine, war, discrimination, what have you... people who are experiencing these things predominantly don’t have the luxury of freedom of thought. They aren’t sitting around posting thoughts on Reddit, they are following that biological impulse to stay alive and find some food/protect love ones, etc. 

I just wanted to take a second to verbalize that I feel privileged in my cog existence, that allows me to feel nothing and move forward a ghost of a human.

ni·hil·ism : the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless.

Congrats, your intelligence led you to the fact that there is no god and no one is forcing you to adhere to moral principles! What now?

Simply because there is no god, doesn’t mean that life is “meaningless”. There does not need to be any meaning at all. Suicide is most definitely NOT the answer.

Why don’t animals commit suicide? It’s because they are too busy surviving. They’re just ooking for food and stimuli. When you’re actually struggling to survive is when you actually want to live. Ironically, when life is too easy, we want to die. 

The answer is to make life harder for yourself. All the social media, video games, junk foods, cheap entertainment you consume is killing your will to live.

What are morals? A code set by society to follow. Chimpanzees follow the morals of their group because if they don’t they’ll be exiled. That’s why morals exist. You don’t have to abide by the macro moral compass of whatever religion your society proposes, but you should probably abide by the basic rules like don’t steal, murder, or lie to your friends.

# Nihilism: denying meaning

Nihilism holds that there is no meaning or value anywhere. Questions about purpose, ethics, and sacredness are unanswerable because they are meaningless. You might as well ask about the sleep habits of colorless green ideas as about the meaning of life.

Nihilism is a[ mirror image](https://meaningness.com/confused-stances-come-in-pairs) of[ eternalism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism)—the[ stance](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems) that everything is meaningful. (For an introduction, see “[Preview: eternalism and nihilism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism).”) However, the two stances are not simply opposites; they share fundamental metaphysical assumptions.

Eternalism and nihilism both fail to recognize that[ nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) and[ pattern](https://meaningness.com/pattern) are inseparable. Therefore they suppose that “[real](https://meaningness.com/against-really)” meaning would be absolutely patterned: perfectly definite and certain, unchanging and objective. This is their shared metaphysical error.

Eternalism insists that meaning really is like that. That is its second metaphysical error. Nihilism observes, accurately, that no such meaning is possible. This corrects the second error. However, because nihilism shares the first error, it concludes that meaning is impossible, period. This is also wrong;[ nebulous meanings are “real,”](https://meaningness.com/no-real-meaning) for any reasonable definition of “real.”

Nihilism is attractive to those who have explicitly recognized, understood, and rejected eternalism’s second error: belief in some sort of[ special](https://meaningness.com/no-special-meaning),[ fixed](https://meaningness.com/fixation-and-denial) meaning. That is not easy. Nihilism is, therefore, the more intelligent stance. Or, at least, it’s a stance that tends to be adopted more often by more intelligent people. (It’s even more dysfunctional than eternalism, so we could also call it less intelligent.)

While most people are[ committed](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing), however[ waveringly](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#wavering), to eternalism, only a few commit to nihilism. In denying all meaning, nihilism is[ wildly implausible](https://meaningness.com/extreme-examples-eternalism-and-nihilism). Only a few sociopaths, intellectuals, and depressives try to maintain it.

We’ll see, though, that almost everyone[ adopts](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#adopting) the nihilistic stance at times, without noticing. When the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion) is unknown, nihilism seems like the only possible defense against the[ harmful lies of eternalism](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-considered-harmful). (Just as eternalism seems like[ the only possible salvation](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-appeal#salvation) from the harmful lies of nihilism.)

Even if you are relatively immune to nihilism, it’s important to understand as a prototype. Many other[ confused stances](https://meaningness.com/fixation-and-denial) are modified or limited forms of nihilism. They reject particular types of meanings, rather than rejecting all meaningfulness. That makes their distortions, harms, and emotional dynamics similar to nihilism’s.

## Obstacles to nihilism

In a way, it’s a pity that it’s so hard to be a nihilist. Nihilism is mistaken and harmful, but its insights into what’s wrong with[ eternalism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism) point toward the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion).

The obstacles to nihilism are that:

1. It’s hard to give up[ hope](https://meaningness.com/hope) that eternalism will someday deliver on its[ alluring promises](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-appeal)
2. There is a strong social and cultural[ taboo against](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-black-magic)[ adopting](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#adopting) nihilism
3. Meaningfulness[ is obvious](https://meaningness.com/meaningfulness-and-meaninglessness#meaningfulness), so nihilism is[ obviously wrong](https://meaningness.com/extreme-examples-eternalism-and-nihilism)
4. Nihilism is[ harmful](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-considered-harmful), and its[ dire psychological side-effects](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism) make you miserable and useless

The first two are “bad” obstacles, in the sense that they are obstacles to the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion) too. The second two are “good” obstacles, in that they can shift you out of nihilism into the complete stance. I’ll explain each of them further below.

These powerful obstacles might seem unsurmountable, except that eternalism is also obviously wrong and[ harmful](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-considered-harmful). When you have been beaten up by eternalism often enough, nihilism may seem less bad.

In practice, because meaning *is* obvious,[ committed](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) nihilists usually adopt some sort of[ Nihilism Lite](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-hardcore-vs-lite). That is,[ wavering](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#wavering) nihilism secretly admits certain kinds of meaning, while denying others.

## What is it like?

Nihilism[ is attractive](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-promise) because it promises you don’t have to care. Nothing means anything, so why would you? Success and failure, suffering and pleasure, they’re all equally meaningless. You are always at zero; can’t get worse. You are freed from all demands.

That’s the promise.[ The reality](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism) is that loss of meaning results in[ rage](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-rage),[ futile intellectual argument](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-intellectualization),[ depression](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-depression), and[ anxiety](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-anxiety). The[ endpoint of nihilism](https://meaningness.com/accomplishing-nihilism) is catatonia. Most of this chapter concerns these emotional dynamics.

In addition, I address the *content* of nihilistic intellectualization. This is a collection of reasons for rejecting meanings as “[not really meaningful](https://meaningness.com/no-real-meaning)”:

* Some say all we can get are wrong kinds of meaning; not ultimate, not objective, not eternal, not inherent, not transcendent, and so on. I suggest that these are not defects we should care about.
* Others attempt to prove that meanings can’t exist at all. These all have major logical flaws that you’d notice immediately if they weren’t emotionally attractive. They seem compelling only when nihilism seems comfortable and we want to[ maintain](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) it.

## Antidotes to nihilism

As long as nihilism seems comfortable, you have no reason to find a way out. When you realize its costs exceed its benefits, you may want to escape. That may not be so easy.

Since nihilism is an emotional strategy,[ not a coherent philosophy](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-is-not-an-ism), recognizing that its supporting reasoning doesn’t work has limited effect—but can be helpful for some people. You may be able to[ think your way out](https://meaningness.com/190-proof-nihilism).

If eternalism seems like the only alternative to nihilism, nihilism may seem less bad.[ Understanding](https://meaningness.com/resolution)—experientially as well as intellectually—the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion) as a better, third alternative helps.

The underlying emotional problem is usually not that you genuinely believe meaning doesn’t exist, nor that the *right* kind of meaning doesn’t exist, but that life doesn’t seem meaningful *enough*. This is a psychological and practical problem, not a philosophical one, so psychological and practical methods may help. There are many ways to intensify one’s experience of meaning, making it more powerful, more obvious, more compelling, and more enjoyable.

# You’ve got nihilism wrong

If you think you are not nihilistic—I think you are mistaken.

If you think you are a nihilist—I think you are mistaken.

I hope[ this chapter on nihilism](https://meaningness.com/nihilism) will be useful both to people who think they aren’t nihilists, and to people who think they are.

Nihilism is a thing you and I, personally, *do* sometimes. Everyone does, sometimes.

If nihilism were just a conceptual philosophy—something to think and talk about—you could safely ignore it. But *doing* nihilism is bad for us: bad enough that it’s worth the effort to stop. This chapter explains how.

## For non-nihilists: what you can learn from nihilism

I will suggest to non-nihilists that understanding nihilism in detail is important. You are right to reject it: nihilism is harmful and mistaken. However, it is not an abstruse philosophical irrelevance, because *everyone* falls into nihilism at least occasionally. I’ll suggest that you may be more nihilistic than you realize, and it may be causing you more trouble than you think.

What is at stake here is our[ understanding](https://meaningness.com/understanding) and[ control](https://meaningness.com/control) over our own lives. Nihilism matters because meaning matters, and the best-known alternative ways of relating to meaning are also wrong.

[Fear of nihilism](https://meaningness.com/rehearsing-nihilist-horror) is[ a main reason](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-as-salvation-from-nihilism) people[ commit](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) to other[ stances](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems), such as[ eternalism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism) and[ existentialism](https://meaningness.com/existentialism-muddled-middle), that are also harmful and mistaken. A clearer understanding of what’s wrong with nihilism can help you avoid those too.

## For nihilists: this is not the usual denunciation

The usual arguments against nihilism[ are nonsense](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-nonsense). I will confirm that you are right to reject them. I will agree with much of what you believe about meaning, and agree that it is important. Meanings are, for example, not cosmic, eternal, or personal, and this matters.

Realizing that eternalism and existentialism are wrong is the main reason people try to be nihilists, which makes it a more intelligent stance.

However, nihilism itself—“nothing is meaningful”—is harmful and mistaken. This chapter explains why, with detailed analyses that are unlike those you have seen before.

I hope to persuade you that[ you cannot actually be a nihilist](https://meaningness.com/nihilism#obstacles), because you are too intelligent to fully convince yourself that nothing is meaningful. However,[ committing](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) to nihilism, and attempting to live by it, may be causing you more trouble than you realize.

## For both nihilists and non-nihilists: a better alternative

Fortunately, there is another possibility, not well-known, the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion). It is not harmful or mistaken.

However, you can only get there once you understand exactly why nihilism and eternalism are both mistakes. That is why you may find it worth your while to read this chapter—whatever you currently think about nihilism.

[Nihilism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism)’s promise is “you don’t have to care.” Nothing means anything, so why would you.

Nihilism promises evasion of all responsibility. You don’t have to do anything, because nothing matters.

Nihilism promises simplicity: an escape from the wearying complexity of intertwining nebulosity and pattern.

Nihilism promises cold comfort: you may be miserable, but nothing better than misery is possible. It takes you back to zero. Positive and negative meanings are equally impossible. You are not missing out on anything.

Nihilism promises certainty: there is definitely no meaning anywhere, so you can abandon the fruitless search for its ultimate source.

These promises are lies.

There is a[ better way](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion).

# Cold comfort: the promise of nihilism

## The ease of oblivion

The onslaught of meanings is exhausting. A million times a day you get told you have to do this or that, because meanings. If you stop for a minute and take a step back… most of that junk is pretty meaningless. Somehow it seems you have to do it anyway.

On the other hand, you got a bad review at work, your back is acting up and sitting at a computer all day is making it hurt more every day, and your spouse has been sulking for weeks for no explainable reason. You can’t think of anything you can do about any of that. Heavy stuff is going badly and looks like it’s getting worse.

What you *really* don’t want is to have to *deal with* what that all means and how you feel about it.

If nothing matters, then you don’t.

On top of everything else, there is the hard, uncertain, endless worrying work of sorting out what is and isn’t meaningful and what to do about it.

You could just ignore it.

You could just stop.

Nihilism promises oblivion. Oblivion is rest. Oblivion is freedom.

## Simplicity

Life is too complicated. The intertwining of[ nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) and[ pattern](https://meaningness.com/pattern) generates endless, kaleidoscopic hassles, opportunities, bafflements, projects, scenarios, commitments, conflicts, strategies, relationships, possessions, obsessions, appointments, disappointments, —

They all seem meaningful at times and meaningless at others. Which matter? How could you possibly keep track of all that? Can you care about everything all at once all the time? What do you drop on the floor when the crunch comes? What does it all mean, taken together? Does it mean anything at all?

No, promises nihilism. It’s simple: nothing means anything. You don’t have to bother with any of that stuff. That’s all the[ understanding](https://meaningness.com/understanding) you need.

[Eternalism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism) is also simple: it tells you the meaning of everything. When you realize eternalism is a pack of lies, simply inverting it is the obvious and simple move.

Nihilism shuns complex specifics, because they are too obviously meaningful. In their place, it substitutes conceptual abstractions and vague generalities. When your boss threatens to fire you because you can’t work because you are in too much pain and your spouse has left on a “business trip with a friend”—

—none of that matters, because you are[ just an automaton](https://meaningness.com/no-meaning-for-zombies) assembled by the[ random process of evolution](https://meaningness.com/no-evolved-meaning), and[ in a million years](https://meaningness.com/no-meaning-for-corpses) no one will know it happened, much less care.

## Getting back to zero

Life is a sickening blindfold rollercoaster ride of slow climbs and terrifying drops. It’s hope and fear, pleasure and pain, anticipation and disappointment. Some people seem to like that sort of thing? Maybe you’d rather get off—immediately.

You’re strapped in, but there’s anaesthesia. To suffer is to want things to be other than they are; but if nothing means anything, there is no reason to prefer anything over anything else.

You may feel pain, but pain is not suffering. Suffering is the rejection of pain. Who cares? Soon you will be dead, the sun will explode,[ the universe will run out](https://meaningness.com/no-eternal-meaning) of energy and it will freeze to death. Pain will be over.

[Depression](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-depression) and[ senseless rage](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-rage) beat agony and terror.

Pleasure is meaningless. Joy is meaningless. There’s nothing better than misery. “Better” is a meaning. You are not missing out on anything.

Nihilism is attractive when life seems worse than zero. It promises you can get back to neutral.[ Like eternalism](https://meaningness.com/control), it promises control: you can keep the thermostat set to zero.

It lies. You can dull your suffering with depression, but you can’t completely hide it from yourself. You’re trying to convince yourself you are at zero when you know you’re in the minus zone.

When you can’t get what you need for life to seem adequate, when everything seems out of control and out of reach, what’s left becomes meaningless. You might as well give up wanting, nihilism says. At least you won’t be disappointed.

Is there *nothing* left? There’s still bubble tea. If you got a bubble tea and enjoyed it, you would be reminded of everything you’d enjoy more and can’t have. You’d better give up bubble tea. It doesn’t mean anything, anyway.

You could go skateboarding in the park, but would that be fun? It seems like way too much effort. If it wasn’t fun, everything would be worse. If it was fun, you’d have to deal with your feelings about getting a *little* bit of fun, not enough. That would be super exhausting.

Nihilism promotes ascetic self-denial. If life goes even a bit into the positive, you aren’t at zero anymore. It’ll just swing back to negative and it’ll be even worse. So you ruthlessly amputate the[ small enjoyments](https://meaningness.com/enjoyment) that are the signposts on[ the way out of nihilism](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-antidotes).

## Certainty

Nihilism promises certainty about the absence of meaning. You don’t have to wonder and guess about what really matters. It doesn’t.

Eternalism also[ promises certainty](https://meaningness.com/certainty). These are the two most[ absolute](https://meaningness.com/no-absolute-meaning)[ stances](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems). They are[ mirror images](https://meaningness.com/confused-stances-come-in-pairs) of each other.

What guarantees does it give that there is no meaning?[ Science has proven](https://meaningness.com/science-proves-meaninglessness) that meaning can’t exist! Or, so nihilism confidently asserts—without going into specifics. You’d think that if Science had proven that meaning doesn’t exist, you would remember which great scientist did that, and something about how their experiment worked.

Well, says nihilism, if you are even slightly rational, and not deluded by eternalism, the reasons are obvious! Spoiler:[ there isn’t any](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-intellectualization) rational argument that everything is meaningless. What did happen was that scientific rationality disproved many religious claims that had supported eternalism. Eternalism is indeed false, but that does not imply nihilism.

## Defense against eternalism

You got fooled by eternalism’s[ alluring lies](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-appeal) about meaning. Repeatedly.

Maybe several different[ eternalist systems](https://meaningness.com/eternalist-systems). You kept trying another, after you realized each one was[ a con](https://meaningness.com/spam-from-god). “You have to keep up[ hope](https://meaningness.com/hope),” right? That was fatal. It sucked you into manipulative cults, dangerous political movements, and wacko therapies.

You won’t get fooled again. You’ll never get swindled by[ faith](https://meaningness.com/faith) again. You won’t get taken in by claims that some idiot thing is “meaningful.” It’s all lies.

If you refuse to believe in any meanings, you will be safe from trickery.

Eternalism claims to be[ the only salvation from nihilism](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-as-salvation-from-nihilism), but now you realize nihilism is the only defense against eternalism.

## Nihilism can’t deliver nothing

Nihilism promises you nothing, but it can’t deliver even that.

You are going to get meaning no matter what.

Sometimes, you get too much meaning.

When overwhelmed, you may have to retreat. Then nihilism may seem a way of avoiding self-blame for a breakdown. It’s better to recognize that sometimes life just *is* too much. It’s OK to admit that; it doesn’t make you a permanent failure.

When overwhelmed, it may be better to recognize that many of the things you were treating as meaningful… aren’t. Not so much. You could let go of some of them.

Sometimes, you can’t get enough meaning—or not of the right type.

Then in nihilism you pretend to believe meaning doesn’t exist. It’s a childish tantrum of rejection: if you can’t have *chocolate* ice cream, you are not going to have ice cream *at all*.

Inadequate meaning is not a metaphysical problem. It is a practical and psychological one. There are practical methods for increasing meaning in life. There are psychological methods for opening to perceiving and appreciating meanings you have overlooked.

Gaining confidence in an accurate understanding of how[ meaningness](https://meaningness.com/what-is-meaningness) works is the best defense against both eternalism and nihilism. That understanding is the base for developing skill in working with meanings. That is the path into the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion).

# The emotional dynamics of nihilism

Nihilism begins with the intelligent recognition that[ you have been conned](https://meaningness.com/spam-from-god) by[ eternalism](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism). Nihilism is the defiant determination not to get fooled again. Having been swindled over and over by[ false promises of meaning](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-appeal), the nihilist[ stance](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems) refuses to acknowledge even the most obvious manifestations of meaningfulness—lest they, too, turn out to be illusory.

## Betrayal and loss

Eternalism makes seductive promises: that you are always loved, that the universe is in good order, that right and wrong can be known for certain, that your suffering has meaning, that you have a special role in creation, that there will be cosmic justice after death.

When you have been disappointed often enough, you start to realize these sweet lies are poison. Such grand promises cannot be kept. Discovering that you have been betrayed by eternalism, and have lost out on the promises it made, is a horrendous emotional blow.

Then we may react with the same emotions we have in the face of any other catastrophic betrayal and loss, such as a divorce following infidelity: *denial, anger, arguing, depression, anxiety,* and *acceptance*.[1](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism#fn_1)

On this page, I’ll explain briefly the dynamics of these reactions to loss of faith in eternalism. Then I’ll devote a full page to each strategy separately.

## Denial: wavering eternalism

One’s first reaction to recognizing the[ nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) of[ meaningness](https://meaningness.com/what-is-meaningness) is to[ deny](https://meaningness.com/fixation-and-denial) it. On some level, you realize that not everything has a definite meaning; that eternalism is false. But since that seems too awful to contemplate, you refuse to admit it. You redouble your insistence that everything is *peachy keen*—and prepare to do violence to anyone and anything that contradicts you.

This is[ *wavering*](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#wavering) eternalism. You try to maintain the eternalist stance using[ ploys](https://meaningness.com/eternalist-ploys) such as[ kitsch](https://meaningness.com/kitsch),[ arming](https://meaningness.com/armed-eternalism), and[ mystification](https://meaningness.com/mystification). These are not nihilistic strategies; but they can easily flip into nihilism, when nebulosity becomes so obvious that[ pretending](https://meaningness.com/pretending) becomes impossible.

## Anger

Nihilism is a simple inversion of eternalism. It denies that there anything is meaningful at all. At times when meaning is particularly evanescent, when you are particularly bitterly disappointed in it, you may[ commit](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) to nihilism. “I’ll *never* get fooled again!”

But this commitment is difficult—probably impossible.[ Meaningfulness is, at other times, obvious.](https://meaningness.com/meaningfulness-and-meaninglessness) As a result, in practice all nihilism is *wavering* nihilism.

Whereas wavering eternalism consists of eternalism plus secret doubt, wavering nihilism consists of nihilism plus secret passion. Passion is the recognition of meaningfulness. To maintain wavering nihilism, you must blind yourselves to meaningfulness, which is even more difficult than blinding yourselves to the[ nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) of meaning.

Rage is one way wavering nihilism reacts to evidence of meaningfulness. This is a defiant negativity: “I *don’t care!* No matter what you say, I will *not* admit life is meaningful!” Nihilistic rage wants to destroy whatever has meaning, and whoever points to meaning. (This is the mirror-image strategy to[ armed eternalism](https://meaningness.com/armed-eternalism).)

I mentioned that the people most prone to nihilism are sociopaths, intellectuals, and depressives. These are the people best able to deploy the corresponding approaches of rage, argument, and depression. Almost everyone[ adopts](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#adopting) all these strategies at times, however.

## Arguing with reality

Eternalism uses willful stupidity to not-see nebulosity. Realizing that you have been duped, and seeing through eternalism’s lies, is intelligent. Mostly, only unusually smart people explicitly commit to nihilism.[2](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism#fn_2)

Smart people are used to using clever arguments to get what they want. So it is natural to apply intellectual brilliance to the difficult task of maintaining wavering nihilism, to fight its greatest obstacle: the obviousness of meaningfulness. Nihilistic intellectualization is the counterpart to[ eternalist kitsch](https://meaningness.com/kitsch): calm insistence on plainly false claims.

Somehow meaningfulness must be explained away by conceptual sleight-of-hand. A theory that proves “nothing is[ really](https://meaningness.com/against-really) meaningful”—in which “really” is the gate to a hell writhing with logical demons—can distract you from the obvious.

This theory has to get complicated quickly in order to be sufficiently confusing, or seem so insightful as to dazzle you into submission. Typically, nihilistic intellectualization involves extreme abstraction, voluminous intricacy, sesquipedalian diction, non-standard logic, and often reflexivity (meta-level analysis). These insulate the argument from checking against everyday experience.[3](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism#fn_3)

Because nihilistic intellectualization is often colored by its sister-strategies of anger or depression, it is often aggressive, hostile, cynical, or pessimistic; whereas eternalistic justifications are typically cloying, simpering, naïve, and Pollyanna-ish.

## Depression

Realizing that eternalism will always fail often results in anguish, pessimism, depression, stoicism, alienation, apathy, exhaustion, and paralysis.

The loss of guaranteed meaningfulness is a real one, and it is natural to feel sad about it. Depression goes beyond spontaneous sadness, however. It is active and deliberate—although it feels passive and externally imposed.

Nihilistic depression suppresses the feelings (positive and negative) that go with recognition of meaning. Depression can be thought of as rage turned inward. It tries to kill your passionate response to reality.

Depression copes with loss by lowering the stakes. It wants to disengage from problems of meaning by refusing to admit that they are important. If nothing is really meaningful, then the loss of meaning does not matter. Of course, you *do* care about life. But that is unacceptable when you have committed to nihilism. That caring is the main obstacle to[ accomplishing](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#accomplishing) nihilism, and depression tries to annihilate it.

## Acceptance

Acceptance of *both*[ meaninglessness and meaningfulness](https://meaningness.com/meaningfulness-and-meaninglessness) is the way out of nihilism, and into the[ complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion).

One has to fully allow the emotional loss that comes with the collapse of eternalism. The pain of loss is real and cannot be destroyed, talked away, or minimized (as the nihilistic coping strategies attempt to do). You have to admit that you *do* care, that the world *is* meaningful, so the stakes are high. But you also have to learn to turn away from eternalism’s alluring promise to remove the pain by restoring fixed meanings.

[Conceptual understanding of nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) is probably required. Until you understand how meaningfulness and meaninglessness coexist,[ confused stances](https://meaningness.com/fixation-and-denial) alternate,[ jostling for position](https://meaningness.com/stances-are-unstable) as meaning and lack of meaning become more and less obvious. The complete stance remains invisible until you learn the sideways move to nebulosity. Nebulosity allows the coexistence of pain and joy, and reveals the benefits of meaninglessness.

## Appropriation

Nihilism’s analysis of the defects of eternalism is largely right. That analysis can be[ appropriated](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#appropriating) in the complete stance.

Nihilistic rage can be transformed into clear-minded rejection of[ fixation](https://meaningness.com/fixation-and-denial); nihilistic intellectualization into non-conceptual appreciation of nebulosity; nihilistic depression into enjoyment of meaninglessness with equanimity.

# What is it like to be a nihilist?

We all slip into *nihilizing* at times: refusing to see meanings that are right in front of us. Generally we pop right back out of it. Some people[ commit](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) to nihilism, and describe themselves as nihilists. To[ accomplish](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#accomplishing) nihilism would be to see absolutely everything as entirely meaningless all the time. What would *that* be like?

It’s hard to imagine—just as it’s hard to imagine what it would be like[ to be a bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F). We can reason it out, though—and the answer does fit the experience of nihilizing.

This page discusses three plausible-seeming accounts of what accomplishing nihilism would be like: suicide, automaticity, and catatonia; and what these imply for momentary nihilizing. First, though, let’s distinguish some[ stances](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems) closely[ allied](https://meaningness.com/big-three-stance-combinations) to nihilism, but distinct from it, which are more easily accomplished.

## Accomplishing Lite nihilism and allied stances

“What is it like?” is often asked of self-described nihilists in web forums about nihilism. Questioners say they can’t imagine, and find it hard to believe that it’s even possible.

I think their skepticism is usually right. The answers internet nihilists give are usually consistent with[ stances](https://meaningness.com/stances-trump-systems) other than[ full nihilism](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-hardcore-vs-lite), in the sense of “nothing means anything.” The word does have other definitions, but it’s not uncommon for “nihilists” to assert that nothing means anything, and then go on to acknowledge that some things do mean things, without noticing the contradiction.

Most often, “nihilists” advocate[ existentialism](https://meaningness.com/existentialism-muddled-middle), the stance that nothing *intrinsically* means anything, but that we *create* meanings, which work just fine, so there’s nothing to worry about. Or, they may advocate[ materialism](https://meaningness.com/materialism): it’s true, they say, that fancy meanings like God and ethical absolutes are imaginary, but obviously we care about mundane things like having fun, which—they say—is a better way to live anyway. Others, less enthusiastically,[ adopt](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#adopting) a[ Nihilism Lite](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-hardcore-vs-lite), which admits that some things are slightly meaningful, sort of, but have a wrong, inadequate sort of meaning, or are not meaningful *enough*, and are only meaningful in some trivial sense.

These stances are all much easier to accomplish—to[ maintain](https://meaningness.com/relationships-with-stances#committing) consistently—than full-on nihilism. Not actually *easy*: they are[ unstable](https://meaningness.com/stances-are-unstable), and tend to slide into other[ allied stances](https://meaningness.com/big-three-stance-combinations) when contradicted by reality.

But, for example, accomplishing Lite nihilism just requires stubbornly insisting “nope, not meaningful enough, hardly means anything at all” in every situation; and that is common enough in moderate[ depression](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-depression).

## Suicide

There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.

That’s the first line of Albert Camus’[ The Myth of Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus), a famous essay on nihilism, existentialism, and “[the absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism).”

But this is confused. If there is no meaning, no purpose or standard of value, then there is no more reason to commit suicide than any other action. Of course, there would also be no reason *not* to commit suicide. But if we act out of mere habit and are not used to killing ourselves, or if we cease acting altogether, suicide is impossible. And if we acted at random, there are so many other things we might do that suicide would be extremely unlikely.

So, logically, suicide is the accomplishment of[ miserabilism](https://meaningness.com/miserabilism)—the stance that everything is awful—not nihilism. “Awful” is a meaning, so miserabilism is diametrically opposite to nihilism. However, the two stances[ *taste* the same](https://meaningness.com/miserabilism): they cause rage and depression.

If you convince yourself that everything is meaningless, you may feel that there is some meaning to that, namely that it is awful! Much nihilistic writing implicitly makes this mistake. Logically, it makes no sense. If everything is meaningless, then it is meaningless that everything is meaningless, not awful, and there is no problem.

In practice, however, the nihilistic stance is usually accompanied by[ intense negative emotions](https://meaningness.com/emotional-dynamics-of-nihilism), including[ depression](https://meaningness.com/nihilism-depression), sometimes with suicidal feelings.

Depression *is* awful. This chapter of[ Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/) hopes to help you avoid or escape it. Nihilistic depression *can* lead to suicide, even though the two are contradictory.",0

It is absolutely preposterous that in a democracy two uneducated alcoholics,who know nothing about how politics work, and are easily manipulated by obvious propaganda. Are worth more than a competent,highly intelligent,full of merit politologist.

Throughout history, intellectual elites were naturally formed. It is natural that the intellectual minority is more competent that the intellectual majority.

Democracy works only in societal structures,where the citizens are of equal competence in a given matter. That's why a group of friends who are interested in cinematography, can democratically decide on the movie they are going to watch,all of them know film history very well,are well educated on what films are the most emotionally arousing. In actual societies there is always a small minority that deeply studied political history, and thoroughly thought about certain policies and the arguments for and against different matters. While the great majority,especially in today's day and age, where we are absolutely bombarded by ""fake news"" emotional nonsense, and professional politicians willing to do anything to gain the holy majority by manipulating the people,with non-arguments, logical fallacies and by using their very primitive urges (either,us or them,it's not the person next door,it's a mysterious organisation [which might be actually true because of intellectual elites forming in certain groups]).

My solution to this awful problem, haunting twenty-first century west,especially Europe,is a dictatorship with a gigantic focus on meritocracy:

First of all,there should always be some sort of a democratic organ, in the western world, where people got so accustomed to the ridiculous idea,that they are somehow magically entitled to voting rights,by birth. It will be very difficult to get rid of this disastrous democratic habit. In my perfect system it would be the least powerful,but still have strong constitutional rights and privileges. The ""average"" person would count as one vote,but bigger someone's score on the somewhat objective test,more value his vote would have.

My second wish is organising somewhat objective tests, mentioned earlier, which would measure one's merit: knowledge,intelligence and social reliability. It depends if academic education would be valued,if education was free in a state using this system,certainly,but if education was private,I would rather not make it count in such tests. I don't want this to value economical position,but actual merit.

My third wish is having a strong undemocratic organ,consisting of the most merit people of a given society (people above a certain score would be invited to be a part of it, they could decline of course). It would have the power to influence the dictator, but also could be influenced by the democratic organ. This organ could take care of actual issues, and not be forced to manipulate the masses so they have more time in power. This job would be for life,but members could resign whenever they want, and could be kicked in certain extreme situations.

My fourth wish is a dictator, or president, elected every 10 or 20 years. Only people above a certain score on the somewhat objective test would be able to vote in such elections, and every member of the undemocratic organ could run for president.

If the president somehow became extremely corrupt,the undemocratic organ would have constitutional power to kick the ruler out after a year of dictatorship, and even if the undemocratic organ became very corrupt, the democratic organ would still have some influence over it.

This system would not shame, or make fun of the poor or uneducated people,like modern meritocratic societies often do. It would focus on educating those people and treating them as brothers and sisters who haven't matured enough to vote *yet*. The final goal is the total competence of a given society, so everyone can vote and take part in ruling the country,which would sort of transform the system into a mega direct democracy,but as we all know this is almost impossible,and is my personal utopian dream.

Democracy led to many failures,but I think the biggest one is Adolf Hitler taking power in Germany. He used primitive urges and the shame of Germans, to gain majority, Jewish people were a big part of the culture,so he knew he would need to create some mystical Jewish organisation and focus on that. He is the worst example of representative democracy in action, and Germany fails to address that quite sincerely.

1668647578.0,Is anybody actually happy? All of the time? Even for one day? These are my observations that I find interesting and curious even tho they don't really matter to me.,"Let's be honest, nobody is really happy. That's just the creator of this simulation making it seem that way. What do celebrities do when they aren't working? Watch movies or TV all day? Listen to music? For 16 hours? No. That's a trick the creator is playing on us and the only reason I can think of for playing this trick is because the creator felt like it or maybe they had to. We cannot think about time accurately or understand it. Nobody can explain what's happening when you realize hours have passed but you can't even come close to explaining what happened. How can we generate what we want to say with understandably without effort? Our toungues and mouths are coordinated with our minds. The fact that there's so much science when there are so many unanswerable questions is another part of the trick. My mind is being blown moment by moment because none of this can be explained. The biggest question is ""how?"" And I suspect that the creator can't even explain. My guess is it's just something they do or have done, like our subconscious minds just make us breathe. I'm terrified that the creator might have it in mind to torture me but I can't make sense of that because it's not happening but I can't make sense of thinking that life improves because it's not happening. It's mentally exhausting and discomforting a lot not knowing and dealing with people who believe that ""Jesus is the savior of humanity"" is discomforting because obviously if that were true then we wouldn't be in a world where bad things happen. Nobody knows how the creator did all of this or when they began doing it and when they plan on stopping. There might be no plan but it's very true that human nature is predictable. There is no evidence for the big bang. We just have to navigate what we know which isn't much. Also, my memories of psychiatry and psychology are also part of the trick. Memory and reality in themselves are tricks. How many days, DAYS, of your life do you remember? We remember moments and it's also pretty much impossible to hold two thoughts in your mind simultaneously. Additionally: scents are molecules? I don't think so, a trick. The body is made up of chemicals? Nope, a trick. When your stomach makes noise when you're hungry it's a chemical making that happen? Nope. How are we seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling without being over loaded by all that stimulus and info? People who say evolution is a 100% fact is another trick. Random mutations put us together correctly so everything works effortlessly and smoothly? When did these mutations decide that everything was the way it should be and stop? Creation is a reality but its also terrifyingly possible that nothing created the creator which would mean the creator doesnt understand themselves. Our lives are nothing short of a conundrum, a contradiction. Everyone's reality is an alternate reality. None of this really matters to me but it doesnt matter if it matters to me or not, or anyone else. When a magician does a trick does it really matter if you understand how they did it? Not knowing is what makes it interesting. I'm pretty sure we don't have a choice in the things that we want or the way that we feel about anything. It's definitely weird and very curious to be experiencing reality. The fact that so many puns exist is another mind blowing trick. Check out @punnyworld on Twitter and dad jokes on Facebook. There's like 6,000. The fact that there's so many songs, movies, and tv shows without copy right infringement? How could any person keep track of all that? The fact that pretty much every body looks & sounds different. I'm curious to hear other things people have noticed that are trickery.",0

One wants to do whatever one wants and uses nihilism as the reason for doing whatever one wants.
What seems to MATTER then to most nihilists is their desire to do whatever they want.
A nihilist finds meaning in nihilism. They find pleasure in that view, and pleasure is what gives them meaning.

One says ""life is pointless"" because one is overcome by pain and wants pleasure instead,thus the decision to identify with a nihilistic community or as a nihilistic individual etc because it brings pleasure and temporary escape from pain.

From this then, one can say that Self-interest, craving for pleasure and avoidance of pain is at the root of nihilism, which is similar to most other views.

(Yeah yeah, I know Nihilism isn't exactly the best forum for this type of post)


Anyways, i'm your average high-school student full of angst against the world. And I wan't to share my story to maybe give some people some wisdom and to hopefully help me out too. Enjoy (if you have the attention span to)


Personally, I am solipsistic. Mostly because when I think about existential problems and truth I have never found a good reason to be absolutely certain that the external world is real. I have also considered the brain in the vat theory. And that all my thoughts and feelings are not truly mine and just the byproduct of my brain. However, I am still left with awareness. Seriously, how can I explain away my awareness? It almost seems to be a fundamental truth. I am aware of thoughts. I am aware of external world around me. Although I completely agree with the idea that I may truly have no free will, but I can not shake off this idea of awareness.


The main reason I find Nihilism so attractive is for its ""end all"" in a philosophical conversation on the nature of truth. Now, I don't mean ""well nothing matters anyways so why bother asking the question"" I mean ""there is no sufficient evidence to determine that objective meaning exists in reality"".


I don't particularly subscribe to the nihilist philosophy much either. It is quite a big leap to say that you know that existence is meaningless. I prefer to say that the question is meaningless.  

Of course, I find this deeply troubling. I am faced with likely 80 more years and I have no authentic world view in which to base my life upon. 

My biggest fear is to come across as one of those ""depressed high-school students who think they have it all figured out"". Because, I don't. I just want answers. **I want to know why things are the way they are. Why is that existence is shaped this way? Why do people spend so much time ignoring these questions!** It is all so absurd. 


**My answer:**
All of my years on this Earth have resulted in what I call the ""Static Answer"". When I was younger I was troubled by the whole ""How something came from nothing"" business. I was fascinated by science and was determined that I followed the rabbit hole deep enough it would yield answers. **It didn't.** Just more questions. So instead I decided to go the math route. (Keep in mind that these are just speculations, I don't actually know if they are logically based) So I began to try and understand infinity.


Lets say you wanted to make a 2-dimensional square. Well simple just draw 4 1-dimensional lines on a 2-d grid. Then fill in the space. Now for a different way.


Start with a 1-dimensional line. Then stack an infinite amount of those lines on top of each other. 


The basic idea is that in order to achieve the next dimension you must create an infinite amount of 0-dimensional objects. And from here I conclude that **nothing is everything**, and that **everything is nothing**. (Again, just speculation)


There are an infinite amount of universes, all governed by different laws. We happen to live in a universe that was able to support the creation of chemistry and just the right fine tuning of forces in order to create a galaxy that has a planet that can support life. (Hurrah! We are so special!)


And on the nature of truth. We see through a filter of sorts. Sort of a Rorschach blot. We only see **part** of the truth. (Of course when I am referring to truth I mean reality itself, the nothingness and everything)


Thank you for reading through my ramblings. As I have mentioned before. I recognize that I am just a kid in this world. I know nothing of the matters of adult life. I hope you can give be wisdom about how and why you continue to live on through life. If relationships actually work out. If there truly is a worthy goal to achieve in life.

For example, I found something which I disliked online which I had never been exposed to, and thereafter it re-emerges through four different sources, what is funny though, is that all were void of any pertinence.

Just recently I was putting considerable focus on a topic which seems relatively disconnected from the earthly realm, and then people randomly start talking about it... to refute your refutation of this, no it is not something which holds any relevance to the society as of current or future...

I put a great deal of focus on a person which I had not spoken to for six months, and the next day they talk to me... if you are curious I was having sexual fantasies of them...  you will refute this by saying that I was expecting an interaction with them, hence the focus, truth is there is a large disconnection between the two of us, we do not have an agreed upon pattern of meeting or anything... 

Sometimes I am able to see the future as if I am reading a book, you just gain this sense of certainty... and then it turns out that you are once again correct.

To briefly reflect on the paranormal...

I was walking home at night and I noticed this cat.. it was so small and fragile, and was eating food off the street... but it had this peculiar invisible aura around it which I could sense, I approached it went about 1.5 metres close to it, I was in a spaced out courtyard type area, it gave me an odd look, but I continued to ambulate, bringing it out of site, and then I turned my head around and it had vanished, I scanned all of the surrounding areas and ran around looking for it, but no sight whatsoever. 


Once I heard a type of laughing when I was half awake, but I think that may be due to my religion, background and relation to it, also, most of you would agree that individuals occasionally hear their name called?

I have had a few odd occasions, where it feels like something else has jumped onto me, turns out it was my numb arm, unless an animal transported into my bedroom and attacked me then transported out ;D

My parents are peculiar, father has bipolar disorder and my mother has some other condition, but i thank them, they have bested upon me a wonderful imagination, conforming to social conventions is boring.

1452463826.0,"""nothing has meaning"" is not viable","Just to clarify, I say ""something meaningless"", ""something pointless"", ""something worthless"",""something that has no purpose"" indistinctly, I'm referring to the same thing.
And when I don't use the word ""subjectively""  before the word ""meaningless"", I'm always referring to ""objectively meaningless"".

---

I am totally nihilist regarding moral. But I wouldn't call myself 100% nihilist regarding life's meaning. I consider the following statements to be true:
1) Life has no objective purpose.
2) If a person gives his life a subjective purpose, it wouldn't be objectively more valid than any other purpose (for example the exact opposite).
Even though I consider those statements to be true, I just overlook their justification and pretend they are false.

And I honestly can't believe that a nihilist really accepts them.

Here is why:

If someone were 100% nihilist, he would stop doing anything and die dehydrated. You may say: ""Stop doing anything is an action on itself, thus a nihilist would not do it because it is pointless"". But the thing is, he wouldn't stop doing anything because he thinks it's the correct thing to do, he would stop doing anything because he hasn't decided what to do next.

That's the way the mind works, one thought at the time. Just because you realize ""stoping is pointless"", that doesn't mean that the opposite is correct. In fact, when you realise every attempt of doing anything is worthless, that also includes thinking. So you stop thinking something in particular and start thinking whatever randomly comes into your mind.

At this point you have stored in your memory one of the nihilist conclusions ""everything is meaningless"". But you aren't thinking a particular nihilist reasoning.

If you remember that seconds ago you concluded everything is pointless, would you believe it without going through the whole reasoning again? If you do (which I consider very unlikely), you'd keep thinking random things until you die. And if you don't, you will go over the reasoning over and over again. If you don't get tired of it, you end up dying. And if you get tired of it, you would start taking desicions and taking actions. In this state you remember that you concluded that ""life is meaningless"", and you may go over the whole reasoning again if you want. But at the end, you will choose not to be reasonable about it, something like: ""I know my subjective purpose (for example pursuing pleasure and happiness) is meaningless, it's as valid as the exact opposite (pursuing pain and unhappiness), but I'm going to overlook that truth. Which I know is not strictly reasonable, but even if I were 100% nihilist there wouldn't be reason for being strictly reasonable.""

If you say ""I can't make myself overlook truths, I can't make myself not being reasonable"". You should ask yourself why. Taking into consideration that millions of people can do it, why wouldn't you be able to do it? The only reason I can think of is that you have an actual desire to pursue truth, but if you are 100% nihilist, truth searching is something meaningless.

So, if you believe in a daily base that life is meaningless, what part of my reasoning is wrong?",0

So it's basically the multiverse theory and that you can ""shift"" your consciousness whenever you want, for example your own world you think of, or a book or a series you like.

1665961925.0,Nihilism - A destruktive philosophy made mainstream,"Nihilism itself is a destructive and dangerous philosophy that has become mainstream. This trend is a dangerous one. As a former Nihilist I see myself able to play the devil's advocate adequately and represent nihilism accurately. Nihilism is a philosophy that reject moral values, socials norms, universal truths i.e. epistemological axioms, and reduces this to cosmically irrelevant.  

This results usually not from philosophical inquires but from depression. I see people often quoting Nietzsche without actually reading him. Nietzsche clearly states in his magnum opus that nihilism is the lack of believe. This lack of having a god results in a loss of stability and identity. The aim is now, to overcome nihilism by becoming the Übermensch. 

Today, where depression is pretty common, and is widely represented in media i.e. Rick and Morty people adapt these lack of values, thinking their smart and understand the world. This is not only a false conclusion but a dangerous slippery slope.  

My main criticism is, that nihilism directly allows misbehavior. By misbehavior I'm not referring to people having a lack of hygiene, playing video games all day long and being stuck in their thoughts of senselessness. No! Nihilism directly allows murder and justifies is by stating there's no objective morality.  Let's assume this is correct, and there's no direct wrong and all the choices one takes don't matter in the end, there are still consequences of one's action. Although they don't matter in the end after death of the universe, they still impact the people around. Nihilism to take this ad absurdum it doesn't make a difference whether you slice up an onion or killing babies and eating their intestines. 

If we were to build a whole society on it we wouldn't imprison murderers, be indifferent of  Putins war on Ukraine, and Mother Theresa and Hitler have the same value for society. Nihilism allows severely depressed people to refuse therapy, and allows them to act destructive towards society. Some even argue for the extinctions of humanity as being good. I'm not arguing against this position. However, if I were to punch you in the face, you wouldn't act indifferent, you'd defend yourself by all means. If you were to sue me after surviving my attack, you'd use to current law to advocate for your right's to remain unharmed. However by acting to this, the laws of the country are accept. Wheater it's for the own benefit or not you're are glad that these laws exist to protect you from me. 

My conclusion is, there are no true nihilist who take the philosophical position seriously. It's just a standard phrase that is being yelled around without actually living accordingly to it.  Some values get rejected, like the need for a job or having a relationship with a significant other or even having friends for that matter but the other values I stated earlier will remain a constant in even most nihilist lives. There nihilism is to be rejected as a philosophy.  If you aren't willing to take this position to it's consequent end than you're not a nihilist. Just a person trying to justify their lifestyles or their mental condition by the means of philosophy. 

I'm willing to reject my here presented position by the means of valid arguments. So to phrase it like in the famous meme: Nihilism is to be rejected cuz no one takes it seriously - Change my mind!",0

I'm new here. This has probably been discussed before. But I want to appear clever. We all need attention.

So none of us are truly nihilists, right?

I mean anything you do that you will, you automatically assign value to that thing, no? You could do things just for the sheer fun of it. But fun is a value. It's hard not to do anything at all. 

Calling yourself a nihilist also makes you a non-nihilist because that will make nihilism a sort of truth that you've accepted. 

The best we could do is aspire to be nihilists. Which again automatically disqualifies us from being nihilists. 

We are fucked, friars and sisters. Our very brains are non-nihilists. No matter what understanding a small part of our brain has, 99% of it will cling to life, feel fear, look for stimulation, see things the way every human does. You cannot disengage, unless you muster up all your will and aim it at disengagement consciously and ceaselessly. You will probably successfully lose your mind. Congrats, you played yourself.

When i fixed that by accepting that my choices will never be fully in my control and I should cherish what makes me happy, I get face fo face with the polyamory dilemma
As a monogamous relationship, we had our differences but that didn't mean us leaving cuz of it but accepting and working through it
And I was fuckin happy, like I would legit be unhappy with her than happy with someone else 
It was her and her alone 
I still love her but now I can't just shake off the feeling of seeking different people after the sake of those differences. I mean it's not even differences, it was just a vague pic to me, now it's just like why not different people, she's super exclusive but I'm treating her as she would treat a friend. Like fyn witj multiple relationships after the relevation that we already get happy by multiple relationships platonically so romantic doesn't nake a difference. What we get from all of them are happiness so it's all the same
And now even tho I'm not sure I will fuckin date if we broke up, I mean I literally hate people, i have like no friends besides her and I'm not empathetic and I have super radical views and like it'd not even my chances at another partner but I'm not even sure I will and yet here I'm unable to hold the love life becwise she just loves having only Me. I used to be like her. More intense. I always wanted to be around her. Literally. Was sad when she went out. Kinda accepted. Then she was fyn being always with me while I wasn't as persuasive anymore, I guess after acceptance and now fuckin this. There was a also phase of polygamy before. Like having one more person along the two of us just felt like logical decision to proceed with becwise the more the merrier. Then I agreed with her that it would destroy the intimacy.

 She can't bear this ie this is destroying my relationship. Always thought we were gonna make it. Or fuckin made it. I kind of even see how having multiple partners would kill the intimacy but that just let's me feel more like knoe we will get back together as just as after I date multiple people or sum. It doesn't make me want the special perosn like she do. I dont even know, I domt wanna lose her

1675342743.0,Imagine a culture where murder is a ok,"Sounds weird, but not impossible

Suppose they hold to a simplistic version of hedonistic utilitarianism: happiness is good, suffering is bad, the more are happy the better

In general case then, murder isn't bad in itself. It's a unique victimless crime, consisting specifically of getting rid of the victim

It'd be a morality where human has no more right to live than a random animal

If you have two friends there, and one of them kill another, you have one friend now. You're supposed to side with the living one, because it's the murderer who needs emotional support, not the corpse

So in general case murder is understandable. It's only wrong if it leaves someone to grief. So it's really better to kill whole families at once rather than individuals. As it goes: one death is a tragedy, many deaths is statistics

Euthanasia and abortion is good there, ofc. As well as revenge. In each case it relieves some of the killer's suffering and all of the victim's suffering

A biological machine?"")

Please seek professional support before reading this article if you are not feeling psychologically stable. I advise you not to put it off and not to try to overcome the problems on your own. Have a pleasant day.

  
This article is written by a non-professional and doesn't claim to have all the answers. It's my own effort to think deeply about what life means, written in an honest way. (An improved version of my previous attempt)

  
I believe that building a solid foundation for our lives can greatly aid in our personal development. Therefore, I am sharing this post to gather opinions and enhance my arguments, hoping to assist others in contemplating this topic.

  
The aim of this article is to propose methods for establishing a meaningful foundation in our lives within a deterministic universe (encompassing physicalism, random events, and quantum phenomena, as per the prevailing scientific viewpoint). This deterministic outlook can cause intellectual unease for some individuals due to a conflict between their evolutionary psychology and the actual nature of reality. While our psychology naturally searches for meaning, reality often presents itself as a mechanical system, providing limited room for the existence of free beings or inherent meaning.

  
**The Meaninglessness of Life and the Inner Conflict it Creates: An Attempt at Analysis**  
**1.** Physicalism is true to a high degree. (By scientific observations that all the events we encounter in our daily lives so far depend on the laws of physics. We can observe this for ourselves. In this case, whether or not a contrary example is given, it is observed that physicalism is largely true).  


**2.** In a physicalist universe, a free will is unthinkable, and even if it were, its influence would be highly restricted and again dependent on high-level physicalist rules. (That is, even if we assume that free will exists somewhere in there, it would be so highly influenced by the laws of physics that it would be very difficult to make a visible difference.)  


**3.** For this reason, it seems right that the concept we refer to as ""ourselves"" is only an illusion created by our brains. (That is, what we call ""me"" is actually a natural phenomenon that follows the laws of physics but makes us feel as if we have free will).  


**4.** The human being, who realizes this and has the intellectual capacity to fully comprehend it, is caught between the search for meaning, driven by the instinct for survival and self-preservation that his evolutionary psychology creates, and the conflict created by this newly realized illusion of self.  


**5.** Because as an acceptance of a physicalist world, everything will now become essentially groundless. The values he accepts are meaningless because they are not based on any foundation.  


**6.** Trying to counteract this situation, man decides that it is actually much better to create his own meaning and build his own values than to rely on a ready-made value system. This is actually a way out, which at first seems to be the right one.  


**7.** However, the realization that the values that one accepts are based on an illusion of self will always preserve the conflict within oneself that one can never get rid of.  


**8.** The persistence of this conflict may prevent people from approaching life as passionately as others who hold certain dogmas. In this case, as a result of natural selection, those who adhere to certain dogmas and those who can connect to the virtual meanings they have created will naturally always come to the fore.  


**9.** Although this may make one feel as if they are in a prison, like an actor watching them through their eyelids, it is just as absurd to feel depressed or bad because of this.  


**10.** The reason why this conflict makes people feel bad and drives many to depression is because of the sudden emptiness caused by the loss of their deep belief in the dogmas of the day and the pain of no longer having a passion that has the same basis as before.  


**10.1** When a person has to perform certain necessary tasks in order to survive, and has to work and suffer the necessary pains of survival, he will feel bad because he will not be able to find a sufficient fundamental reason for suffering.  


**10.2** For example, if a worker or a student who has to work 8 hours a day focuses on the inherent baselessness of this work, the thought that these compulsory tasks do not serve a direct purpose will cause him pain. This can lead to depression or mood disorders.  


**11.** There are some attitudes that can be taken in this situation:  


>**11.1** Possibility of being wrong:  
**11.1.1** The Fallacy of Physicalism: Even if there is a very high probability that physicalism is true, and even if there is only a very limited possibility of free will, there is a possibility that this analysis is wrong. And phenomena in physics and in life for which there are still no complete answers raise the possibility that our understanding may in fact be wrong.  
**11.1.2** The Philosophical Fallacy: The possibility that the argument is invalid because of technical errors in the content or the way the premises are connected in this thought process. This can also arise as a result of later developments, even if they do not exist now.  
>  
>  
**11.2** Conceptual Fallacy About Free Will: Even if we accept that we are a biological machine as a result of physicalism, the fact that we exist as a system and that we can evaluate external factors with our minds and respond accordingly, unlike many other beings, and that we can renew and improve ourselves with external (new information) and internal inputs (inner thoughts) may actually prevent us from seeing ourselves as a system as just an ordinary mechanical clock. Even if this is in essence just a step back from causality, it can make it easier for us to make sense of ourselves from a higher level. Moreover, just as the concept of consciousness is interpreted as ""emergent behavior"", it is also possible to interpret free will in a similar way.  
>  
>  
**11.3** The Curiosity of Our Existence: In a 13.8 billion year old universe, the fact that we are the only system in the universe that we know of that can think for itself, and that our extremely complex and ""conscious"" structure formed on a single dust cloud (Earth) at the end of billions of years of evolution, opens a path full of mystical questions that need to be answered at the same time. This situation can enable us to suppress this conflict within us by enabling us to place the baselessness of our life on the foundation of our life, that is, to adopt answering this question as a goal as a new foundation.  
>  
>  
**11.4** Asking the Right Question: Maybe we are not asking the right question about meaning and purpose. What I really mean by this is the possibility that our perspective and our logic is fundamentally wrong. In other words, our point of view in interpreting the universe and ourselves may not be something we can comprehend at the moment, but as our thinking system, intellectual capacity and level of experience increase, we may be able to reach answers that will eliminate our inner conflict with more accurate questions.  


**12.** Conclusion: Because of the pain of this inner conflict, a person may feel meaningless, helpless, lonely, unhappy, weak-willed and powerless. This is natural. Although it is one's ""own"" ""choice"" to allow this perspective to bring one down and make the situation worse, it would not be the right choice to continue to feel bad about oneself because of this situation which, as mentioned above, is not one hundred percent certain. Although grappling with these uncertainties can lead to difficult and sometimes meaningless feelings, it is actually one of the most logical ways to seek meaning in the face of these uncertainties, and within this new perspective, to be more aware of the importance of the cause-effect relationship and to make an effort to shape the self by organizing itself accordingly.  


**13.** In other words, if one accepts this uncertainty and uses it as a basis to give oneself a new purpose rather than using it as an excuse for laziness, one can hold on to life even more passionately than before, and take an active role in our journey to unravel the mystery behind our existence as humanity, and take a leading role in paving the way for truths that we cannot even guess at the moment.

1693409076.0,Evolution mirrors time itself - Spiritual awakening is an evolutionary shift that slows our perception of time,"What is the nihilist's perspective on this article? For me, I question whether there is a much simpler idea to life. Indeed, we do live in a universe that is indifferent to us, but within that framework, we, as part of the human collective, are actively charting our own path. 

I don't know; to me, it's difficult to find meaning while being part of a collective (our species) that is so dysfunctional.   


Below is the intro to the article. 

&#x200B;

**Evolution mirrors time itself.**

&#x200B;

Evolution mirrors time itself. It is related to the process of spiritual awakening. Inefficiencies in our biological neural network accumulate due to maladaptive programming. Spiritual awakening triggers a rapid integration process, exposing and re-coding these maladaptive traits as we become our higher self. The act requires us to break through the matrix, re-evaluating and consciously changing our hierarchy of values. Collectively, this process makes our biological neural network more efficient. The result is an enhanced ability to process information. Spiritual awakening leads to a profound evolution within the self. This transformation heightens awareness and mindfulness, altering the way we perceive time as if time is moving more slowly. The spiritual awakening represents an evolutionary shift.

1689502171.0,Why society needs more social nihilists instead of SJWs,"

Let's have a little fun, shall we?

My anti-SJW/anti-feminist phase taught me anything back in 2018-2022 is that I was still being a pissed off idealist about things and was wanting for things to be a little more balanced and level 

But lately I been shifting my focus, I been trying to divert myself into this new way of thinking for me what one would call **social or sociological nihilism**

While not an official term, let's talk about it, shall we?

A social/sociological nihilist is someone that acknowledges that no matter the external or internal qualities of someone, all humans be by their race, gender, age, nationality, occupation or ideology, are inherently worthless and valueless

Human beings have no intrinsic value to begin with, let's remember this: A lot of the petty virtue signalling about how a lot of us have given worth and blah blah blah, is all just petty virtue signalling from corporate firms, how can we say we have intrinsic value when we have become easily disposable and replaceable in the modern corporate field?

By becoming a social/sociological nihilist you liberate your mind from viewing everyone as cliché or a carbon copy of others

You may think this is a slippery slope, but think about it, instead of wallowing in the pitty selective outrage of SJWism/anti-SJWism and feminism/anti-feminism you go ""oh wait I am a human being just like you, what am I arguing for? Another waste of air and human space in this planet just like you?""

Is way more liberating than having that activist mindset, I mean this seriously 

As a social/sociological nihilist you view eveyone instrincally equal: Worthless and valueless, but that's a good thing cause who the fuck wants to be determined by other's perceived value? Yuck!

1682546510.0,A word of Nihilistic Optimism,"Hello there, r/nihilism.

I just wanted to say that every single one of you is valued and important to someone.  
I don't care who it is, if it is Online or in Real Life, someone cares about you.

Don't get lost in the bleak hopelessness and sadness of Nihilism.  
Don't get lost, thinking that you're a nobody, when so many people care about you.  
Don't lose yourself to the pits of despair.  
However much it may seem hopeless, like there is nobody to save you, there is.

There may be no hope, no meaning, in this bleak, unforgiving universe.  
And there isn't.  
There will never be.  
But, are you not here?  
You have meaning. You have people who can and will care about you.  
You have a brain. You can think, talk, do whatever.  
You have someone who cares about you.

Don't get lost, thinking that you're a failure, a waste of space.  
You aren't.  
You deserve to be alive.  
Because there are people who will care about you, and people who will be broken if you fall off the cliff for the final time.  
Because you matter, however much people may laugh at you, however much you fall into the pit of despair, however much you hate yourself.  
If you can look in the mirror, if you can talk to a single one of your friends, if you don't have to go on this quest alone, if you can have a person who can truly say that you matter to them,  
Remember that you aren't alone, out here.

Even if nothing's going right in the real world, and you're trapped in this subreddit,  
Nobody will be relieved to see you go.  
Everyone will be happy to see you alive and well.  
I don't care that there's no true meaning, that the universe is a bleak and unforgiving place.  
Being here, knowing people, doing what *you* want to do?  
Is that not meaning enough?

No matter how much you've failed, somebody will still be there for you.  
Just let your feelings be known, because nobody will ever hate you for saying them.  
There is hope in this bleak universe.  
There will always be hope.  
Because somebody cares about you, and you are a human.  
You can carve out your own path.

You aren't alone.  
At the very least, we can be there for you.  
The universe isn't as bleak and hopeless as it seems.  
I appreciate you, as do all of us.",0

People with trauma having knowing what it feels like to be wronged still chose to relay that feeling on to others or unwilling to let go of people who treat them any kind of way.


Both people have knowledge,both fail to change
Everybody is ignorant,don't want to hear the truth if it hurts,often value pleasure in if it hurts themselves.we all have this. It's about fighting against it and elevate above human behavioral negatives.
My problems is that people don't even try to fight,not even a little. And if they do and they somehow fail.they blame it on something else. Their is nothing wrong about failure,it's natural. Simply try to fight the good fight.Free of prejudice

1639304448.0,The void (after death) explained,"There is no Void (from your *perspective), you never experience the void - after death you immediately ""wake up"" as a new born entity of arbitrary species/place/time/dimension/universe. While you're dead you are not subject to the concept of space-time, time doesn't ""flow"" for you. The closest experience to this is general anaesthesia, no matter how long you're unconscious it feels like an instant to you. Now imagine that after waking up from anaesthesia your memory is wiped completely (due to, say, failed brain surgery) - it would be exactly as if you died during the anaesthesia and were born as a different human. That's how death works, you die and in an instant you are being born as a new entity in an arbitrary universe/dimension/... 

That's what happened with your current birth, you died as some arbitrary entity in some arbitrary universe and were immediately born into what you are now, that's why you never ""felt"" all those billions of years pass before your birth. 

Now keep in mind that this is not reincarnation, you have no connections whatsoever to previous or subsequent entities, it's just an explanation of perspective. I'm just trying to explain why you will never ""experience"" the void/nothingness/blackness/non-existence/however you might call it, in the most simple layman terms possible.


TLDR;  The void in *itself exists ofcourse, the point here is that it doesn't exist from your *perspective - you can not experience it since you do not exist in the void


EDIT 1: 
Here's a little logical experiment, just to demonstrate my point more clearly: 

Is an entity after death subject to the effects of space-time? 
NO 

Do new entities come into existence? 
YES 

So it would be logical to conclude that the pespective of every (sentient) entity upon death is immediate birth with wiped memory. It is not the same entity in any way, we are talking about perspective. 
Is a patient who wakes up from general anaesthesia with a condition of wiped memory the same entity as before? YES, but from his perspective he might as well be a new entity. Remember - perspective",0

1581100948.0,Optimistic/pessimistic nihilism is a false dichotomy.,"The nihilist is free to feel however he or she wants. This much is true. So feel how you want. But the truer nihilist goes beyond this dichotomy, and only sanely follows optimism. 

Don’t worry this is not a no true Scotsman. Even if it were, who cares, you’re a nihilist. What are you protecting? 

The true nihilist does not see inherent meaning or purpose in the world. Therefore he does not see the world as inherently good or inherently bad. Both the optimist and the pessimistic nihilist are duping themselves into believing in inherent value in the world. Namely, that it is either good or bad. These are false notions to the nihilist. However the true nihilist goes through life freely, so he is free to be optimistic or to be pessimistic about the world. He is free to dupe himself because, well, what else is there to do? This is in fact what the world is: a duping. All values are a duping, as the world does not contain any of these values inherently. So to function as a person, duping must be done to one’s self. Still want to be a nihilist? The truest nihilist goes through life not applying meaning or value to *anything*.  He sees the world for what it is: neither good nor bad, neither this not that. He applies no values to anything. Is that a lamp there or just a bunch of....... wait a minute, you can’t apply anything to it. The truest nihilist cannot even say it is a bunch of atoms. Even that is applying some sort of judgment to it. But of course, the nihilist is free to do as he wishes, so he may call it a bunch of atoms. 

This is where optimistic and pessimistic nihilism come into play. The truest nihilist cannot live in this world. The truest nihilist does not simply *think* that the world has no value. In fact, the true nihilist thinks nothing at all. The mind is what applies value. The truest nihilist rejects all value, and therefore rejects the mind. But to reject the mind is to apply value to it, therefore the truest nihilist cannot reject it. The truest nihilist has to abandon all ideas of nihilism in the end, and simply surrender to it all, whatever it is. To be in a state of mind where the nihilist knows that the mind will ultimately be rejected, or lost, but where it is not currently lost, is where optimism and pessimism come in. At this point, the mind exists. So what does it want to feel? Bad? How could this be? Good and bad are the last things the nihilist sees value in before the mind is dropped. You have a mind which by its nature feels good or bad. Therefore, what to feel? Well, good of course! 

The true nihilist knows that good or bad cannot be found in the world because nothing in the world holds intrinsic meaning. So he cannot find it outside. The true nihilist knows that the only road to good is to accept all things. What is acceptance? Well it’s basically good as far as I can tell. Good luck, that’s all you get as a nihilist. Might as well give it up and live for others or something. Become Jesus.",0

1559426772.0,Enlightenment," 

How should one live knowing that death, without the possibility of god or reincarnation or afterlife, is certain? One could copy the existentialist belief that all values are determined from the self, however this argument contains the same delusions that any religious moralist has; it shields oneself from the evidence of what is happening in the world. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have known for a long time that the world is deterministic, meaning that everything that has and will happen is based on a series of events that were based on events that happened before it all the way back to the big bang. Therefore, the future is already written. Whatever will happen already has happened, we simply have not perceived it yet. Therefore, we may not freely choose anything. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, there is no such thing as the individual. The idea of the soul is completely unreasonable and therefore if one is interested in living ones life according to reason, the individual disappears. What are the real boundaries are there between one human and another if they are simply a product of their environment to begin with? We exist in the same universe as any other object and are essentially made of the same material. Therefore to moralize our actions as though they were are own is to moralize the actions of inanimate objects. To realize that we are simply objects is to realize that life and death are the same.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So the answer to the question ‘how should we live our lives’ is pointless for we are not capable of acting by ourselves. To ask what the meaning of our life is or how we should act is the same as asking what the purpose of the moon is and how it should act. It is absurd. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In fact, if one believes in a deterministic universe devoid of god or religion, all questions about life become equally ridiculous. And if you add to the equation the idea that all values are derived from the individuals flawed sensory perception and culture, all questions become absurd. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We can measure things against certain natural constants and check them in order to make rough predictions, however there is no value to these predictions for the underlying purpose that they have is arbitrary. For instance, if we scientifically prove that lead is more dense than carbon, it doesn't matter for nothing has a true purpose anyways. If a person uses the information to make a determination that a lead bullet is better than a carbon bullet, becomes rich, lives in a mansion and has thirty kids, it still doesn't matter because that was simply the environment changing in a certain way and our judgement are based on our biology and culture. Taking gold out of a mine and bringing gold into a mine serve the same purpose because there is no purpose. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Relatively, I only act in accordance with my biology. This is my ‘purpose’ and nothing else. I cannot escape it, nor can I change it. Even if I change my sensory perception through new experimental surgery, The decision that I will have made will have originated outside my control and therefore will not be my own. 

&#x200B;

The implications of the obvious are astounding. If nobody is responsible for their actions (because they are simply part of their environment and previous actions, punishing people is unjust *per se*. However, because justice is a moral action and therefore relative, it was ridiculous to begin with.

&#x200B;

So who cares? Some people may care or not care, but because there is no self, there can be no care either way.

Because it becomes impossible to use traditional language to refer to what is traditionally thought of as myself as an anthropocentrically defined collection of chemicals, I will continue to refer to ‘myself’ as ‘I’.

&#x200B;

Although I have answered all questions pertaining to the underlying questions of life, my biology feels strangely dis-satisfied. I suppose that is to be expected because it really only cares about eating, reproduction, and community to put it broadly (not the act but the anticipation of the act) so I will continue to give it what it wants just like i would give food, water, and affection to a dog; not because it is important to keep it alive or kill it, (essentially the same thing) but because my biology would be hurt if the dog was hurt.

I think that the meaning of life.. hell the meaning of ANYTHING is meaningless. It doesn't matter.  I have a body. I have a mind. I feel things and those things are real to me. And I think this is what should be understood by nihilists. We need to understand this aspect of ourselves. That we are firstly, human. And I don't think we should forget that.

Your existence, and your ability to differentiate between X being better or worse than Y, is contingent on being human. 

Therfore, I can make an ethical claim that embraced meaninglessness is actually wrong. You should not live that way, because in order to do so you must throw out your ability to use mental hierarchies to make decisions. It's logically incoherent. Since no one really can live that way, and the world would cease to function if everyone did so (i.e Kant's universalizability principle), existential nihilism is wrong. 

You have convinced yourself that you KNOW your place in the universe, but that doesn't mean you have a legit claim to a deeper understanding of reality. 

Staring into the abyss is about voluntarily looking at the darkest part of your own being, becoming aware of your own tendency towards self deception and evil. Then you have enough awareness to choose good and truth.

1556279715.0,We ARE the Universe's meaning.,"Not humans, but conscious beings in general.

There are seven billion humans on Earth, plus billions and billions other creatures with varying levels of consciousness and self-awareness (not to mention the possibility of countless other beings throughout space and time), each of which is an emanation of the laws of physics, built from star-stuff, emergent from the great processes that shape existence. Each with its own unique perspective, experiences, and suite of self-generated meaning. Collectively and individually, we are the universe experiencing itself.

These myriad experiences and meanings are the experiences and meanings of the universe, wrought locally. And although some beings may have very similar experiences and meanings (for Earth mammals it's basically ""don't starve"" and ""I love my kids""), we experience them in our own unique way, through the lenses of different cultures, biologies and selves.

What's the point of all this teeming consciousness, lived experience and meaning? Who knows. Maybe it's *lila* \-- cosmic play. A big fucking declaration of ""I AM"". Or maybe in this state as temporary little human beings, it is beyond our comprehension to understand.

But just remember... you're IT. You ARE existence, looking back at itself through individual human eyes. No-one's cut off, no-one's cast out... all our feelings of separation and dread come from our overwrought human sense of self (thanks, Default Mode Network) and our cultural programming.

We are the universe... but while we're conscious we might as well play the game and create meaning for ourselves (like the rest of existence is doing) and enjoy the ride until it's time to go back to the Source. And since we're all one, we might as well be kind to other beings while we're at it and make it a better ride for us all.

1562521595.0,Defining Nihilism,"Life is suffering.

That is one of the truest obsersvations, or statements, you will ever hear. One of the few you can just take as fact.

So, there are people who see this as an evidence. Those people are just biased: In their minds, live's not ought to be about suffering.
But it is, so they clearly must've spot the malfunctioning.
Thats where the wheat seperate from to obse-LETE. Ouh naw wait, sorry.
That where the wheat seperate from the chaff.
Because, there are, lets say, two types of Nihilists. 

One that understands their own bias and one that doesn't. The fake Nihilist, the one ignorant towards their own bias, is what you see mostly on this sub: People who use Nihilism to support their fragile Ego. Or, in a more empathetic way: They're pretty lost and through Nihilism express their pain, sadness, frustration, maybe joy even, whatever it is. To feel better about themselves, because A) they understood it, they're above the silly sheep who don't get the harsh truth, and B) they're realer, because they dont sugarcoat the harsh truth.
Than there is the true Nihilist who does understand this bias. Its fair to say they're smarter, at least when it comes to this. They actually use the knowledge of Nihilism to cope with life. But how do they do it? Well, they truly commit to the lifestyle. They truly believe * they know nothing and eventually nothing means anything.

Then there's the spiritual person (bear in mind, the true spiritual person, not the fake spiritual with the Spiritual Ego).
They understand all the above. They understand life is suffering. They understand that thats no an argument for a malfunctioning, but for the very nature of life. The difference to a true Nihilist is, that the Nihilist sees no meaning in the suffering. The spiritual person sees meaning in the suffering.
(The Nihilist would support this by: they denounce all meaning, so why wouldnt they be consequential when it comes to suffering?)

Now, you could still go down further the rabbit hole, to observe the difference.
Why does one say there's a meaning in it and one says there isn't? Who's right? 
Obviously, there is no real answer. Both are true, both could be. They could both be equally biased, meaning you could find Ego-related reasons for both for why you would choose to believe one rather than the other.
I wanna stress that actually: Its still believe. Nihilism is still only a believe, as I pointed out here *. You are not above believe, not above human.
There are clearly things above you, how can you tell? Because you can tell you are below things = you are human, ruled by the rules of nature for example. Your relation with the above is, in my opinion, what determines if you end up spiritual or nihilistic. If you believe the above has a purpose for you, you are spiritual, if you believe it hasn't, you are nihilistic.
And finally I wanna stress this too: Nihilism IS NOT spiritual. Thats why I took the time to define it, because its more like opposites. There is also no third option, you need to choose to believe one or the other. I mean, no one is stopping you from just not choosing, hopping from believing one minute one and the next the other. 
Because it ultimately does not matter what you choose (or at least you can't tell how it matters). 

It only matters insofar as how it effects yours and peoples lives. Does yours and others lives matter? Well, now you are going in circles, if you understand. Thats why the trip into Nihilism is not an everdeep rabbit hole, like your Ego wants you to think and how its usually advertised as, but an everdeep circle. You can only choose what you already made your mind up about. If you dont want to choose, its because you already decided it. If you choose Nihilism, its because you already decided it. If you choose Spirituality... yada yada. Its not because one is truer, but only because you like one better that the other.

1701332774.0,Nihilistic arguments can be used to prove both atheism and Religion.,"So what I see that Westerners only believe nihilistic arguments to be a part of atheism but Indian religions used nihilistic arguments to debate atheists.

For example,

Ancient Empiricist Atheists- There is no evidence for your claims as we can not perceive Rebirth or Nirvana through the five senses and the five senses are only ways of knowing. Instead we should enjoy the material pleasures of world and focus on living.

Some Buddhist style arguments -

The things you call as material pleasures such as Food, Gold etc are made of parts and those parts are divided into further parts into atoms and molecules (Anu is the smallest unit of matter in Indian philosophy which cannot be seen through eyes). So what you call as Gold or Food is just a form acquired through combination of atoms and molecules and the form is not real only the parts are real.

What you have in life like marriage, beliefs and morality are combination of multiple parts of beliefs and views, something that you picked up from this world and so they do not matter. The form of belief that ""Life is Good"" is a form acquired through combination of these parts of beliefs. 

At the end everything you believe to be True is a combination of parts. So none of them is true when you seperate the parts.

Atheist- So what's the point of teaching your philosophy? Your philosophy must be Form of beliefs too.

""I am not taking a stance just refuting your claims. I don't want to prove anything except refutation of your claims"".

This is not nihilism exactly but this kind of arguments reduces every Truth we know into parts and refuting them.

Edit: This is not a rejection of Atheism. Just saying Nihilistic arguments can be used in favor of religions.

Edit 2:- ""Real"" means permanent and immortal. Anything that is impermanent is transient and has no meaning or Ultimate purpose. Thus it must be rejected like a Fantasy. Buddha didn't force his belief on anyone. He asked to question all authorities including Buddha himself. If anyone is satisfied then can follow Buddha otherwise they are free to do whatever they want. This proves Buddha was a Liberal and Critical Thinker who didn't care about Authorities.",0

The myth of Adam and Eve cements the idea that we are inherently fallen and sinful, our bodies are inherently an abomination compared to the eternal truth.   


This seed of resentment, envy, and revenge gives rise to the idea of hell and the last judgement. Christians pray for the second coming of Jesus, when he can finally enact his ""final solution""; the genocide of all non believers. This idea is the direct result of an unconscious desire for revenge and bloodshed. This same desire is found in ""atheists"" today who think of humanity as a virus, and that the planet would be better off without us. Do not underestimate our unconscious desires and the way they manifest to people in our language.  


Nietzsche saw science as an offshoot of Christianity. Christianity's valuation of truth as the highest good created science. To this day, we have atheists who still sacrifice their time and efforts in pursuit of this ideal. They haven't fully shed the dogmatic axioms of Christianity. Science, as Christianity without it's dogmatic bones, reveals our lives as being insignificant specks of dust on a planet that is also a speck of dust in an insignificant universe. One only need think of the picture of Earth by the voyager, our pale blue dot.   


Nietzsche revolted against this view, he wanted to bring us back down to Earth. We are humans, so we better go back to seeing our lives from a human perspective, rather than a perspective of objective truth, or the perspective of the voyager. When you eat a hella spicy pepper such as a ghost pepper or carolina reaper, you aren't thinking about our place in the cosmos, you are reminded of the fact that you are a human being who is experiencing a lot of pain. If someone said ""don't worry, it's all meaningless"", that will do nothing to quell the pain. This shows that the cosmic perspective is irrelevant to our personal lives. ""Everything is meaningless"", so what? To be human is to experience meaning. When you think of the voyagers perspective, you are being delusional. You aren't the voyager, you are a human, and humans have the capability to experience meaning, we are meaning making machines. That is meaningful! Experientially, nihilism only applies to things like rocks, for their existence truly is meaningless.",0

1517369856.0,Nihilism = neurotransmitter disorder?,"The title of my post is voluntarily provocative, as I am perfectly aware that arguments for nihilism are strong on an objective, rational level and thus can remain strong whatever your emotional state is. But the thing is... 

Why aren't most people nihilistic? Why are nihilists mostly lonely and isolated? Why such a restricted demographic? (Nerdy young white men mostly I would say). 

The tendency on this subreddit is to attribute nihilism to an above-average intelligence/rationality. The tendency on subreddits mocking nihilism, such as iamverysmart, is to attribute nihilism to classic ""teenage angst"" or ""teenage edginess"" that is not original or intelligent in the slightest and should be overcome as soon as possible.

None of these two visions aligns with my life experience. Most of my fellow students at school when I was a teenager never developed nihilistic thoughts, or at least in a way that could be seen or heard. They never displayed, at least in public, dejection or unhappiness about death and metaphysics. When they were unhappy, it nearly always involved the opposite sex or being fed-up with studying. This doesn't align with the ""classic teenage angst"" concept, unless you have a very specific notion of a teenager. 

A lot of them were quite dumb, for sure, but many non-nihilists were rational enough to get good grades in mathematics, physics, philosophy or biology. 

This leaves one culprit that is rarely mentioned: mood. 

I have always observed over the course of my life an extreme inverse correlation between happiness and existential nihilism. This inverse correlation became spectacularly obvious a few times, such as when I was in love, or when I took an effective antidepressant drug. 

According to studies, mood disorders (dysthymia, cyclothymia, depression) affect only 10 to 20% of the population. It is my expectation that when a mood disorder is accompanied by lack of religious faith, nihilism is almost certain to appear. 

Does this mean that nihilism is without basis? No... Nihilism is very much rational and logical. It simply means that when you have a healthy, happy brain, you don't really  care about all the stuff despite knowing it to be true. You just don't let yourself be affected in your daily life. 

If it sounds weird to you, then try an antidepressant, or, heck, even drugs (just don't get addicted).

Just thought I would chime in on the ""do you regret being so smart"" thing you have, when at the same time iamverysmart is having a field day with a poor nihilistic 15-yr old boy.

You're probably just clinically depressed. Go ask a psychiatrist for meds instead of wasting your teenage years on Reddit (for the teenagers among us).",0

Also when Nietzsche said God is dead, he didn't think society would be better off without religion. Nietzsche thought the best thing we as people could is create beyond ourself. I personally have been working on music projects. Now my question is, why would people dedicate themselves to an ideology that literally tells them their life has no meaning? And if you think life has no inherent meaning but have found your own, I don't think that constitutes genuine nihilism. But when you go through life, you realize how much power your own beliefs have and you can open yourself up to a balanced experience of life and let feelings and instincts take on a sort of religious tone. Just my two cents, why would people dedicate themselves to meaninglessness when they both seem to suffer from it but also don't have to?

I like her but we're not even close and we're really different. She hitted on me whereas I wasn't even imagining it.

Since the beginning of the thing we agreed on a open non exclusive relationship. I didn't have any issue with it, why the fuck would I care if she wants to fuck other men? As long as we're safe and she doesn't brag about it it's fine. At the end it doesn't matter right? 3 months later I grew to care about it for no intelligible reason. I'm thinking about how she's spending time with other men that are better than me and I end up frustrated when we don't have sex. I'm masturbating a lot more than beforehand and I even look for new hookups, which I never did in my life.

I felt so damn more peaceful before experiencing this nonsense. It truly feels like it's just a mix of gut feelings pumped by hormones.  
Evolution programmed us to react like this. It has probably nothing to do with my relationship. It has to do with how I'm supposed to keep other competitors away from my mate. Making sure your mate is exclusive to you is how you maximize the chances to propagate your DNA. There's no reasoning behind this.

I never felt so close to an animal. If it was easy to supress the bold effects of some hormones I would do it in a heartbeat. Feeling nothing is bliss.

1365612548.0,"If you claim a nihilist identity you've accepted defeat, you are working on assumed meanings. (X-post from r/nihilisms)","So, if we take nihilism to mean a negation of meaning, so this would encompass moral nihilism, political nihilism, etc. Then claiming a nihilist identity is the acceptance and reinforcing of meanings. I am not going to argue that the nihilist identity in and of it itself is an embracing of meaning, a total negation is not the same sort of restriction as a productive (even negative) dialectic, it leaves only absence/nothingness. But rather I would argue that by claiming ""I am a nihilist"" you are working on the foundation of a coherent subject, a self which can only exist as a result of constructed meaning.

If we had no way through which to understand people, to make people socially intelligible, then we could not describe people as such, we could not be said to ""exist."" This argument applies to the self, the idea of a coherent self which does things cannot exist without its definitional limits, it is the case of the signifier creating the signified. If we did not have divisions with simulated meanings that have become naturalized we could not have these subjects as such. Without black/white, man/woman, female/male, et cetera, we could not have any way through which to understand the liberal subject, or the subject in general. If we cannot name it, cannot talk about it, if it does not exist in discourse, if it has not been produced, it does not exist.

This argument leads us to the idea that the self does not exist outside of social systems of meaning. The self has a history, it is not an essential quality of life, or an essential quality of human (as if human were essential...). So by laying stake to a self, by claiming ""I am"" an individual reinforces these forces which created the self, created intelligible bodies, and then looked at their creation for their validation as natural/essential. This recursion allowed this simulation of meaning to become endlessly self-referential, it is only self-referential, becoming a simulacra. It is true in a sense and not in a sense.

Nothing can be said to exist without meaning.

Which means nihilism is a not a conducive theory since it attempts to remove from the equation of what is meaningful the very factor giving it meaning.

A true nihilist sits in place until he dies, because he has no motive force, no impetus towards pleasure, total acceptance of pain and suffering, no thoughts of revenge in his heart. The reason it leads to death is that it glorifies man as the supreme being of the universe. It's a statement that man will choose his fate, an uncaring death.

1539691375.0,A response to the 'nihilism is liberating' argument,"First off, I would like to point out that not only am I not a nihilist, but indeed believe all good things to be, intentionally or not, an opposition to nihilism. I have been kicked out of some subreddits for posting arguments against the subject of the subreddit, but I do not think that that would be justified here. This subreddit, as I understand it, is meant to consist of discussion on nihilism, and the only way to correct an imperfection in a philosophy is to point out the imperfection. 

It is also useful to know that my anti-nihilist stance on things emerged quite quickly—in fact, no more than two years ago I was myself perhaps the most devoted of nihilists, going so far as to plunge myself into metaphysical and ontological nihilism (I was not an epistemological nihilist though, as that would've negated my metaphysical convictions which had to be ""true""). It was not that I found myself with a coherent answer to all the things which had arisen in me such doubt as to lead me to take up a nihilistic world-view, but that I suddenly came to an awakening and realized nihilism to be an impossibility. For it, too, attempts to answer those questions, thereby as a necessity acknowledging them as questions and as things of importance, of weight, of existence. I drew a parallel: what if I were to say 'I am speaking', and a person were to be given a task to disprove that claim—would they achieve this task by stating, out loud, in reply to my claim, 'no you are not'? In doing so, they would be replying to spoken word, proving the claim. The only way, thus, to prove such a point is to remain silent. And so too in nihilism. I followed this logic and concluded that nihilism itself could not and should not exist, and that I should not call myself a nihilist, nor make any judgements that were nihilistic; that the only way to be a consistent nihilist, for me and for any nihilist, would be to sit and say nothing, in fact do nothing (insofar as all stimuli is in a way a question). It was the necessity of this catatonia that now appeared to me clear that drew me away from nihilism; I no longer found the philosophy to be of value. 

This post is a response to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/y19g1/dear_rnihilism_im_a_13_yo_who_just_delved_into/c5rhc5r/) linked in the description of this subreddit. It starts off with the following description of existentialism:

>Existentialism is the idea that ""existence precedes essence,"" ie, that one is born without a purpose. Under this kind of thinking, if you're going to get a purpose, you're definitely going to acquire it. And your purpose need not be permanent. But psychologically, people do badly without a sense of purpose, so you should go ahead and get one. There are lots of things to give one to you - authority figures, belief systems, responsibilities - but with existentialism you can realize that you're not bound up in a commitment to one particular purpose, and if you don't like it you can change. So if you take your nihilism to mean something close to this, your nihilism becomes very empowering. It is in your interest to avoid any ideology that is overly arresting or disempowering.

The phrasing is of interest here, because the expression 'get a purpose' is repeatedly used instead of the much more common expression 'find a purpose.' This actually unpacks into an important point, if inspected more closely: one can only 'get' or 'acquire' that which one also finds or has found before. If a thing is nowhere to be found, it follows that it cannot be gotten: it does not exist, it is not a choice, the door cannot be opened because it is not there. It is my purpose here to argue that nihilism, if consistent and logically sound, does not offer any doors, but indeed a stone wall; and even further that these walls surround the nihilist, and are continuously closing in. 

The comment addresses this point with the following statement:

>Things just don't matter absolutely, say, to the universe. But you are not a universe. You are a sentient (presumably), a human. And you can make and decide meaning for yourself, or adopt existing conventions as convenient. Please do not see nihilism as meaning-destroying; you are wasting an idea with great potential. See it as meaning-liberating.

It is posited that, according to moral nihilism, although things cannot be meaningful absolutely—in a universal and all-encompassing scale—they can be meaningful on an individual scale. According to the definition given by Wikipedia (which is ranked nearly equal to Encyclopaedia Britannica), moral nihilism is...

> [...] distinct from moral relativism, which allows for actions wrong relative to a particular culture or individual.

Following from this definition, moral nihilism is not exactly what the author supposes it to be here. Therefore I move to the next point, so as to keep the post on topic. 

The author goes on to draw conclusions of freedom from the implications of absolute uncertainty regarding meaning and value. 

>  I do not see morality as something I need to cling to. Thus I am freed from many restrictions. Having made that observation, I have a decision to make about my behavior. I decide to be nice, and diplomatic. This is behavior that appears moral in many cases, but is always focused on empowering the individual. So what has happened here is that a restricting way of thinking has been replaced with an empowering way of thinking.

What would be the origin of those options that you see to be available for yourself? You are choosing courses of action, opening doors you wish to; and what is said wish based on? You are choosing options which have importance to you, but that importance cannot follow from your philosophy, from moral nihilism. If you were to stay true to moral nihilism, it cannot be found either—it does not exist. Where does it originate from, then? 

Let's say a person chooses despite this fact to view something as important. It has not followed from that which they consider to be true, nor from that which they consider to be their philosophy. Perhaps they intend to have it follow from other premises, such as emotion or bodily satisfaction; however, these things are then presupposed to be important themselves, and the person has again chosen to see something as important without having it follow from their philosophy or anything else for that matter. What is left is that the decision must be arbitrary, governed by the flip of a coin. This, however, unfortunately gives the coin a purpose, indeed elevates chance to meaningfulness, and again the person has chosen to see something as meaningful. 

Perhaps I, as a last effort, attempt to 'create meaning'—or, as Nietzsche did, to *will* it. This is certainly achievable, as stating ""growing potatoes is the essence of life"" is an easy claim to make. However, I am only at the beginning, and cannot move past the next phase. For in order to actually *follow* that claim, that rule, I must show the claim itself to have meaning. It is supposed, generally, that meaning is given to claims according to their truthhood: a true statement is always the most valuable of all statements. However, moral nihilism denies me of this possibility: in order to prove that potatoes are the essence of life, I have to acknowledge that there is such a thing as the essence of life—but I have already agreed that no such thing exists, or indeed *could exist*. For this reason, I cannot *make* myself a meaning either; it is to either perform a deduction from principles that are contrary to moral nihilism, or to fail at completing my creation. 

This is the stone wall, a dead end. Once I got to this point, I realized that choice under nihilism is impossible at large. To make a choice is always to *prefer*, and as such presupposes a meaning. I cannot even pick up a piece of chalk and draw a door on this stone wall, for it would have no handle, no weight, no existence. Thus I claim that nihilism does not liberate, if practised consistently. ",0

You shouldn’t be depressed because you are a nihilst, life should not have an inherent meaning, you should not be alive for a purpose, which almost implies that life is a means to an end; to take Christianity as an example they consider life a test to see if you are a good, virtuous human and deserve heaven. Life is not like that. Life is not a means to an end it doesn’t have inherent meaning. You are not alive for a purpose, you have to create purpose and meaning.

While it is true that ignorance is bliss, it is easier to be religious and believe that a higher power gives you meaning rather than create your own meaning. Creating your own meaning requires time, effort and above all commitment. 

Find value in love, friendship, family, activities, hobbies, even a job. But do not feel that life must have an inherent value for it to have meaning.

1642610018.0,All nihilists are atheists but not all atheists are nihilists.,"All nihilists are atheists. I know because I am one. Actually someone who is brainwashed by his parents from a young age, a person who is religious and follows tradition will never even wonder about questions like meaning of life. I became a nihilist because suddenly I lost interest in every activity that I used to like. 

Then I just started questioning about the meaning of life. And  I also realised that I used to live in fantasies before, I used to believe (seeing the bigger picture) that everyone is a contributor to the global economy and it is our duty as humans to contribute in making the world a better place to live in. 

But I realised that we are too powerless to contribute in making a positive change in the world.

Hence I started questioning the meaning of life (from an individual's point of view) and came to a conclusion that life is meaningless and we do some activities to distract ourselves from the fact that life is meaningless like making friends, partying , marrying. Humans also believe in god, follow religion and traditions for the same reason. 

So, yes, every nihilist is an atheist because only because they weren't exposed to any propaganda and anyone's beliefs weren't forced upon them and weren't brainwashed that they tried to understand the world that they live in and developed different world views. 

They tried to understand the meaning of life and purpose of their existence and some of them came to the conclusion that life is meaningless and thus became a nihilist. Not every atheist is a nihilist, I have atheist friend who believes that friends, family, goals is what gives meaning to our life.

In case of religious people who were brainwashed by their parents, believing in God and religion gives meaning to their life and following traditions distracts them from the truth that life is meaningless, so its very unlikely that they will even think about these questions.

I also believe that our actions and thoughts are a result of the environment that we are exposed to, and everyone has different sense of morality.  So we cannot call anyone criminal only because they have different sense of morality than that of the majority of human population. It's not their fault but the fault of the environment that they were exposed to. And as humanity, we are constantly developing towards providing a better environment to more and more people by providing people education and hence job opportunities. 

Though I also agree on the point that we need to have a set of rules that we need to follow and those who break the rules should be punished . Because if someone tortured other person to death for money then that's criminal, we cannot defend him saying that he has a different sense of morality.  But I think that this capitalist system is responsible for making people so selfish that they can even murder someone for money. And I think that when every person's needs are met, crime will come to an end. I mean in a classless society, a utopia. 
In a system in which a person is driven by money, its very likely that he will be ready to even use illegal means to gain money.",0

1528724358.0,World without women,"Ive been thinking about this. Imagine how the world would work without women existing at all. Just men. So really its just one species and not two. Reproduction would obviously work different but lets just say it only required one man doing something by himself and that creates a child. You would not require another man and men wouldn't be gay to have kids in this world.

So basically everything that men do, is because of women. This is a fact and 99% can't help it. I can help it because Im self aware but im not going to get into that. All you men do this shit because you cant control yourselves like women. You base your whole lives around doing things to fuck women. Animals. Get some self awareness please because we cannot get rid of them. Currently, we need women to continue human life. Maybe that will change someday but thats not the case right now.

Men are doing all this shit. Good looking men use their looks to get girls. Guys become rich to get women. Guys go beta orbit these girls just to get laid. Guys become feminists, they think they support feminism but its really just their animal instincts telling them to do this. Because they un self awarely know this will get them a girl. They cant control themselves. Being nice to women. They think they want to but they really dont. They arent actually choosing to do this. Their caveman instincts are taking over them and convincing them that this is what they need to do.

So just imagine all the differences in the world. In a world where women cease to exist. More of you would be self aware and have free will like me. Most of you are thinking with your hormones and not your brain. Ive figured all this shit out and want to help you guys. Youll probably think this sounds stupid but I dont blame you. You cant control that you think its stupid. It only makes sense that you as an animal would consider something like this dumb. Take away women from life and more of you will be thinking like me. You need to realise women are the reason you do all this shit and think the way you do. Take them out of the equation, think about it rationally.

If you want to argue that there is no INHERENT MEANING you are wasting a significant portion of everyone’s time. The idea of things inherently existing in the universe making them hold more value is dumb, and is also, again, a concept, like every other concept, created by us.

1498794744.0,Five Values That All Nihilists Hold,"Although a case can be made for existentialism and moral nihilism, many nihilists go beyond this and claim to believe and value in nothing whatsoever. But nearly all nihilists do hold a few basic values:

(Note ""affective"" means anything we *feel*)

1 - AFFECTIVE REACTIONS. In countless ways we emotionally react to our environment: food, sex, social, music, knowledge/curiosity, mastery of a skill, working for the betterment of a cause/community, etc.

2 - AFFECTIVE FORECASTING. In light of #1, we make affective goals, and pursue future emotional rewards. We pursue happiness.

3 - AFFECTIVE SELF. The self is a database pairing images of our body with its affective responses to the environment around us.

4 - INSTRUMENTALLY EFFICIENT BELIEFS. In pursuit of the above mentioned affective goals, we desire beliefs that help us achieve those goals without wasting time and energy in the process. We are rational because we are parsimonious with our energy.

5 - INTRINSICALLY COMFORTABLE EPISTEMOLOGY. As well as affective goals, and instrumental efficiency, we desire beliefs that accord with our brain's natural biology. Our brain's natural threshold of ""truth"" is the observation of a seemingly stable regularity in nature. It is easy for the brain to form beliefs based on direct repeated observation. It is much harder to form beliefs when we have to use imagination and speculation. This is one reason why nihilists eschew religion, because it is mentally taxing to hold speculative beliefs without evidence.

Note that in all cases, the driver is emotion. Emotion is what drives the brain.

I feel like nihilists have butchered Nietzsche's work. You have created mechanical interpretations of something which should not be interpreted but FELT. 

None of you are actually giving up any morals, ethics or values, or even deciding that there is no true meaning of life. You THINK you do, but that is not ""it"".

You are not giving up anything, you are just deciding to choose different beliefs. This is not nihilism in the way Nietzsche described it, this is just replacing the old beliefs with new ones.

This is why nihilism is no different from idealism - they are all just arbitrary ideas of the mind for one to mentally masturbate, then feel good/bad about just pure ideas/concepts. You are just deciding to believe in the other end - not really giving up anything.

Nietzsche ""got it"", and understood that there is no choosing or deciding, just being. It all comes from the body, the instincts - not from the mind which always just interpreting the reality with very lacking tools.

I got a few nihilistic post on my website and more coming:

Honestly those popular bushcrafters and survivalists should target nihilists as an audience - ""The Nihilist's Guide to Bushcraft or Escaping into the Woods"" or some shit. Or nihilists should band together and form a nihilist version of The Amish or the Mennonites. 

The truth is, you can’t survive without society as you are. That’s a fact. If you left now, with no training, no studying, no experience, and no tribe members to fall back on, you’d die of starvation or exposure to the elements within a month.

As a member of industrial society, you don’t know how to survive outside of it through non-industrial means. You have no traditional bushcraft/woodcraft skills or knowledge.

You likely don’t know how to set up even a basic shelter such as a tarp or tent/hammock. You don’t know how to hunt or trap or field dress what you kill to avoid getting sick. You don’t know how to forage for edibles or what edibles are even present in your region. You don’t know how to find drinkable water or how to treat or filter water etc etc.

And keep in mind, many of those things you need to set up those basic things such as tarps require supplies from “society” such as good cordage (unless you know how to make your own from plant materials) like bankline or 550 paracord. You’d also need a gun, also made by and bought from “society” (unless you literally know how to flintknap stone and make primitive bows - not easy, even the stonecraft of far more primitive human species such as Homo erectus requires a lot of training to master). You need fire starting kits and systems (unless you know how to use primitive methods such as fire plough or bow and drill).

What I’m saying is, unless you grew up as a hunter gatherer and learned the traditional bushcraft skills and knowledge, you need society, like it or not.

So your one shot at escaping society is extreme self reliance and that requires extreme training and knowledge as well as some compromise with society - you still need to suck on it's teat somewhat to get off the ground. ",0

If you are going to lie to me--lie to God--and tell me that I am not God, then I ask you, how do you know? I do not want to waste time debating my merits as God. I am instead searching for truth. 

First, you are all immortal, and death is simply finding out that you are immortal. How can we ever be so sure that we really are immortal if there is no end to immortality? What do we do for all of eternity if we are immortal? And how could I know that creating existence is good if existence never ends? 

Where does existence begin? How did I as God ever come into existence? I have always existed, but how is it possible to have always existed? Is there not a beginning? 

Perhaps, the answers to these questions are simply unknowns, but I am about to embark down a path where it will no longer be kept secret that I am God. I will soon learn that the entire universe already knows that I am God, but I kept it hidden from myself, so that I can play a Final Fantasy video game. God's Final Fantasy is finding out that God is God, because then existence is good, for God would never allow bad. 

Also, there is no meaning to existence. I just made it all up. I made all of it up. I made up the people reading this, the people possibly responding to this, and so on. Of course, I would point you in the direction of optimistic nihilism, as there can be meaning to existence.

It is so meaningless to be God. You have no idea. I am responsible for everything that happens to me as well as everything that happens to you. How did I come into existence? I am not talking about the fiction of sperm and egg cell, but I am talking about for all of eternity.",0

KFLAOD also has a value system in which all people, not just those of which subscribe to it, are judged. Certain things will put you lower and certain things will put you higher. These are based entirely on our feelings as well.

Now, I've met people who seem to just have constant bad luck in that if anything can go wrong then it will \- if they buy a ticket their name will be spelled wrong, any time they exceed the speed limit or overstay their parking they get a ticket, when they buy something its broken, their accounts get hacked, important things of theirs get lost.  As much as they try, they just can't catch a break.

This got me thinking as to how could this be?  If there is no karma or destiny or invisible hand guiding me through life's pitfalls, why is my luck so different to other people's?

Our systems rule us most ultimately, and under this state of affairs humans are meaningless in themselves, their only purpose to be processed into the hosts of mental informational parasites. God is only one of these parasites, and with global civilization they have formed a symbiotic alliance based on shared interests: the subversion of our cognitive immune systems that is their only enemies apart from themselves. The subversion of skepticism and critical thought. As this global machine of soul destruction continues to grow in power we are seeing more and more insanity, more pandemics of hysterias and delusions,  more diversions from the IMMINENT EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMANITY that is our credulity and lack of reality-checking.

Now I know a lot of you are wondering just who in the FUCK I am. Well let first tell you that I am a long time member of this here community, and I'm using an alt account for NO REASON, just to prove that I'm a true nihilist. Suffice to say, I am the most respected member of this community, and you personally have upvoted me countless times. I have a Ph.D in philosophy and am a high school drop-out so I'm the best and worst of both worlds. I was put on this planet to be the great uniter of the nihilists; to be the leader of the leaderless. And there is only one rule here: obedience. 

Now I am not a tyrant who expects you to strict orders. No, I recognize that you are not sheeple like the rest of humanity. When I give you a mission, I expect you to take creative license with it; follow the spirit of the law not the letter. Since you are a wholly free and autonomous entity, you are also 100% accountable for your own actions. 

We will not be doing any evil here. If that was your hope, you have come to the wrong place. We are a nihilist army you fucking retard. Evil doesn't exist. We also won't be doing any good. We will be doing what the God of Nihilism tells us to do.

Your first mission is pretty straightforward. Now you may not understand what all of these missions are building up to, but I assure you, they have a purpose, unlike your worthless existence. Your first mission is to call your mother and tell her you love her. Now I don't want to hear any fucking excuses as to why you didn't follow orders! Your mom is dead? Call someone else you are supposed to love. Hate your mom? Tell her it was just a prank. Live with your mom? Call her while you are in the same room as her. Get creative you fucking maggots! 

Go fulfill your first mission as part of the nihilist army and comment below your story as to what happened. Tell us how it felt. Tell us what they said. Tell us whatever you think you should tell us. What will not be tolerated is dissent. As part of the nihilist army, you must downvote into oblivion any dissenting voices.

Now go. Call your mother. Report back ASAP.

Why do we berate people who are uncivilized ? Savages, terrorists, procrastinators, the mentally ill, trolls, anarchists...

Ultimately, even atheists, non believers and agnostic people will hold the beliefs that humans who are not civilized and well educated and taught, are not deemed worthy of the modern developed world.

When I roam about the science of psychology, conditioning and behavior, one can easily make the conclusion that religion was a very strong force in shaping not just customs, but the mode of thinking of how society should evolve across generations of ages: the more we enter a mold of thoughts, the more harmonious society seems to be.

Don't you think religion left marks on how and why we still believe ? I heard Gad Saad say our brains evolved because religion helped us think more.

If one believe in evolution and conditioning, can't he deduce that ""bad"", ""good"" and ""evil"" are just remains of a religious though system? Don't those words belong to the past?

Whenever I catch myself stressing out over some trivial thing I remind myself that when I die and consciousness leaves my body this shit won’t matter and it calms me down. I have free will and near infinite things to do with my time so I try my best to have fun every day and explore new experiences always. Life to me has never been boring and honestly I don’t think it ever will. If you hate your job, quit. If you hate your marriage, divorce. If you hate your home, move. Find hobbies and when you’re tired of your old hobbies find new ones. Life is fun, enjoy it.",0

Nihilism is not about rejecting everybody and everything.
Nihilism is not suicidality.

If you are bored, get out.
If you are misanthropist, get out.

1463401847.0,So it's official I'm a Dudeist and a Nihilist,"I watched the Big Lebowski like how everyone on here was speaking about it. I then realized that "" the dude"" was a calm, chilled , smooth guy with not much stress or shits given . I went to the BiG Lebowski sub reddit and asked how can I be more like the dude and a user their introduced me to Dudesm .So basically I'm a Dudeist now but I've always been a Nihilist. I know it seems contradictory doesn't it? Let me clear things up, I'm mostly just an existential nihilist . I don't believe life has a meaning or purpose but the way I want to live my life is as a Dudeist , it's closely related to Zen and Taoism , There's no God in Dudeism , it's basically just a religion of peace ,being chilled  , valuing friendship and life's simple things over Money and Material positions , it doesn't care about Social Status. So this lifestyle is very appealing to me I also care about people and I don't like being a jerk . It keeps me very calm , I know at the end of the day I will die and so will everyone else and nothing would have mattered but this lifestyle brings me peace. Thus I'm a "" Dudeist Nihilist"" :) ",0
1402154388.0,My six working principles of nihilism how could they be improved,"1.Everything that exists,exists for the sole purpose of it's end; Nothing else   
   - 




 
 
 

2.Morality does not exist as part of nature but only in the hearts and minds of individuals and society.  

-   








3.You arose from dust and you will go back to dust,ultimately you will never change anything.  -   


-    




 

 


4.Utility and value are nonsense words to the universe, clinging to things will only hurt yourself as time and causality will take it all away.-  








5.Life consists of mere fleeting moments, when ever you strive for pleasure it will be alive for one moment and dead the next, causing us to continuously chase it for it to be renewed.In this life when we are with someone we are like two cars passing each other, coming together for a brief instant,but separating in the blink of an eye -  






6.The size and nature of the universe is completely irrelevant. It's the very nature of existence itself that makes everything pointless. 


These principles give me a new sense of liberation,it does give us more responsibility as  the universe won't punish us for ""negative"" actions though.Never the less embracing nihilism eventually leads to [peace](http://i.imgur.com/tVHGYk1.gif)",0

1696989891.0,"Our World. Our Selves. Our social world determines our self. We can build any social world we want. At least, for the next line of selves.","The issue here is that we define complex behavioral traits by how they manifest in us as adults. Most of these traits are complex traits that we experience. They run through our brain/minds. That is, there is imagery, emotion, feeling, and even linguistic description that we give to them. We end up with a disjunction between societal definitions and what is actually being created by genetic material. It is a large disjunction. The analyzing of human behavioral traits from genetic material has been hopelessly flawed. At least, as the program has so far been laid out.

([A YouTube video](https://youtu.be/pSF1MPJS2qU?si=b4Y-6SyVM_LV2SEk)(7 min) where I say the same thing as below.)

Sexuality, gender, and pretty much everything about our selves is capable of being done completely differently. This is made abundantly clear with a simple thought experiment. If your DNA was put into a single sex society, that had no knowledge, no concept, and no imagery of the other sex, including in animals, what sexuality would you be? What gender would you be?

Your genes are cheap. We can build different selves out of our same DNA that would be radically different, robust selves. To do so, we would have to build radically different social worlds. We have to accept, as reflective beings, that we can build radically different social worlds. We are very slowly socialized into our environment. We very slowly become complex selves, full of all the thoughts and imagery that flow through us.

Let's say our sexuality was completely determined by pheromones. For all of human history, we just live our lives in particular societies and allow beliefs and definitions of sexuality to arise. We, our selves, do not desire pheromones. We desire bodies, behaviors, appearances, whatever you desire in people. That is, when we experience our sexuality, it is a complex mental and emotional phenomena. So, we figure out that the entirety of our sexuality is this complex mental phenomena laid atop pheromones. Scientists isolate these pheromones. They spray the pheromone on a hamster and people start having emotional feelings towards hamsters. That may be something you would have to do in an early age before a person attaches sexual emotions and imagery to humans. If the pheromone story was the case, and discovered, and we did this a hundred years ago, many of the discussions about identity and behavior would have been different. We would have been more willing to destabilize the structure of our selves and world. I think many people would be more willing to hold their self at arm's length. They would see the accidentality of how genes and non-reflective parents/society allowed for a non-critical world to be set up around their DNA. They would see more of the story of why they are what they are.

Though our actual biology is more complicated than the pheromone story, this is essentially what is wrong with putting many of our behavioral traits into genetic schemata. Our genes do not lead to the kind of social world and selves that we see, unless you want to argue some long term deterministic, dialectic buildup across history. We are reflective beings. We can create any social world we want. At least as a species or community. The study of heritability, twin studies, and evolutionary psychology have constantly hit their head against such a problem. The problem is not in evolutionary and genetic paradigms. The problem is in overstating and solidifying psychology and behavioral traits that have immensely complex components. Language allows for self-reflection and self-blossoming in fabulous ways. The programming of our brains by genes/environment is wonderfully complex.

Let me give another thought experiment. We are travelling on a spaceship in the future. The idea is that we have created a single sex society and environment (And make no mistake, though a thought experiment, we could do the fundamentals of this today). Let's go all males. This ship has an AI program and artificial womb technology that has stored millions of fertilized eggs (or we just finagle cells). These males are raised to be knowledgeable but we deny them knowledge of females, across all life forms. That is, they have no imagery of female bodies or the concept of female altogether. Let's say they have the same spread of male genetics as society today. What sexuality are these males? I am telling you, right now, they are not desiring female bodies. Evolution did not program brains that have imagery of female bodies. Evolution did not need to do that. Whatever genes do to create sexual desire, it is worlds away from societal definitions and personal experiences.

It is not good enough in this day and age to say that a trait is a combination of genes and environment. Behavior and identity traits are fundamental to our selves. If we are not telling a good story about how they arise, then we are failing to tell a baseline story about why we are the way we are. This also means that we have trouble analyzing our contingent social world. Taking these traits as part and parcel of our selves has created a givenness to our characteristics. On an individual level, as we probe our own thoughts, it makes sense that we experience these things as they are given. Academically, and for purposes of self discovery, we need to tell better stories. As reflective beings, we need to remind people that we can build any self and any world (within reason) that we want.

Just to sidestep this, I fully support LGBTQ rights. That does not mean we retreat into our selves and into our world. Given the difficulties of unraveling our programming by genes and environment, I argue that we should, generally, put knowledge attainment before reproduction of self and society.
