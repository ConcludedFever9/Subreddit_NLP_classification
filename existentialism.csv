1704665862.0,Subjectivity is the Starting Point,"*The word subjectivism has two meanings, and our opponents play on the two. Subjectivism means, on the one hand, that an individual chooses and makes himself; and, on the other, that it is impossible for man to transcend human subjectivity. The second of these is the essential meaning of existentialism.*

Jean-Paul Sartre, *Existentialism and Human Emotions*

The core of existentialism, to hear Sartre tell it, is that ""subjectivity is the starting point."" Imposing order on the chaos of being and human experience is just dealing with literature. And if you're starting with Reality, some totalizing construct that you consider self-evident, then you're dealing with secular theology.

This isn't some picayune hair-splitting, it's the very crux of existentialism. Subjectivity may be the starting point, but it's certainly not the end; whatever knowledge we have of history is due to human experience being processed through modes of professional and communal inquiry and organized into a third-person account that's extremely useful as long as we realize how artificial (I didn't want to say ""illusory"") it is.

If we get rid of God, we have to get rid of the concept of a God's-eye-view of reality. Everything we know we owe to human perception and experience, and like all human constructs even our so-called objective methods of inquiry are sodden with the biases of the historically and culturally situated agents who conduct them.",1

1704575455.0,The meaning of existence," 

I had a discussion with friend who is an extreme theistic fanatic and I had no idea how to explain to him what is the actual reason for my existence (by the way, I am an atheist, an evolutionary biologist and just someone who has never asked himself why I am here, but all my life I have only tried to explain to myself that theistic beliefs have failed deeply). I have read a little about what are the philosophical explanations of my existence and as an evolutionary biologist, i.e. someone who understands why a certain species exists (which is primarily reproduction and survival) I would call myself an absurdist But as a member of a species that has extreme intelligence, I cannot understand my life only as food and sex, so i would call myself an existentialist (however chaotic and in a way senseless this life may be, in the sense that some star may explode tomorrow in the vicinity that will destroy us all, each of us simply has to find some reason why he is alive, but he has to find it himself, it must not be imposed by any means), but to some extent I also find myself in nihilist (because I don't really believe anything and I don't accept any norms except those that I would have placed).

I apologize if the question is somewhat stupidly asked or if I misunderstood the point of these philosophical directions. In any case, I am interested in whether what I believe can be classified into one group and whether it is legitimate for a person to accept several philosophical directions if they all fit into his beliefs. I would also like to ask you to recommend some books that would explain the meaning of my existence, but in the light of what was written above.",1

It points to the consciousness being Constant a fluid state that is subjected to change, It is a Very scary thought that what holds us together seems to not be in our Control, How our decisions are dependent in past information and How the now only makes Sense because of that, but even at that, It always makes Sense but not because It really does, but because It needs to.

1704447033.0,"If ""nothing"" cannot exist without the concept of ""something"", is there truly ""nothing"" after death?","I always used to be a hard core atheist that thought this life is it and after we cease to be it's over forever. Which was very comforting to me, I preferred the idea over an eternal afterlife.

But in my mid twenties my philosophy began to change. I began thinking, it doesn't make much sense. Reality has never been 'nothing', because for 'nothing' to exist as a concept of a lack of 'something', then 'something' must too exist.

The argument people make that ""Death is an empty void just like the empty void that came before life"" is an extremely easy to disprove theory in my opinion. Your brain is what holds your consciousness, it is a material thing. It cannot remember what consciousnesses came before and after, it only stores information locally. So if we lived as infinite consciousnesses forever before and after being a human, our brain simply would never know.

What is your guys's take on this? This is all a bit of a batshit crazy theory but it's what I truly believe, when we die, we will experience 'everything' that can and will exist as long as time and reality is an infinite thing, and through our different consciousnesses, we will likely never remember anything that came before or after.

Or, even more bizzarely, we may be born into a consciousness that randomly had all the thoughts of all its previous and future existences stored locally through complete random chance, and then you would die and be reborn as a bird or some shit. Or you may be reborn in eternal hell or an eternal orgy. Basically anything that can happen will happen.",1

Let’s imagine Planet Earth, same as now, same problems with politics and economy, same dark and mysterious universe, same laundry to do, everything as we currently now. 

The only difference, is that we are immortal, so forever doomed to live. 
And I mean, totally immortal, you could jump in a volcano and still you won’t die. Like in GTA, you just wake up outside an hospital in the nearest city in no time. 

Every human would reach a certain age and then stop aging, meaning you won’t live pain and all the problems related to old people.

1704400295.0,"Yalom's Take: Individual Responsibility in Existentialism?""","Diving into existentialism and getting into Dr. Irvin Yalom's ""Love's Executioner,"" I stumbled upon a passage that got me thinking. Yalom drops this line: ""Since patients tend to resist assuming responsibility, therapists must develop techniques to make patients aware of how they themselves create their own problems."" It's a glimpse into Yalom's take on therapy, putting a strong emphasis on personal responsibility in tackling mental health challenges.

But as I read this, I couldn't shake the feeling that there might be something missing. The complexity of how internalized issues intertwine with external factors, especially for folks facing unique challenges, seemed to take a back seat. The quote kind of suggests that individuals bear the full weight of their problems, making me wonder if Yalom might be inadvertently sidelining the socio-political aspects that contribute to mental health struggles. This concern becomes even more pronounced when considering the experiences of marginalized groups.

Being a newbie to existentialism, I'm eager to figure out if this focus on individual responsibility is a recurring theme in the broader philosophy or if it's more of a Yalom thing. Is it a fundamental aspect of existential thought, or is there room within the philosophy to grapple with the intricacies of socio-political contexts? I'm curious if anyone can shed light on whether Yalom's works generally navigate these complexities or if existentialism tends to lean towards the idea that all problems are self-created.",1

An axiom is a presupposed, given truth. It is not proven, it is assumed to be true for the proceeding endeavor, such as logical reasoning.

The existence of physical reality is predicated on the axiom that it exists. We cannot prove that it exists. We assume that it does. 

All that we know, is that we experience. We assume that just because we have a map, that there is a territory.

Scientific observation requires experience. Measuring equipment is observed.

Experience is not reliable. Therefore, the scientific method is not, in all intellectual honesty, reliable.

Is the scientific method useful? In that paradigm, yes.

But in terms of pure logical honesty, it is axiomatic.

Assuming that our experience is reliable, physical reality is real.

Like a mushroom coming to the surface. In fact the mushroom is only the fleshy fruit body of the much bigger fungal network in the soil. If the mushroom gets eaten or cut off it doesn't affect the fungal network underground. Similarly we could be seen like a fruit growing out of this world. We identify with this ""fruit"" and we say we are a separate being. Therefore many people are terrified by the thought of death and disappearing into nothingness forever. Because we are just this little mushroom on the surface, isolated, fragile and helpless against all the predators and dangers, standing there alone not knowing where we came from and where we're heading, not knowing that we are connected with the giant fungal network in the ground, that we in fact are this whole network. 
Another example is golden jewelry. There are all kinds of forms, rings, chains, crosses etc. made from gold. But in fact the nature of all these different items is not its form but the gold itself. The form of the gold is just in our minds, our minds give meaning to it. But it can be molten and remodeled into other shapes and it remains just gold.

The state we are in now, thinking of ourselves as separate beings that have a start and an end, would be fake and the state after and before it would be the reality.

1703995902.0,Kierkegaard on authenticity: Detachment is only the first step,"Kierkegaard's first major work was his master's thesis, ""[On the Concept of Irony.](https://archive.org/details/kierkegaard-soren-the-concept-of-irony)"" Part Two in particular lays out the program of passionate authenticity that Kierkegaard would explore for the rest of his life.

I mentally divide the program into two steps.

Step One is the mode of being most associated with existentialism in the public mind. He recommends an ironic distance from the world, society, organized religion and even moral values. This allows one to ""negate the world"" and shed the false identities that are imposed upon us.

This rejection of artificial values and counterfeit essences can be found in many practices, ancient and modern. Everything from Buddhism to stoicism to self-help books preach the idea of ""radical detachment.""

But it's Kierkegaard's second step that gives his thought power. He believed that radical detachment must be followed by radical ATTachment.

Kierkegaard described people who never move on from Step One as ""ironists.""

“In order to really and thoroughly to be able to create himself poetically, the ironist must have no an sich. \[in itself\]…. Therefore the ironist frequently becomes nothing, because what is not true for God is true for man — out of nothing comes nothing. But the ironist continually preserves his poetic freedom, and when he notices that he is becoming nothing, he includes that in his poetizing.”

Kierkegaard does \*not\* believe that we're free to become whoever we want or choose our own values -- at least not if we want to have a life with any meaning.

“Irony is indeed free, free from the sorrows of actuality, but also free from its joys, free from its blessing, for inasmuch as it has nothing higher than itself, it can receive no blessing, since it is always the lesser that is blessed by the greater.”

Kierkegaard believed that giving oneself to God was the path to authenticity - as long as this was an authentic faith.

Dostoevsky, the other great Christian proto-existentialist, famously used a Biblical metaphor to describe this two-step path of death and rebirth: ""Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain, but if it dies it bears much fruit.""

What do you think? Personally, I find myself continuously examining my life for inauthenticity and working to live in a genuine way. It's enormously fulfilling.",1

1703959497.0,Existentialism Theory of Everything vs. Nothing,"I'd like to try to explain a theory of existence that I've been kicking around in my head, and I will do my best to explain it.

Simply, we exist because we have to. Because at the very base of everything is the fact that there is either existence or non-existence. There are the mathematical expressions (forgive me, I will not use the correct mathematical terminology, as I am not an expert in math, or existentialism, or anything related - these are just my ideas) for ZERO, and then anything but zero. There's Yin and Yang, positive and negative, etc. We exist because there IS and because there is NOT. What I mean by that, is the moment there became anything positive or negative, observable or non-observable, with or without matter or energy, there instantaneously became something that is either negative or positive. I believe this is fairly well supported in math and that most proven theories have a counterpart in mathematics. Afterall, there cannot be something if there is no such thing as nothing. 

Last night, I was watching an episode of ""Under the Dome"", and I started wondering to myself what side of the dome would be more affected by the fact that these people were stuck in a dome with no communication. Would the impact of such a situation be greater on these people inside the dome or outside the dome? Mathematically, there is far more outside of that point in space-time than there is inside, so wouldn't it be safe to assume that the greater effect is on what is outside of the dome? We can call this dark matter or dark energy in this theory. 

https://preview.redd.it/2u9e2l5b2h9c1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=083c967606055d8def2d907109410748e86bd9a8

**My theory is that we exist at the intersection of oneness, and nothingness, and that everything we see, feel, observe, etc. is all a result of those two universal forces pulling on each other.** 

I think that the thing that we should be doing our best to understand and map is the **nothing**, the zero, the anti-matter, the anti-anything. For example, at any given point in space time, there may be something observable or there may be nothing. If we are considering that which is observed, I think we need to only look at what ISNT observable. The Yang, the negative, the infinite. That is where the math stops because we cannot breach that terminal line in space and time. We only call it dark matter or dark energy. What if we were able to plot everything that ISNT at a given point in space time (I know the math would be unimaginable large and require more computing power than is likely possible)? 

Basically, what I'm saying, is the REAL is everything that we currently perceive as not. Imagine taking a very large, very intricate black and white picture, where most of the picture is black, but there is an obvious observable image made of up white pixels. Now, take that picture and invert the colors so that everything that was previously black is white and vice-versa. Now, do this with everything that is observable in the universe at a given point in space and time. Everything would assume it's mathematical or observable opposite and THAT is what we would look at. Blues would be orange, blacks would be white, reds would be green and so on, but with ***everything***. something that would be classified as a 2 would be a -2. Everything with matter (or mass) would be measured as the complete opposite. Something that appeared as having zero matter, zero energy, or zero mass would be measured as having infinite matter, mass, or energy. Do this with everything and map it. I know, it's a lot, but the universe is a big thing. 

This is why I tend to believe that we are a program. The reason there is unobservable anything is because it's on the other side of what is ""real"" and what is programmed"". Because of this terminal point in space/time, we can and will never be able to observe anything on the other side. It's written into the coding at the very beginning and acts (through mathematics) as a boundary that cannot be crossed. It will never matter how much progress we make in the sciences of gravity, light, or other fundamental forces because they are all, at one point, even if VERY difficult, observable. They're observable because they are of the basic coding/building blocks of our ""existence"". I would even venture to guess that we are ""alien"" or ""viral"" lines of code. Self-replicating, quickly spreading, malignant-at-times, lines of code that have the ability to destroy or create other like code. I believe that when UAPs, religious, biblical, and other instances of ""seemingly impossible"" or other-worldly occurrences have happened is due to active interference by a force capable of changing our coding or the coding of the ""world"" we live in. These things are being coded into existence and then ""displayed"" for us through our abilities to observe in order to push civilization in one way or another. This active interference is more of a reason to consider that we may be a program. Is it more likely that aliens from outer space are coming to visit us, or is it more likely that whatever we are witnessing (more often than ever before) is something that's already here, overlaid on top of our existence, but on the other side of the mathematical wall that prevents us from observing them? I think that's where the ""real"" in the universe exists and that we are only lines of code. 

We've all heard the Ufologists talk about, ""What could be so dark that they refuse to let the world know?"" Well, think about it for a moment. Imagine that scientists were able to confidently discern that we were almost certainly programmed into existence? What if our purpose was simple to be the oil in a machine? How would people feel about knowing that another force could end us instantly at any time? What if what seems like an eternity to humans (thousands even millions of years) is experienced to our creators in the same way that we experience hours? What if the end of our civilization was determined simply by when our programmers become bored of their latest hobby? I think this is one of the darker paths that have been postulated and I think it's dark enough for a secret to be kept.

1703946635.0,Who is Man who we are and speak of,"I wish to know of your perspectives on the concept of Man, whether you can answer or dissolve the question of the meaning of Man. Who or what is Man? Heidegger: the being for whom Being is an issue (Dasein). The Socratics: the rational animal (*animal rationale*). Cassirer: the symbolic animal (*animal symbolicum*).

However you answer, whether you undertake the synthetic approach (wherein Man is seen as a totality) as opposed to the ""reductionistic"" analytic approach (wherein Man is seen as a mere composite of parts), it does not matter. I simply wish to know what you think of Man. Do we reduce the answer to a biologism or psychologism? 

If I am to give a definition, I am less for the tendency to mathematically define Man as an abstract, bloodless, rigid, formal genus through a theoretical/disembodied view-from-nowhere than for the tendency to otherwise conceive of Man in his very concreteness, in flesh and bones, as a living, breathing being, as we see a fellow human being, understanding Man from ourselves, through ourselves. 

I posit that we already have a good know-how/tacit knowledge of Man. It shows in our dealings in our everydayness and how we treat different things differently. Otherwise, how will we even question the concept of Man? This is to circumvent Meno's Paradox. Heidegger did the same thing but with Being. I'm merely regurgitating to make a point. One might say that all what is left of us, then, is to uncover from the surface phenomena the underlying patterns of psycho-statistical registers or social functionings. One might even say that we can penetrate through the fluidity and multiplicity of Man to reach the universality/essence of Man by means of dialogical inquiry.",1

1703878641.0,"Birthdays Make Life Feel More Absurd than Usual, Why Am I Still Here at 24?","Turned 24 today and I've found myself from last night and waking up this morning to now in almost a constant state of laughter about how absurd this all is. 

It started in the shower last night enjoying scrubbing my head with shampoo and the hot water running down my body and just thought to myself that I'm happy to be in a hot shower and to have made it to 24. But then in great absurdist fashion I found myself thinking at any moment a freak accident could occur, that it's possible shampoo could come running down into my eye, I could freak out, slip, fall, and break my neck and die. And I think in the past before I started thinking about philosophies like existentialism and absurdism this thought would've made me paranoid, but instead I couldn't stop myself from giggling about it.

I think the giggling turned into a general laughing about why have I made it to 24 and how absurd it is that I'm still here when I currently have no real goal or movement towards something greater than my current life. And also how absurd it is that many people who did have aspirations centered around a greater goal or movement are no longer with us.

You hear stories all the time of honor roll college students or teenagers with huge aspirations being victim to freak accidents or crime or violence. You hear stories of people who are in roles or were wishing to become occupations like doctors, lawyers, scientists, et cetera dying tragic deaths. You hear or watch stories of children dying due to wars or child labor across the world. All people with a ton of potential towards the ""greater good"" of the world, people who are hard workers. 

And then I think about myself. I will preface it with I have worked hard for many things and had many goals accomplished. I did very good in grade school and got into a great university. I busted my ass working through college and with my full time job afterwards to be able to afford a house and set myself up for a decent life. However this year, now that this is all done, I've realized that these were essentially all of the goals I had. In addition to this I also feel like I've felt everything I've always wanted to whether it was love or accomplishment or ecstasy, so I'm just sort of lost.

So I think this birthday has settled in me that I'm just quite ambivalent towards life currently and I'm finding the conflict of it absurd. On one hand I'm enjoying how inconsequential my life feels now, but on the other there is a bit of guiltiness as to being on this Earth and knowing how consequential life can be if you work hard for it, but I don't wish to work hard anymore, so why essentially am I still here?

1703821533.0,What do you guys think?,"New here, just looking for a place to share some feelings and ideas with others and see if anything resonates. All opinions welcomed, just wanted an opportunity to write some thoughts down for once and see what happens.

I was always atheist and nihilistic growing up, but as I've got older, I've become convinced that there is some kind of higher power beyond this life, just not necessarily in the guise of any of the established religions practiced around the world.

While I can't effectively describe what I sense this higher power to be, the only thing I feel certain of is that how we morally behave in this life determines what comes next (whatever that may be). Essentially the same as heaven and hell, but just not confined to how it is portrayed in Christianity. 

For example, if this life was just a simulation run by an advanced species, I still think at the end you would be judged on how kind, honest, fair and hardworking you were, as opposed to how financially successful you were, etc.

Since developing this view, I've realised that most of my values align with the virtues of many religions - so while I do not consider myself religious per se, I fully appreciate and respect what it means for people to try and 'walk with god' and to strive to be good people in spite of the hardships of their lives. (I hate it when people automatically dismiss religion as something negative or outdated without fair appreciation for what it can offer those who practice it in the right way).

We are all born into vastly uneven circumstances and it all appears so random and often grossly unfair, so I can understand why some people are skeptical of a god - but the only leveller I can see for nearly everyone is our capacity to choose whether to be a good person or not, and that for me is the true measure of a person. If you can be a grateful, caring, courageous person born into poverty, disability and adversity, you are living a much more successful life than a selfish, covetous millionaire born into total security and comfort - in my view.

This world is completely random and at times, downright chaos. But what better way to judge someone's character than by seeing how they behave when dropped into a completely random arena with no clear set of instructions on how to behave? That's what I think this life is.

Challenging to condense this post down into the main points I hoped to get across without rambling, although I fear I may already be doing that so I'd better leave it there. Just glad of an opportunity to verbalise these thoughts and see if anyone else shares my non-theistic view of morality and a potential afterlife, which also happens to share some similarities with the views of some religions.

I’m gonna dive into existentialist philosophy(and contrasting stances) in my gap year come September, here’s my plan so far:","I’m going to begin with At The Existentialist Cafe by Sarah Bakewell because it is apparently a rather comprehensive but easy introduction. I will then move onto the father of existentialism with Søren Kierkegaard’s Either/Or (primarily because of the Elliot Smith album), followed by The Concept of Anxiety. Next, I’ll read Existentialism and Humanism by Jean-Paul Sartre because it is not as long as his other essential works. I’ll then read The Myth of Sisyphus and The Stranger by Albert Camus for a second time, followed by my first read of The Rebel. Afterwards, having already read Metamorphosis countless times, I’ll give The Trial a second read and The Castle I’ll read for the first time. Having hopefully cultivated better existentialist literacy at this point (and I’ll have hopefully already read some of his Essays and Aphorisms), I’ll get into Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation. This is mainly because I’m conscious of how essential his influence is to absurdism (which I’ll have just covered) and Nietzsche (who I’ll be getting into next. This is where I’m a little uncertain. I’m hesitant to move into his more dense and difficult works until after my undergraduate, so I’m thinking of starting with The Antichrist and Beyond Good and Evil, but I’m unsure if this is a good place to start.

I apologise for everybody screwing up earlier, this time I promise that we'll proceed with a clear vision for the subreddit and that we'll actively cooperate with you all to bring that vision to life.

Right now I need to address the issue of mental health posts. There is room for discussion of depression, anxiety, suicide, etc. in philosophy but the sub as it exists now doesn't promote this kind of discussion. If you're struggling with your mental health then you should ideally seek professional help but at the very least you should find a supportive friend/an actual mental health subreddit to properly address your feelings. That your worries might correspond to a particular theory or debate in philosophy does not mean philosophy will offer you a solution, nor do people need an interest in philosophy to understand them. Nobody handles climate change anxiety by talking to sociologists, it is treated as a mental health problem like any other.

In a recent post, somebody was frustrated over having spent *6 years* here out of desperation with no results, they only stayed because they didn't think anyone else would understand how they felt. Someone else answered that the masses are too stupid to understand philosophy and that their random eclectic philosophy is the solution instead. There's simply nothing about existential crises that are incomprehensible to ordinary people, and the *years* they've wasted listening to snake oil salesmen such as that person are years in which they could have found real support from people who care about their feelings. In fact, a *real* mental health subreddit would have pointed out the nature of his problem almost immediately. This community (although it's mostly the fault of us mods) has really failed this person by not drawing a fine line between philosophy and existential crises.

If you want to support someone with their mental health, or if you're here for a personal reason and want to know what proper support would look like: read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/talking_tips/) excellent post by a hotline advisor. It's about suicide but much of it is generalisable - arguing people's feelings as people do in this subreddit is a terrible idea. If you're obsessed with whether a particular theory is true or not in a way that affects your mental health then you might have [OCD](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-obsession-existential-and-philosophical-ocd/#:~:text=Existential%20OCD%20involves%20intrusive%2C%20repetitive,or%20even%20one's%20own%20existence) \- either way the last thing you should be doing is feeding this obsession with philosophy.

When we start making changes we'll be updating the community and looking for feedback as to make this a shift the community can buy into, so we aren't doing any hard content bans yet.

In fact, I don't understand why this idea is considered the most ""rational"". 

Many assume that as our neurons no longer work, everything stops. Indefinitely. For eternity: Nothing.

I specify once again that I have no problem with this idea but I wonder why this idea is considered by many to be the most ""rational"". Why is the field of vision not wider?

When we die, we will no longer exist, it is factual. But can we really think that from non-existence nothing is possible anymore? In this case, if we think that then how to explain that from the inexistence we ended up existing at our birth?

Can we really believe in an eternal nothingness (or to make more ""poetic"" in an eternal rest)? If the universe is not eternal, how can we think that non-existence is eternal?

In fact, I think that even non-existence is not eternal, I see our birth as a formal proof that non-existence cannot be an eternal purpose.

I know you the reader, knows absolutely nothing about me. But these are the thoughts that race in my head continuously. And I feel like writing them down. I want to explain how I feel, what I think, and hopefully find peace, true peace of mind. Whatever that means, especially in todays society, where you cant be given the time of day to actually sit down and decompress thoughts and feelings appropriately. I know theres stuff like therapy, which I do not have the means to go and do, that’s why I am here. Talking in a mess of OCD rantings. 

Anyways, do you know what is a weird? Getting thoughts or feelings that feel, well, weird, thoughts that you can’t really explain properly, but the thought is just so intense or off putting.  Is that just me? Like an example is the thought of being alive, me, you, a sentient being in an unknown universe, full of unknowing possibilities. And that thought that all that keeps me here to experience this is my heart pumping blood throughout my body to my brain, that thought to me is scary, it is insane to me. It makes me feel insecure, like I have no control over myself and everything that happens in my life. I know that’s OCD probably, and anxiety as well, the unwillingness to accept uncertainty. These should be natural thoughts, but I keep them pent up in my head, like a tense ball of energy. I am a tense ball of energy. I don’t like to be so existential all of the time about everything, but I am, and I can control the thoughts I get, so why not write them down? It feels so terrifying thinking about all of these crazy uncertainties. Its like I see something others don’t, why me? Am I cursed? Or is it a gift I haven’t seen yet. Because I truly love this life, there’s so many cool things out there in this universe I want to experience and see. People, animals, environments, the earth, stars, moons, the universe. Where am I in all of this, stuck in my room contemplating if I am insane (I most certainly am). But this feels good, talking about the thoughts. 

I still feel stuck in my life, like I don’t know where its going, like purgatory, am I a bird trapped in a cage? Or am I a bird that’s sitting in the cage with the door unlocked but that’s too scared to check if I can be free? I guess we will have to see who releases me from my cage.

So all these concepts of god is what humanity have fabricated to conceal our fear of death. 

I guess when you really become aware of it there is no way back to ‘normalcy’. You cannot ignore your own fate. But that certainty is so absolute that at some point you cannot keep living.

[?](https://preview.redd.it/yq5vk1czs88c1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef268dd44c883bce88aebe9ab6850f79f44d80c)

This article is intended for philosophical discussion only and does not suggest that one cannot enjoy life or should cease living; if you are experiencing psychological distress, please seek professional help before delving into these profound topics.

## The Proof:

1. **Foundation in Determinism and Physicalism:** As established, all phenomena, including human consciousness and decision-making, are governed by deterministic physical laws. This framework negates the existence of free will and independent agency.
2. **The Illusion of the Self:** The 'self' is an emergent property of complex neurological processes, not an independent entity. This understanding implies that the beliefs, desires, and motivations we attribute to our 'selves' are also products of deterministic processes.
3. **Absurdity of Self-Created Meaning:** Since the self is not an independent entity, and our thoughts and desires are products of deterministic processes, the concept of creating one's own meaning is inherently flawed. The idea of ""creating meaning"" presumes an agency and self that are illusory.
4. **Meaning as a Human Construct:** Any meaning that individuals believe they are creating is itself a result of deterministic processes. It is not an authentic expression of free will or personal agency, but rather a byproduct of the same deterministic laws governing all other phenomena.
5. **Circularity and Lack of Foundation:** The act of creating meaning is based on the premise of having a self capable of independent thought and decision-making. Since this premise is invalid (as per the deterministic and physicalist view), the act of creating meaning becomes a circular and baseless endeavor.
6. **Inherent Meaninglessness Remains Unresolved:** Consequently, attempting to create one's own meaning does not address the fundamental issue of life's inherent meaninglessness. It is merely a distraction or a coping mechanism, not a logical or effective solution to the existential dilemma.

**Conclusion:**

* **Futility of Creating Meaning:** In a deterministic and physicalist framework, where the self is an illusion and free will does not exist, the endeavor to create one's own meaning is both absurd and meaningless. It does not provide a genuine escape from the inherent meaninglessness of life, but rather represents an illogical and futile attempt to impose order on an indifferent universe.
* **The Paradox of Perceived Control:** While we are essentially prisoners in the deterministic game of life, our inability to perceive ourselves purely as biological machines compels us to live as if we possess independent agency. This paradoxical situation allows us to continue our lives under the illusion of control. However, the awareness that this control is indeed an illusion shatters the enchantment of our existence. This realization makes it challenging to overcome the sense of life's meaninglessness. In this context, there is no ultimate solution or definitive goal. Distinctions between choices like not to continue life, indulging in hedonism, adopting stoicism, or embracing any other worldview become inconsequential.

Ultimately, in a deterministic universe where free will is an illusion, nothing holds intrinsic significance or value. This perspective leads to the conclusion that all choices are equally meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

1703276291.0,Ontological Experiences (Example: 'You were born in the wrong era') - Discussion & Invitation,"I've been a lurker here for a while, and recently felt inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/18ojbix/we_should_legitimately_name_this_place_rnihilism/) (versions of which pop up now and again) bemoaning what some see as unconstructive/self-indulgent posts, wherein OPs maunder nihilistically in their existential angst. The main objection apparently being that the resignation, despair, hopelessness (etc.,) being expressed falls short of the kind of committed engagement with and exploration of said angst-inducing experiences that existential philosophy is all about.

I don't want to add more fuel to the fire, as I truly believe many who make such 'venting' style posts about their angst are motivated by genuine, overwhelming suffering. Like so many of us, they are sensitive to burdensome ontological truths of the human condition, and are wrestling with them.

That said (and in response to the critique being voiced and echoed in the [aforementioned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/18ojbix/we_should_legitimately_name_this_place_rnihilism/)), maybe we could give a more 'committed engagement' and 'exploration' a shot?

As an example, I was playing the video game *Fate/Samurai Remnant* earlier today, and had to pause when one character said to another, in a mournful, commiserating tone: ""You were born in the wrong era"". I was struck by the inchoate anxiety I experienced as I tried to imagine myself being told such a thing, while identifying with it as true. Of being a person whose values and sensibilities seem to clash so greatly with the mores of the prevailing culture that I would feel utterly unmoored in my own worldly existence. In this regard, I think Heidegger did an excellent job when he characterized such 'uncanny' experiences of ontological anxiety (wherein meaningful and coherent orientation in the world collapses) as: ""the 'nothing and nowhere' \[...of...\] 'not-being-at-home'"" (*BT*, p.233) in one's being-in-the-world.

Then, as I dwelled further with this unsettling experience I was trying to vicariously immerse myself in, another emotional layer of the ontological experience began to surface. Somehow, as much as it might feel comforting to be told by someone, in a commiserating tone: ""You were born in the wrong era"", I also feel that there is something very disquieting about receiving that message from the Other. Specifically, the experience of someone else encapsulating the totality of your disquiet with your own worldly existence in a pithy, 7 word platitude (a disquiet you yourself may yet to have actually put into words, up until now). This is the kind of self-alienation/dislocation Sartre discusses in his analysis of 'the Look'. Certainly, what can feel dislocating about 'the Look' is when the Other's objectification of you is incorrect, yet you cannot control it. This means reckoning with the ontological truth that part of who we are is our 'being-for-others', and the Other's judgement(s) can be wildly in contrast with our own self-construal. Yet in the example I give, the Other is instead correct. The person who says: ""You were born in the wrong era"" is identifying something about you, which you may have latently felt, yet never articulated until now. And somehow, I imagine that feeling awful as well. In fact, precisely because it is accurate, it feels as if the Other has somehow 'taken' a discomfiting truth about my worldly existence, and bludgeoned me with it, blindsiding me with an existential realization I would much rather hide from (and may have been somewhat successfully hiding from until now). Yes, the comment was made with the intent to commiserate my misery, but in a way, it has only intensified it by making me more conscious of it, now that I have the actual words to articulate and ruminate over it.

And yet, dwelling further still with this example, additional experiential layers begin to surface. Let's take the phrase once again: ""You were born in the wrong era"". Really dwell with this and where does your mind take you? For me, I begin to try and imaginatively construct the succession of 'eras' in human history, over time, in an effort to properly contextualize what it means to be born into one 'era' in particular. I begin to appreciate the really very tiny window of time I am allotted in my worldly existence, when projected against all that has come before, and all that may come after. And somehow, in imagining this, I feel desperately trapped. I come to regard my 'thrownness' (as Heidegger would call it) as a non-consensual prison sentence, delimiting the worldly possibilities I can hope to access, to only those that sync up with the span of my own mortality. No, more than that, that sync up with my geographic location and the material means (e.g., money) that might empower me to expand my horizons even slightly (while still ultimately being delimited by my era). I feel so utterly small and helpless before this small window of opportunity. And yet, what is the alternative? Just a fantasy I could construct of what it might be like to be an omniscient, eternal god-like entity, who is not delimited in the way I, a mortal, am.

And of course, all of this brings me to my mortality, and my 'being-towards-death', which might prompt yet further layers of experiential depth to this ontological experience, triggered by a single line of dialogue in a video game! Indeed, a line of dialogue I have self-indulgently chosen to extemporize about to strangers over the internet with the sheer stubbornness to read this far (thank you by the way!).

Nevertheless, as distressing, and humbling as all of this is, the emotional exploration also leaves me with something else. I notice that I feel a kind of awe at the sheer depth and breadth of what it means to be a human being, only a sliver of which I have been able to explore via my (incomplete) analysis of this example. There is something... oddly fulfilling about having written this post, unpacking the depths of emotion that are part of my existence as a human being, when I really make the effort to dwell with the complexity of my Being. And at least for me, this fulfilment, this facing of disquieting ontological truths disclosed through things even as 'mundane' as one errant line of dialogue in a video game... it leaves me in a state of wonderment. Perhaps it's merely the natural catharsis that comes from putting latent feelings (however disquieting) into words. Or perhaps it is because, as Heidegger says: ""Dasein's Being is care."" (*BT*, p.329). There is a satisfaction in exercising my natural (dare I say 'essential'?) ownmost 'concernful involvement' with my own Being. A gratification in somehow, paradoxically 'coming home' to myself, to what I am as Dasein, to the ontological truth(s) of my Being, even amidst such experiences of 'not-being-at-home' in my existence, as I have explored in this post.

I wonder if anyone else can recall experiences they've had (either those contacted directly, or imagined vicariously) like the one in this post? I truly believe that a careful phenomenological exploration and existential-hermeneutic analysis of even seemingly mundane experiences can un-conceal the hidden depths of our Being. And as inevitably angst-laden as this process is, I firmly believe that committed exploration can lead to a paradoxical form of fulfilment (authenticity perhaps?), like I've found in my own musings here. Maybe we could work together and unpack some other experiences likewise?",1

1703212411.0,Consciousness After Death...?,"This idea came up to me after I had a quick conversation with my grandma. Her dementia hasn't gotten any better, and it's quick to notice her deteriorating state after asking the same questions moments prior. After she left, I began to ponder what it means to think and ""see"" things. I recalled a previous situation I thought of regarding an inebriated person. The idea goes like this:

""You can only see things as they are in the present, only because you'll remember them in the future""

Say you were utterly drunk, and the next day, you woke up in someone else's room with entirely different clothes. You ask your sober friends what happened, and they recall stating that you went absolutely wild, and trashed the whole place. To you, you were utterly oblivious. You had no recollection, you didn't consciously ""see"" any of the events unfold. It was as if you were accelerated to the future without knowing what happened prior. This effect is even further noticeable if someone suffers from total amnesia. To them, they were suddenly in the body of (say) a 26 year old. It was as if they were born that way. It's because they never remembered what they did prior to contracting amnesia, it was as if they never ""saw"" the things happen at all. 

So, what does this have to do with my theory. Well, considering death is the total loss of life, where everything from your senses, to your consciousness AND your memory is erased, shouldn't we have already accelerated to that point? Like if we are all going to die anyway, why haven't we accelerated in that point in time when all our memories will be lost. Yet, we don't, and maybe the possible reason for it is that, we still have consciousness, in whatever form.

1703181296.0,Detachment as a way to go through life happily,"I have recently came across this idea since most of my life has been defined by pain, suffering and trauma and I always surrendered to my emotions whether it was falling in love, pleasure, sadness or mainly in my life, crying. 

A few months ago I decided I was fed up of always being hit by life and saw that crying didn’t make me feel any better and definitely didn’t solve anything. I would end up in a state of anxiousness, depression and panic attacks but by controlling my thoughts and impulsivity I have been able to not identify with my trauma. Whenever I started to feel bad I just kept a strong mindset by not allowing myself to cry. And that kind of toughens you up. 

With it, I became detached from reality as well. And I think I plan to live like this the rest of my life, because although my life is weird in kind of a third person, at least it shields me from all emotions (good and bad) blocking the potential for suffering and additional trauma which I will have trouble processing. As I keep ageing, traumas become more severe and difficult to handle, so not adding new ones becomes essential by all means necessary.

Sure, I will not fall in love, find anyone, or make any of the plans I once had, but honestly life is a risky business and after reading about another woman who lost her daughter made me think what’s the point of becoming engaged with reality at all? The pleasures are so short-lived and ephemeral life’s unworthy of taking such risks. It feels life will keep hitting us until we become detached from it so it won’t hurt us anymore and then we may wake up from this illusion.

I am wondering if any of you have been at this crossroad and have voluntarily chosen detachment as a healthier way to rule your own lives rather than handling a life where you are driven by your emotions? I initially joined the antinatalism subreddit but I found out the my AN views have nothing do with world population. It is even made out of selfish motives as keeping antinatalist views can help me better cope with my life events based on this detached perspective I am talking about.

1703120458.0,The problem with awakening,"The problem when you start awakening to the reality of this world, seeing that none of our actions are actually done by our free will, that everything we do in our lives is constrained by the laws of physics is very disturbing. Knowing that I have no free will, unless I choose to sacrifice myself. But I must do it from an awakening point of view. The most important thing I’m doing lately is not feel emotions for anything at all, good or bad, I try to keep a passive attitude towards life, either good or bad, and the most difficult thing has been to contain my tears when I’ve been very hurt, but somehow I noticed that my life energy was being sucked every time I cried. I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed a similar thing to this awakening because I’m getting the understanding that if I must have free will as I claim to be I must completely set myself free from this world, by my own sacrifice. Anyone else is dealing with this thought?

I decided to write here instead of in the SuicideWatch Reddit because the attitude and the approach is completely different. The end is the same but the way to get to the other is completely different. When I did in the past I was so overwhelmed and in such anxious emotional state that it prevented me from reaching my goal. But now that I’m trying to reach the same goal, be free from this world, although with a complete different mindset, finding peace in my decision, and instead of ending everything impulsively trying to end it being at peace with myself, awakening to the world around me until this reality can no longer hold me because I’m no longer responding to its emotional triggers.

I think if we get to very deep contemplative meditative states we can in fact transcend this limited reality and achieve our goal of being free from the shackles of this world. However, when we act impulsively and try to hurt ourselves, or end our life violently we get exactly the opposite effect because we are emotionally trapping ourselves into this illusory world  and giving it authority over our sovereign self. It may seem counterintuitive but according to the classic oriental teachings this is what they explain about detachment. 

TL;DR If we really want to die then we must detach from this reality by NOT HURTING OURSELVES acting impulsively because SELF-HARM is a TRAP that keep us BONDED to this 3D dimension through OUR EMOTIONS (which are the dark side of the Light/Force)

1703112682.0,"To grasp existentialism, start with essentialism.","Existentialism says: ""Existence precedes essence."" But what exactly does that mean? How do we organize our thoughts to make sense of it?

A good place to start is to first understand essentialism.

To wrap your mind around essentialism, let's consider a famous actor such as Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington.

From an essentialist point of view, one might say that they were born to be actors. *""Tom and Denzel were born to be actors. That's why they became so great. They were born with something inside of them that led them to pursue acting, and ultimately become highly successful actors.""*

In other words they were born with an ""essence"" inside of them. It was this essence that steered them around into the directions they took. It led them to acting and becoming the actors they became.

An essentialist might also say the same thing about a criminal. ""*He was born to be a criminal. That's why he spent his entire life in crime and ended up in prison. He was a criminal from the day he was born.""*

Here's some other examples from the same line of thinking:

* *""He was born to be a leader.""*
* *""He was born to be a doctor.""*

This is not an uncommon way of thinking. We've all said this kind of stuff about people or even ourselves at one point or another. The notion that people are born with some type of life defining essence or soul inside of them is not a new idea. Most people prefer to believe that everyone has a soul. We even entertain the idea of ""old souls"" or ""young souls"". It's a very old concept that goes back to Greek philosophy and Plato and probably even before that.

Plato believed that everyone is born with an essence: [an eternal occupant of our being.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_theory_of_soul)

That's essentialism in a nutshell: We're born with something inside of us that more or less dictates what we end up doing with our lives. It's the essence, the soul, that came first. Essence precedes existence. 

Now that we understand essentialism and essence, how do we grasp existentialism?

You just flip things around. Existence comes first, THEN essence. The big difference is that the essence have been reduced to essentially nothing. Essence is something that you create on your own. It develops during your life, not before.

An existentialist would probably argue that Tom and Denzel were not born with any type of ""actor essence"" inside of them. An existentialist might say: *""Tom and Denzel were born with a clean slate. Everyone is born with a clean slate. We create our own essence as we grow. The essence of our life is formed through the decisions we make during our own unique life experiences.""*

Existentialism pretty much dismisses the idea that a person is born with some kind of essence or life guiding soul. The idea is that everyone is born with nothing. We create our essence on our own.

So why then did Tom and Denzel become actors? It depends upon how you want to think about it, right? Some might say it's always been with them. It was in their soul from the very start. Others might say it's because of their life experiences, who they were around while they were growing up and how both influenced them.

And now think about yourself. Why did you end up becoming who you are? Is there something on the inside that's been guiding you all along? Or did you make every decision all on your own? If not, then where did this internal essence come from? Did someone create it? Or is it just a phenomena of nature?

How do you prefer to think about it?",1

1703036772.0,Is this Existentialism?,"The innate stillness of your of consciousness is an unwavering resilience within your own existence that is ever present and deeply engrained in your experience of reality. It is this stillness that becomes disrupted and it is this disruption that gives your individual experience of consciousness contextual meaning. If we lose track of this stillness, if we begin to have difficulty returning to it, of finding our meaning once more. It is a result of the cacophony of sound within our existence that we lose track of the meaning in our lives. A consistency of motion, a repetition of actions within the chaotic experience of existence, feels reminiscent of this stillness, but it is not stillness. This repetitive predictability in a chaotic existence is a feeling of fluidity, rather than the experience of fluidity itself. For all systems in existence, finding rhythm is their closest experience of stillness. For humans, our.ability to contemplate beyond the confines of existential reality, through awareness, is what allows us to unveil the quietude of stillness. The once laborious constancy of noise whose shadow obscured our existence, may only alleviated when we find the rhythm of stillness beyond our existential experience.

1702996101.0,"James Burke's Connections, and and Existentialist Critique of the Supercomputer Fantasy","I was a huge fan of the *Connections* TV show in the 70s, wherein host James Burke demolished the linear view of progress and explained how innovation depended on interconnections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. As Jennifer Oullette on the [ArsTechnica blog](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/fans-of-connections-rejoice-rebooted-classic-sci-doc-series-returns-with-original-host/) explains:

>\[E\]ach episode would start with some past innovation or event—the invention of the cannon and subsequent changes to castle fortifications to eliminate blind spots, for example. Then Burke would spend the remainder of the episode tracking a path through a series of seemingly unrelated events—maps, limelight, incandescent bulbs, substituting guncotton for ivory in billiard balls, the zoopraxiscope, the telegraph—to demonstrate how they all connected to produce a modern-day breakthrough: the movie projector. 

As an existentialist, I found this focus on progress not as an inexorable algorithmic process but as a contingent operation that depended on the input of countless historically and culturally embedded human agents—none of whom necessarily expected their effort to result in the ""end product""—to be a much more realistic way of conceptualizing change.

This made it all the more disappointing when I watched the first episode of the recent reboot of *Connections* and heard Burke immediately hold forth on how a supercomputer, loaded with data, will be able to predict the future even down to details like the clothes you chose to wear this morning. I'm sorry I don't have a transcript of the episode, but it's a common enough trope in science-fan discourse: with enough data, a supercomputer could predict the future.

Am I the only one who sees this as the kind of machine fantasy that Burke's thesis itself refutes? I thought the whole point of Burke's reverse-engineering of a momentous innovation was to demonstrate how many conceptual, methodological and technological precursors had to be in place before the innovation could exist. If the facts of history had been just a little different, we have every right to conclude that either the innovation would never have happened or it might be radically different than the way it turned out.

The supercomputer fantasy plays into the Dream of Reason that the existentialists found so monstrously unconvincing during the rapid technological progress of the 20th century. It makes *quantity* the magic ingredient in producing the oracular ability that ancient humans found such a tantalizing mystical goal: *enough* data points loaded into a device with *enough* processing power will give us access to the eternal and unchanging Truth about ourselves and our universe.

The problem is that data alone don't arrange, emphasize and interpret themselves. The irony for the Greeks about oracular pronouncements was that knowing details about the future won't prevent humans from making mistakes anyway; the Oracle at Delphi regularly dispensed wisdom about the future that inspired folly and led to disaster for the people who received it. Burke's entire career is founded on his ability to describe how fortuitous and exceptional events have momentous and unforeseen consequences. The Holy Grail of complete knowledge through data processing should inspire skepticism rather than confidence.",1

1702777205.0,"I feel alienated from this world and from any person. It makes me feel really lonely. Nothing is worth an investment, as we all will return to dust.","Well, from any person except my family to be honest. 

I just don't fucking care about anyone. I've got ""friends"", but at least from my POV these are fake friendships because I could drop them in an instant. Heck, I even forget to actively stay in contact with them and it's them always messaging me. 

I also don't feel interested in anything really in this world. I don't have a career wish or perspective. Currently I'm doing my PhD and the most bearable option for me is to somehow stay in academia. But I am definitely not doing my PhD because it's what I wanna do. 

Literally nothing and no one interests me. I don't have any hobbies (except sleeping and YouTube), I am not interested in people, and I also don't feel any romantic or sexual interests (I am an aromantic asexual - my testosterone is fine, I've got it tested). 

I honestly don't know if this falls under the category of being schizoid. It's at least the closest thing I've found which matches me. Either this, or I am just very depressed.

Now the question: Why does nothing and no one interests me at all? The answer: Because I don't know, whether there is an afterlife. If there is no afterlife at all, then nothing matters and I can try to watch YouTube all day long until I die. If reincarnation is true, then this life somehow matters but I'm still going to be upset as I won't meet all the people I've met so far again. If heaven is real, then it's the best option: I'm gonna meet people again and I'd be able to look back at a cool life.

But of course we don't know what will come afterwards and it's ultimately a matter of personal faith. 

So why should I make friends and get into relationships if we all will die alone eventually? Why should I try to use my talents and make a career/something out of my life if we all will return to dust?

Right now, I have to literally force myself to do anything for my PhD. Reading an e-mail, reading a chapter in a book feels like forcing oneself to puke. Like it's possible, but it's physically unpleasant. 

At these times, I really envy religious people, especially those born again Christians. 

tl;dr: So basically I got to a point in life where nothing is worth my time: Neither friendships, neither relationships, neither career. As long as I'd be able to somehow survive (i.e. somehow make money, eat, sleep, watch YouTube), it's fine, and it can last for the next 75 years until I'm 100. For me, life is just waiting for death. If there is no afterlife, nothing is worth the investment.",1

1702768467.0,The odds are that we’re living in a dead memory,"I just watched a video in which someone was talking how we are in this very moment living in a most likely forgotten memory: Many (mundane) things we do are things we never again think about or can recall, what you’re now doing is probably one of that! Everything we are currently doing is from this perspective just a mental phenomenon even though it is right now a real subjective experience. This is fascinating because one reason for things we think or do alone (or even with people since we can apply this idea to their situation as well) demonstrably existing is our experience and memory of it.
At the same time what we remember is so biased, flawed and edited through repetitive recall that it’s almost a totally different thing. Is/will our experience then just be non-existing or a mental phenomenon? Of course you can also argue that our experience is/creates something that allocates space and time which therefore exists and will exist regardless of our view of it. I’m not trying to make a philosophical argument here but i’m interested in hearing concepts relating to this and your take on it.

Edit: Putting it differently: Memories and momentary experience are of course very different things conceptually. Momentary experience is a subjective feeling that is however from any other point in the timeline something inaccessible, something forgotten. We have a single current moment but we have had innumerable moments that were forgotten, and looking *from any other point in time* our current moment is one of those forgotten moments.",1

An Optical Illusion for the Soul

What do we trust?

Our senses can be deceived. Optical illusions shatter what we put our faith in oh so dearly. Sounds can be skewed to sound like different words. Intentions can be misidentified and warped with our natural human lenses. 

Is the soul the final space? Is the spirit within us the rock that everything is based upon? 

Why does nobody ask the question “What’s above the soul?”. Why have I never heard that question asked?

There is debate of beginning and end, but no debate of depth. Our senses seem fickle—in fact scientifically *every one of our senses transmits data that has already happened in the past by the time it gets converted in our brain.* Even just for a millionth of a second, it has technically occurred in the past already.

And we know our senses can be deceived—even in the soberest of people.

So we rely on the spirit to ground.

But is it possible that the spirit can be tricked as well?",1

Also pardon me for my poor English if you notice a mistake. I'm not a native English speaker and I only use English in text, not in speaking.


[How I arrived here:]

Since primary school (I think I was 7-9 yrs old at that time), I had these obscure thoughts alienating myself from the world around me. 

I asked myself questions like: ""Why do I see the world in first person?"", ""How do other peope view the world?"", ""Why my viewpoint of the world is limited by my body?"" and then ""Who really am I?""

At some point, I began looking at things weirdly. I noticed that the more I look at something, the more it becomes alien to me. What was once familiar, is becoming something that genuinely scares me. The feeling of the unknown and being insignificant to it.

All of this thoughts was stopped by my First Catholic communion. Heavily indoctrinated, my mind was occupied with god related things onwards.

Fast forward, now an agnostic 19yrs old (I wholeheartedly thanks Nietzsche for that), after comprehending some existentialism philosophy, I began to assess what's truly meaningful to me and what should I do to take responsibility for it.

[Realization of my own meanings and the responsibilities to keep it.]

I will make this short since It's impossible write all of my meanings here.

…

1 month ago, I walked early in the morning. While slowy walking across the streets, I appreciated the warm sunlight and the mundane serenity of the streets. It gave me simple happiness. 

And then came the realization: ""So this too is part of my meaning..."" but then, suddenly asked myself: ""Is happiness really that easy?""

After asking those questions to myself, I realized a problem. I have no full control of my own meanings. Why? It's because I'm afraid to wake up early everytime in the morning! 

Yes, I'm not talking responsibility for my newly realized meaning! It's still my meaning but it will only exist in my memories unless experienced again. Maybe accepting that I have no full control of my own meanings is taking responsibility?

verb

""it doesn't matter what the guests wear""


When people ask the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" I always wonder if they understand the question they’re asking. Life is different for everyone, so you wouldn't think there would be one definitive and universal meaning for every single life. Perhaps what they mean to ask is not ""what is the meaning of life?"" but rather ""why is life?"" or ""what are we supposed to be doing?"" People don't ask these questions directly though because they don't like the answers.
	 The answer to ""what are we supposed to be doing?"" has to be decided by every individual on their own.  The answer to ""why are we here?"" is that when the big bang happened some sludge with proteins in it collided with some water and they then mixed together to create some very simplistic form of DNA and that DNA was then read by another type of protein conjunction called RNA and Then RNA was then read itself by another protein jumble called ribosomes. The ribosomes then followed the instructions written on said RNA and created life. 
But this is a tangent. 
Returning to the initial question of what is the meaning of life? To understand this question let's deconstruct the word meaning, meaning is the word we use when we want to say one thing indicates another. For example, the word paraphernalia's meaning is ""objects that are used to do something or tools used for a job or a hobby"".  For instance, a d20 is dnd paraphernalia. Another example of meaning would be the lesson of the fable “The Tortoise and the Hare.” The meaning of said lesson is that: Taking your time to do something well rather than rushing through it will give you a superior result, so the purpose of the story is to give you a lesson and the lesson has a meaning.
You may realize that these two examples of meaning have something in common: they're both made by conscious beings and they both only make sense in the context of a society. Both the word paraphernalia and the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare were authored by people who live in a society and because of that, they were created for other people living in the same society that they were. The word paraphernalia would not mean anything to a species that never developed tools and the story of the tortoise and the hare wouldn't mean anything to people who never try to accomplish things and sit around all day, these things mean something to us because of the context of our society. But even though the creation of life was without context or purpose it's not the case that where we went from there was without meaning because once consciousness was brought into the picture then meaning could be imposed onto existence. So the answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" is ""the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death."" or at least that's what Google says though as conscious beings that is not the question we should be asking instead we should ask ""what does my life mean?"" What are you trying to tell society and the world with the little time you have alive?",1

1702533547.0,this strange little planet in the middle of nowhere is generating conscious experiences,"So I have no idea if this is existentialist or not. Reddit keeps pushing this sub in my feed. Hello everyone.

I can't stop thinking about this. Everything we experience - indeed, experience itself - seems to be completely anomalous in the universe. We are little pieces of the crust of this planet, temporarily animated by a runaway evolutionary process. This strange little world just grew us on accident. Nothing about this is usual.

The universe doesn't know we are here. It doesn't understand anyone is looking at it. We are its voyeurs.

I think a lot about our five senses. You never really experience *people*. Your own soul or the souls of your friends or family. Everything you see, hear, feel, taste or smell is a piece universe. Even your inner monologue, your emotions and impulses, follow pretty clearly from your animal structure, pounded into this shape by millions of years of evolution. Our consciousness was never a clean slate; it has always been a very idiosyncratic thing, peculiar to this environment and the kind of creatures we happen to be.

I think as individuals we only barely exist. We are little sparks of animal intelligence, firing off in the darkness and then gone in a flash. What we have discovered - and this I think is incredibly profound - is that *this* exists. This vast place. We may be the first to realize this. At least the first within earshot.

There is no natural order. There is no way any of this is *supposed* to go. None of it is planned.

And that is just incredibly startling.",1

Now I think all of this was the case because I was depressed and even suicidal at times for a long time of my life (10+ years)
Now I am in my late 20s and have finally had a lot of experiences which people usually go through earlier in life and my life is finally unstuck and progressing, I am getting absolutely terrified of death.

I get these periods where I become hyperaware of my consciousness and fleeting existence and I cannot cope with it. The more I think about it the more primitive I see myself: a bunch of molecules which simply respond to stimuli producing thought, some of it becoming more fixed and habitual forging an identity to deal with it's own awareness.
Just a fleeting process, one piece of a puzzle formed by the laws of physics and elements of the universe.

I have long lost the hope for any answers, as there are none. I can't even form definite opinions on most things, I strongly believed I should figure out some topics before I could fully live. My family and I strongly disagree on some things and I just don't give a fuck anymore. I don't try to argue or put much effort into figuring out answers, as it seems quite pointless. I don't have much time and I think it would be more productive to spend it on other things. Now I just believe I should strongly figure out how to best do certain mundane things, so I can best teach my future child.

If all goes well I am nearly 1/3d through life and it is only going to get faster. It is really incredibly short and I know that all that is important is right now and I am enjoying it, even seeing the process as the important thing instead of just the eventual results, like graduating and stuff like that.

But I have so much anxiety thinking about how short it is and... Meaningless in the end. Like I have a partner now who I know I want to be with until death, but in my mind it is already nearly there when I think about it and it keeps me up at night. It's even harder to think about how my dad also has death anxiety and he is much closer to death than I am, he even had a near death experience once before.
I don't know what to do and I guess I'm looking for some comradery or some helpful ways to think about things.

Edit: I think what is stressing me a lot is the awareness of self compared to others, the fundamental experience of being your own being, which is unexplainable(?) If someone could offer thoughts on this specifically, that would be appreciated. ",1
1702492923.0,Why has the world become so miserable with the modern way of work?,"I understand that life is kinda shitty for most and it is what it is.

Like the modern world has probably lower crimes and more ways to protect the rights of people than it had in the past. 

But, isn’t the modern way of work and lifestyle is kinda responsible for it in some or the other cases of misery?

Like imagine, physics, math, music, paintings, writing, or take the most forms of arts and sciences: in the earlier generations, it used to be done or is represented in the most genuine and heartfelt and desirable manner. 

Even though there are more researches done than in the past, but most of it is to just consume the work for some kinda profits in terms of consumerism or corporate profits or materialistic satisfaction or some kinda greed. Not everyone, but it is kinda obvious in many instances.

Even till the early 20th century, many people were doing it for the love of subject. But these days, it has become so much about status and profit for any and every research field. Like all the values of loving the subject is gone out of the box.

Like I’ve seen students being shoved with so much of studies without making them understand or comprehend the essence of subjects. They just study go to college get out with good or bad grades and just fall into the trap of corporates that they don’t get the time to even think how and what they’re doing. Even in the very little time they get off of work, the materialistic or the crap of some holistic modern day bullshit takes over their head to escape whatever misery or dread they go through the work.


Like all the advertisements social media s movies and tvs and everywhere it is just constant shoving of things which are so obviously out there to make people paint the miserable word with some shitty delusional crap. 


I don’t know if I’m even making any sense right now, but shit is worse. 
I understand that as the days go by we need to learn more and more to stay competent and sustain in the word, but why has it gone that way? Why has everything just being dragged mercilessly by the materialistic greed profit seeking spineless cowards?

1702434717.0,"Irrational Man, A Study in Existential Philosophy - William Barrett","I was really impressed by a recent rereading of William Barrett's *Irrational Man*. We need to be reminded that there are many constructs and institutions that only exist to dehumanize us and dismiss our experience of Being as illusion or wishful thinking. His thesis is just as powerful and relevant today as in the 1950s:

""Existentialism is the counter-Enlightenment come at last to philosophic expression; and it demonstrates beyond anything else that the ideology of the Enlightenment is thin, abstract, and therefore dangerous. (I say its ""ideology,"" for the practical task of the Enlightenment is still with us: In everyday life we must continue to be critics of a social order that is still based everywhere on oppression, injustice, and even savagery—such being the peculiar tension of mind that we as responsible human beings have to maintain today.) The finitude of man, as established by Heidegger, is perhaps the death blow to the ideology of the Enlightenment, for to recognize this finitude is to acknowledge that man will always exist in untruth as well as truth. Utopians who still look forward to a future when all shadows will be dispersed and mankind will dwell in a resplendent Crystal Palace will find this recognition disheartening. But on second thought , it may not be such a bad thing to free ourselves once and for all from the worship of the idol of progress; for utopianism—whether the brand of Marx or of Nietzsche—by locating the meaning of man in the future leaves human beings here and now, as well as all mankind up to this point, without their own meaning. If man is to be given meaning the Existentialists have shown us, it must be here and now; and to think this insight through is to recast the whole tradition of Western thought. The realization that all human truth must not only shine against an enveloping darkness, but that such truth is even shot through with its own darkness may be depressing, and not only to utopians. But it has the virtue of restoring to man his sense of the primal mystery surrounding all things, a sense of mystery from which the glittering world of his technology estranges him, but without which he is not truly human.""

When the Existentialists were first crawling out of the rubble of our world wars, it couldn't have been more clear that the legacy of the Enlightenment was a vast apparatus of exploitation, control, slaughter and domination. What that means is that the abstract, artificial Reason that rationalized slaughter and domination is as far from the truths of human experience as you can get. If you're still committed to the Dream of Reason and the nostalgia for progress, I have no idea what appeals to you about the Existentialists.

The darkness that Barrett is talking about here isn't the epistemic horizon that is constantly being pushed back by scientific progress. It's something in humans and human society that can't be rationally understood, the core of Being. Society has constructed unwieldy control systems like religion and science to try to either make it useful or explain it away, but it's an abiding problem for humanity: what does human existence mean? The Existentialists say that the first step toward answering this isn't studying Scripture or mapping the human genome, it's the individual living authentically.

The Enlightenment program led to the Industrial Revolution and the juggernaut of colonialism and exploitation that went along with it. The Holocaust was a grotesque demonstration of the horrors of technological efficiency; the shadows on the Hiroshima walls were the result of the way the Reason Machine looked at ineffable human experience as irrelevant next to the glories of scientific progress.

The existentialists weren't fond of rose-colored glasses.

Basically when I was a kid I remember waking up the first time and asking my self who am I, I didn’t know my family like if they were strangers. Since little I feel presence and I’m able to feel people’s energy and I’m really good at identifying patterns. Since kid I try seeking for answers of why I feel those presence because I started having sleep paralysis, I took anti psychotic pills and all sort of medication and it never went away until an old friend of mine the use to tell me that she use to feel energy and said the my energy was super strong, she told me about meditation and something weird happen when I try it the first time,I got up from the position I was meditating and began going outside. I saw a guy holding what it looks like a sword and he was glowing like a white/yellow color. We started speaking in another language And I was able to understand than I went into a vortex and wake up in a sleep paralysis, once I was out of the sleep paralysis I want to go back meditating because I was curious what just happen, than when I started meditating I open my eyes and there was bunny and bird going all over me in the bed, and than I saw a women what it looks like a trumpet and started speaking to me in the language. when we finish talking she put a finger in my head and I went to a vortex again, and when I wake up I was again in the sleep paralysis but this time I was able to move the first thing the went to my head was punching the “demon” and he did a little noise and went to the closet. When I open my eyes I found the door open and I check the cameras and I check the footage of when I was meditating and it was green, I wasn’t able to see what happen but since I guess I’ve been waking up and now. My life took a turn that I have never thought would happen. I still feel the presence but I understand now that is just I can feel my energy. btw I try suicide 5 times and every time I feel pain in the heart I fall of sleep and wake up the next day like nothing happen, like if I didn’t took a entire bottle of buspirone

But Nietzsche takes this a step further, his idea is that the universe is structured in such a way that everything about it, and everything in it expresses a will to power.

He uses the idea of an elemental organism that keeps eating and eating until it can no longer sustain its own size.

The idea that I am the only conscious perspective that exists. That other people might be there as appearances but not as conscious perspectives like I am. I want to clarify that I am not a solipsist. I don't believe it. I am just scared of it. A lot.

Whenever I dig into existential questions about free will, existence, consciousness, why everything is the way it is etc. I always end up seeing comments like ""They are all you. It is all you. Only you"". Or things like ""You are the only thing that exists. Everything else is your imagination."" Oftentimes upvoted multiple times.

This freaks me out because I don't understand why people would say that. The only reason I would ever say something like this is to gaslight or troll someone. For no other reason. And it is hard for me to believe that all the people I see writing this are doing this with malicious intentions. Because they are not saying it from their perspective ""I am all that exists."" They are saying it about me.

To me this is unexplainable. And it scares me because it seems like a nightmare where my imagination is telling me to wake up. Why would anyone ever claim that they themselves do not exist to tell me that I am everything? Does anyone have an explanation?

I may be very well just driving myself insane but what leads me to this question is how every day follows the same dynamic of we wake up, eat, socialize, follow our individual routines, every now and then a major event or news happen in our society but nothing to the scale I mentioned.

At the same time the more I think about it, I realize this concept of “ordinary” only exists in my own illusion of reality because I exist in this very moment as a conscious being in an incomprehensible universe which quite literally not a single one of us knows exactly why or what’s going on. Any way I look at it whether the explanation of existence comes through religion or science in the end it does not give a satisfactory answer to the question of reality.

Following popular Abrahamic religions the explanation is that there is one God who created us and don’t get me wrong I definitely believe in a higher power, it just doesn’t make sense to me to believe we are simply here by chance as some non-religious people believe. Now if we take a different approach and look at the also popular Big Bang theory at some point in time the atoms and elements became conscious? And I love science because it tries to explain and understand how our universe works but I often find people grow arrogant and believe these theories to be the definitive “truth” but true scholars are aware of the incredible amount of things we do not know.

Migraines (had them but I think it triggered more),
Fear of going crazy,
Couldnt believe myself,
Dreamy vision thought im dreaming,
Dreams being more real than reality itself.
Memory issues (biggest one couldnt know if I did something or not),
Heart Palpitations,
Fear of schizophrenia,
Fear of dementia,
Fear if im not breathing,
Had no emotions at all,
Couldnt cry,
Fear of myself looking on the mirror,
Feeling that i lost myself when i watched my old photos,
Not recognizing family members and wife (that was the worst thing),
Waking up one day and realizing that u wont recognize anyone in the world not even urself.


Everything listed here were my symptoms. Went to my psychologist and she told me that ur in a somatic moment.
My cardiologist told me ur heart is totally fine,
My ophtamologist told me that yout vision is clear and u have no problems,
My neurologist told me that theres nothing wrong with u.

every symptom that I had now they all are gone, Or even if i feel soemthing its only the shaky hands or feets sometimes its a heat flush that I get or sometimes my stomach feels like having butterflies. I started feeling joy and happiness started gettning better, i can now talk to strangers, i can be myself, i can eat whatever i want and i feel myself grounded hopefully but there's something still haning out with me.

The FEAR OF BEING IN A DREAM or should i say False awakening, it happened a month ago and I was thinking that I wake up and i sit on my PC but no, i was in my bed and I went nuts and the anxiety just locked my entire body, and the second time it happened was when i was woth my psychologist and out of nowehere while she was talking my mind just told me ""wait ur in a dream"" and I just locked and felt so bad and forgot like everything i talked with my psychologisit, she told me yes it happens because u just were constantly mentioning and it came :) but I was ok after but when that happens my happines just goes down and I feel depressed after. Sometimes while doing something my brain tries to recall every fucking thing like what happened 10 sec ago and I try to recall it and that makes me sick because I know not everything should be remembered like that, otherwise i remember things clearly from the past and have no problems about it not even today but sometimes recalling something or trying to remember anything related to a task was a struggle cuz I couldnt remember anything what someone said before, it made me feel that I am stupid ina  way and my IQ went down or someshit that was the biggest fear.

I have no one in my family that has/had any schizophrenia, dementia or anything else.

I Think im on my way recovering like 80% maybe even 90% but Im afraid of being happy now because I sense that the feeling of being in a dream will destroy my happiness again and again :(.

I live a happy life, i work a lot but now my doctors told me to reduce stress cuz thats the main reason of feeling like this. And i reduced work in the matter that IM working but not gicing stress to myself like omg why i didnt finish this thing.

I would like to know ur stories about this, and I would really appreciate everyeones time on this. Im feeling better im totally betetr than i was in the 1 month ago even better a week ago.

I think I still fear from what I experienced and its all in my mind but im trying to get out of this :)

I pray for everyone of u and It will go away trust me I had so many symptoms that I didnt even know what to do but here I am now.

Thanks",1

1701928907.0,How do I choose the meaning of my life? How do I live the best life? [Intractability],"Sure, life has no inherent meaning. Sure, we give our life meaning by choosing what we want our life to be about, and there are certain well known heuristics, e.g. [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/COOX6mecXW)

This is misdirection. The human brain is a simple optimizer that demands model to optimize, and the actual question people are asking is ""how do I live a well-lived life?"" ""What model of life can I find so that things start to make sense and I can move ahead?"" 

You may say, well, existentially, there is no solution. That's not true. At some point, someone may be able to weigh their life and say ""I figured out how to live my life and it went just about as well as I could ask. I didn't mess up any key decisions.""

In any event it doesn't much matter, you are required to make decisions.

It's like chess, a general perfect decision making model of chess is impossible, but if you won chess it's easy to check.

You may then say ""well, just like chess, making a perfect model is impossible."" Sure, but imperfect models aren't impossible, and in fact we do it for chess. The way we approach life is very similar to how we build decision making models for chess.

1) in the short term, we step things ahead a few moves and see if we get to a better position
2) for the long term, we make moves based on guesses and ""feelings,"" and you may say 'no it's not a feeling' and I would say, yes it is. AlphaZero is a model-free approach which means it has no idea what is going on, it just feels like it's closer to a victory state.

You may say, 'well we make decisions every day, what's the problem?'

I'll give some examples from my life:

""I have a PhD, but many other PhDs end up unhappy in cubicles. Should I be a creative? Do I want to try and start my own company? What if I work 80 hours a week and make millions, would that be good? Billionaires seem to like it. Is Elon Musk happy? What if the right answer is just to raise kids and it doesn't matter? What mindset should I have here?""

""I have a fun but kind of messed up love interest. Do I turn it down because I can most likely find someone I'll like more? How does that make sense though, perpetually searching for a perfect partner, shouldn't I just make the best with what I have and move forward? What mindset should I have here?""

""Should I cure cancer, join the government, get my name in textbooks or what? What mindset should I have here?""

""Does morality actually matter or is it just the frontal lobe sweet-talking our limbic system? What mindset should I have here?""

I don't know if I am really conveying the idea. These questions are dependent on my understanding of the purpose of my life. Despite this, life is beyond the ability to start to solve the slightest sense of it, it is unsolvable or 'intractable.' More to the point, the goal of life is itself intractable. For a decade I have wished I could clone myself at every key decision and take both paths, but I am alone at every doorway.

Is this where everyone ends up? Is there nothing but broken and poorly applicable heuristics to jam into my life, fully aware that they are no closer to the truth than anything else? I'm legitimately, not rhetorically asking, because as I see it, the following path is inevitable:

(1) There is no purpose because there is no real meaning in life.

(2) You automatically act according to some facade of a real purpose based on a heuristic

(3) The heuristic is incomplete, and either screws you (hedonism is fun until your partner leaves you for cheating) or can't be applied well (ok cool I want to be known throughout time for my works, how do I get started?) and you realize you need to adjust your heuristics closer to the truth

(4) you attempt to understand the nature of your life, and are unable to grasp major aspects of critical pieces

(5) you convince yourself you've gained some insight and adjust your decision-making heuristic

(6) you repeat 2-5 until 7

(7) you give up and convince yourself you made it, in a fate similar to Winston at the end of 1984. You put on some tinted glasses that convince you that the void is colored a lovely shade of some ideology, say singulitarian. You begin trying to help immortality research. You laugh at people who have different colored glasses on.

Conclusion and TL;Dr: Is there no way to make decisions in your life besides complicated forms of pure guessing? On the microscopic level, it seems easy. In any other perspective, it seems impossible (intractable) to even make progress, unless you lie to yourself to simply things incorrectly",1
1701915442.0,Free Will,"Can someone explain to me why they think there is free will? I barely see anything logical about it.

Let's start off by examining how free will would work. In my opinion, free will would operate in a world where the future is completely unknown, which our future isn't, due to the butterfly effect. We all know that we can calculate and predict things, and the precision is determined by the amount of information we have. Imagine there is a hypothetical being that freezes time and possesses all of the information in the universe – and by all of it, I mean completely all of it. The being can calculate everything and anything into the future, leaving our future at a 100% chance of happening in a certain way. It's important because if there is only one outcome possible for the whole universe, then an individual doesn't have free will.

I believe our world is made up of massive interconnected energy/ies. I got this from Tesla's numbers theory and the apple in the sealed box theory. What's in the box will go through every single possible way the energy there can change places and transform, etc. Basically, that is our universe in a big never-ending box with energy interchanging possibly forever. Essentially, the energy is like numbers – 1+1=2 – and you get something different from adding one thing. Our universe can expand and interchange from how many 1s there are before going back to the starting state, as in the apple in the box theory. That only can't happen if there is an infinite amount of energy, for it would be changing forever forward.

We're basically the same as everything but also different. Like us, the tiny portion of our universe doesn't have free will like we think. It's just a construct; it isn't really real. Instead, there is a process of thought that happens from the will of the interconnected energy. It is funny how one piece of the universe can look at another and think it's, for example, dumb.

The only way I see there being free will is if somebody is controlling our bodies without us or our bodies knowing it. But it doesn't make sense because then it would still mean that, in this world, there is no free will, and our minds operate in this world.

I can't think of one logical way for there to be free will that doesn't require a massive leap of faith. Can anyone inspire me?",1
1701892597.0,Losing My Mind Over Many Worlds Theory. Is there any way out?,"Hello everyone,

Posted this in [r/AskPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/) and [r/QuantumPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumPhysics/). They told me that this is more of a philosophical than a physical question. So I post it here now.

I  am going crazy because of Quantum Physics. According to my limited  understanding of quantum mechanics there are theories out there that  state that in our ""reality"" every possible branch that could exist  actually exists. Of course this is meant on a particle level but with  enough branching it would also translate into our daily life.

If  that is true, would that not mean that there is absolutely no reality  to anything? My girlfriend or mother have no character. I just happen to  be in a universe or reality where they behave in a certain way. They  are not actually in any way. There is an infinite number of realities  where they are slightly different or completely different. Nothing at  all is in any sense ""real"". It is just a version that I happen to land  in. Same goes for myself. I am just whatever randomly happens. Why would  I even care about anything then? Why would I try to help people? Why  achieve anything? There are realities in which it happens and those in  which it doesn't. Also, there are realities in which people are tortured  in eternity.

What's scaring me even more is communities like [r/NevilleGoddard](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/),  where people use this ""knowledge"" to shift realities based on their  desires. They have this idea of EIYPO (everything is you pushed out) and  that our assumptions about reality cause us to jump between the  possibilities of the wave function. Meaning that when I deeply assume a  behavior of my girlfriend, mother, friend etc. I will end up in a branch  where this actually happens. And if that is true, who are other people  even? Are they even conscious entities or am I just jumping as the only  solipsistic perspective between branches.I know this probably sounds  stupid to you. But this is freaking me out. I am in therapy already  because of this. It is horrible. I don't need any definitive proof  against it (as I know it probably does not exist). But do you have any  insight into this, that can put this into perspective? Is the theory  stupid? Is my interpretation wrong? Is it correct but I am viewing it  from a bad angle?

TL;DR: The idea  that everything that can exist does exist, causes me intense feelings of  panic and terror. I don't see any point in living if no action makes a  difference, since all outcomes exist anyways. And very very horrible  realities (eternal torture) also exist. Is there a way to escape this  perspective?",1

1701870726.0,A thought experiment for y'all,"***First part***

Imagine that in - let's say - 30 years from now, our capitalistic society gets so individualistic to the extent it cannot function properly anymore. Or maybe there is a big natural disaster that destroys the societal structures as we know them today and we need to build everything from scratch again.

A tech company allies with the state in order to implant little ""compassion chips"" in our brains, which make us more empathetic and altruistic towards others. They are only meant for utilitarian reasons.

Here's how the compassion chip works: every time you do a good action, you get a big rush of dopamine/endorphins. You start to associate being a good person with pleasure ; in other words, you become addicted to doing good things. It doesn't mean that you feel the urge to do it because it feels morally right, but because **you** ***become*** **addicted to the feeling of euphoria/pleasure it gives you**.

**Would these people still be considered moral, even if they do the right thing (e.g. saving someone from drowning) only because it gives them a rush of pleasure?**

***Second part***

Now, imagine you were one of those people whose brain chemistry has been altered by a ""compassion chip"": one day, you wake up and realize that the functioning of the chip has been **reversed** (we don't know whether it's an error or whether someone changed it intentionally). You realize that you can only feel a rush of dopamine/endorphins by hurting others and doing morally reprehensible things. Not only that, but it even physically hurts to be a good person. It feels like pure hell. Imagine the worst kind of pain you could inflict on another human being without killing him - and that's it.

The more significant your help is, the more severe your pain becomes (e.g. saving a child from drowning is much more painful than just holding the door for an old lady, for instance).

**How much time will you manage to remain a good person in these conditions? Do you think you could continue doing the ""right"" thing while constantly being severely punished for it by your internal brain chemistry?**

1701828364.0,"Would would Kierkegaard have to say about George Bush saying ""God told me to invade Iraq?""","I am writing an essay on existentialist themes and how they relate to modern day socio-political problems in the world. My understanding of Kierkegaard is that Abraham suspends himself from the ethical norm of ""murder is wrong"" in order to sacrifice his son to God. He cannot rationally explain his decision but he remains within his faith and transcends to the status of the ""knight of faith"" because of it. His being remains a paradox because he embraces the infinite God while remaining within temporally grounded. However, it is because of this that Abraham lives an authentic life.

1701817790.0,"My attempt at ""disproving"" solipsism.","Obviously solipsism is an infinite theory that cannot be disproved, no matter how many arguments you make against it, someone will come up and add more to the specific possibility of it. But regardless, here's my attempt.  


Lets look at this from the basics. First of all, I know I exist. Like Descartes said, ""I think, therefore I am."" But how do I know that others exist? What if everyone is just a figment of my imagination?   


Well, we don't know anything, for one. I could be secretly Kanye West under my skin and you wouldnt know unless you skinned me. Which you won't do, because what if I'm not actually Kanye under my skin and I just lied? The same applies to solipsism. You're not gonna run into a grocery store naked and screaming, because what if solipsism isnt true and everyone is just as real as you are? There you go, you don't actually believe in solipsism. That's a good thing to get out of the way first.  


Second, if I'm truly the only person and I created this existence for myself, why am I not a billionaire with gold cars and toilets and women at my service 24/7? Why would I give myself such a boring, basic life where I'm purely just unknown and random to the world? And why can I not control reality, like why can't I just make my crush like me or destroy that building with my mind? If I truly created this world for myself, it doesn't make sense for me to have given myself such a basic and pathetic life. And someone might argue that another God placed me here with fake people, well that alone debunks solipsism because therefore I am not truly alone.  


Third, why do I have such limited understanding of the world? I still don't understand 9th grade algebra. I still dont understand the creation of the universe. I still dont understand conciousness. And theres plenty of smaller things I don't understand, like how touch screens work or how recording works. If I created all of those things, then I think I would be at least somewhat capable of understanding it. But i'm not. And if I was truly some almighty creator who placed myself in a normal life, then I would understand it.  


Fourth, I can make an idea, and then give it to others, and that idea can be improved. That also proves that theres something or someone participating in this reality with me that is capable of improving my ideas. And I can also ask someone to feed me random numbers, and that also proves that people are somewhat capable of thinking things on their own. If you guessed their numbers before they said them, then it would be more plausible. Same thing also goes for math problems, if someone stumps you with a math problem they gave you then they are capable of thinking, and therefore, they are.

1701816085.0,Is it true you are halfway through life when you turn 18?,"I recently came across a paper that said that if you live for 100 years, you will be halfway through your “perceived” lifetime by age 18.

1701812809.0,I don’t know what to believe anymore,"I just want some like minded folks to talk about this with.

Lately, life events have just made me question everything. The more people I talk to, and the more perspectives I learn and understand, the less I feel like there’s any fundamental truth to anything. And the more I learn about philosophy to try and make sense of things, the more I feel like ultimately nothing makes sense.

It’s hard to even articulate how deep it goes in my head. 

I’d describe myself as being somewhat of a spiritual person. But lately it feels harder to believe in that. I’ve met so many people who told me their struggles and experiences with immense suffering. The senseless type of suffering, such as spouses and innocent children dying of cancer. The occurrence of these things alone makes me think that there can’t be a fundamental goal or higher power in the universe, lest the fundamental power be largely indifferent to human suffering. I also find it hard to believe that all suffering happens for an ultimate ‘purpose’ set by the universe. Otherwise we’d be able to somehow quantify what that purpose is. A lot of the world’s suffering honestly just feels senseless. 

This has also led me down the path of questioning other things such as ethics, morals, right and wrong, etc.. And the more I think about these principles, the more I feel like they don’t objectively exist. We make them all up, and basically govern by popular majority of belief. 

Like morals for example. A lot of moral issues have no clear right or wrong. Hot button political topics are notorious for this. The more I learn about either side of any debate, the more it becomes clear that there just isn’t a morally correct answer. Sure I can pick a side on these things, which I naturally do, but I also recognize that my opinion is largely based on my own limited perspective and is far from being the ultimate morally correct opinion. 

This applies to any framework which we humans collectively attempt to agree on. Like what is a good person? What is a bad person? I used to think an objective truth to that fundamentally existed. But it just doesn’t.

I feel like I’m coming to the conclusion that when you break anything down to its root essence, everything in existence ‘just is’. Sometimes the majority agrees on what is true, but it doesn’t make that thing actually true. Everything just is, and any meaning we assign to something is made up. 

We construct everything to have a meaning so that we can operate in accordance to that meaning. But all roads lead back to the meaning we give things being entirely made up for the purpose of our own survival. 

I feel like I no longer can say which worldviews/ideas/opinions are morally correct.  I feel like I can no longer say which conclusions are most truthful. All I can do is state that which resonates most with my perspective.

How can an objective ethical truth exist if right and wrong is not a fundamental  framework of reality? That is to say, if the universe itself does not abide by ethical principles, then we have no basis to determine any fundamental truth. Any and  all conclusions are constructed by our collective agreements and disagreements. 

At this point, I can’t help but confront the fact that anything I choose to do in this life ultimately doesn’t have a purpose other than the one I give to it, and I recognize that any purpose I choose to give to it is ultimately made up. 

Nothing makes sense, nothing we do means anything, and nothing we place a moral/ethical value on is fundamentally correct. Even to state that nothing is objectively true is a paradox, since that itself now becomes a fundamental truth. To state that nothing is objectively true is to state that nothing being objectively true is in itself an objective truth. Like it just doesn’t make sense. No conception of our existence makes sense.

I’m just curious if anybody else has come to a similar conclusion. I don’t really know what to think anymore, and I can’t make any sense of our existence.",1
1701807374.0,Bruh whaaaaat?,"So, I saw a reel on instagram where a mother is grieving her son, like 2-3yrs old toddler. And it made be think about how pointless life is. The longer you live, the more you grief. All the people you ever loved will die one by one. Who wants that??

1701783615.0,"The Son of Man; February 5, 2022","Why don't I commit suicide? A question that keeps echoing and protesting on my doorsteps. I start my day with an anxiety of an incomplete mind. I do things that I don't know what they're, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, illusion from reality. It's difficult for the mind of this being to comprehend the self and the whole; no, the self and the other—is there an all after all?

Myself mocks me, creates distance between me and my states. What drives me is the barbaric that my species loves to adorn—that energy of life, the will to exist and actualize. The enchantment of triumph that pervades every movement, though we're rarely aware of it. I long for my people, but am I really yearning for my people, or do I miss myself? The echoes  within the realm of my mind don't answer. Did I really have that soul to begin with, or, with some stories, do I molly-coddle myself?

In a darkness of a dictatorial boundary of the self, I find myself thinking in random aimlessness. It begins and ends with me. This is a ruin of a self that toys itself with its outer walls.

And I always ask about the meaningfulness as If the the word has a meaning. Strange letters that have the power to stop my futility, but absurdity is a transcendental entity telling us that there's nothing truly transcendental.

Among words, there are those whose necks have been twisted till they no longer mean anything: will, power, desire, sex, potency, actualization. Isn't language a functional illusion that we live inside and that lives and becomes real with us? But, no, what about this sentence?

If you do, you live. If you stop, you die. Every stop is a medieval woman, except that she's the type who chases death—that lord, that noble of darkness.

The desire to kll the pen and extinguish this paper fire haunts me. It's a fire destined to be extinguished if the pen dies, the arena is destroyed, or if the poem commits suicide and is forgotten. I realize now that this seat itself doesn't leave the description of random aimlessness that I don't know what it's.

Every ""I"" is alone, even if she showed compassion to herself with statues of what's outside. Even if she called them neighbors, even if she wrote about them threats or the idolization of the beloved. Love is an idol worship of what cannot be known. To love is to have power over you. To be loved is to have authority and potency over someone; desire, competition, and revenge. What a power of adornment to what the person has of fear, loneliness, and desire for concealment! We mask it in a product that we shop for in miserable madness. And then there it is, the grand celebration of the celestial; this meaning of life. I apologize, Schopenhauer. The good is not an illusion, but it cannot be relied upon.

I ask about the pronoun ""we"", and I find no answer or thought except for ""I ask about the pronoun 'we' "".

Do as you please of wounds bandages and music. This species has no hope. But before that, does this species even put a positive value to this claimed hope? And really, Is this desired really desirable? Is it really goodness? Thieves of the word goodness are everywhere and every domain.

And why goodness, in any case? Why not evil? And why the two to begin with? I propose a new religion in which we crusify who invented the two, and then we demand from those who used them to ask for forgiveness, and after that, we crusify who invented the word contradiction.

All that is real is this existent becoming. If we crusify the truth, does it remain true? From the misery of the ego to the misery of matter. What's wrong with illusion anyway?

Love is an adornment of a transcendental appearance and a beautiful social mask for what lies within the essence of sex, which is conflict, violence, and power.

As a person, you have an individual identity - for example, I see, hear, feel, smell, taste the things I interact with just as you do with the things that you interact with.  I am uniquely conscious of my life as each person is uniquely conscious of their life.

The question that then arises for me is why is it the case that in all of time, I became conscious personally of this life, with this brain, in this body?  Why not someone in the past or the future or not at all.

Let’s put aside religious views and ideas of soul for a moment.  How do we comprehend the existence of an individual’s unique consciousness and identity.  Yes, we can say that the brain is the source for all senses and consciousness.  But how does that explain why I am actively conscious for this life, body, time and you are separately conscious for your life, body time (and so on and so forth).  Why do *I think, therefore I am*.

In trying to better comprehend this individual person-specific consciousness and identity a second question arises.  Why would it not be possible or conceivable that at some time in the past or future “you” or “me” was, or will be, actively conscious of another body, life, time?  Why am I the conscious thinker of this personal existence?  Why do I think, therefore I am.  And is it possible that at some point in the past or future another being existed or will exist to which I (whatever “I” is) will be the active conscious observer.

If time and the universe are infinite (which are debatable), I would suppose that it would be more likely for multiple conscious experiences.  In my view, this can be the case even if there is no continuity of a unique individual consciousness.  Instead the role of the observer can be achieved multiple times by whatever anatomical characteristics form an individual consciousness.  Whatever those fundamental characteristics are - like how do you resolve that identical twins do not share a consciousness but rather each have a separate, unique individual consciousness observing their life.

Alternatively, one could argue for the theories of a continual consciousness that survives bodily death or a universal consciousness whereby we are all just the means by which the universe observes and experiences itself.  

It all still makes me wonder why me, why now, why this life, as this current observer instead of never being an observer or being the observer at any other time and as any other person.",1

1701695837.0,"Being part of something larger just shifts the problem one step further away, it doesn't solve it.","For many years I had no existential angst or fear of death. I found great joy and  meaning in being a parent as well as belonging to communities and causes larger than myself. This made me feel at ease with death as I knew that these communities and causes would continue beyond my death. And all these endeavours felt so meaningful.

But then it suddenly struck me that this ""belonging to something bigger"" just shifted the ""problem"" of impermanence one (or several) step away from myself. I had this truly brutal epiphany that nothing lasts. Everyone and everything we love will perish one day. Maybe even existance itself as we know it (altough no one can say with any degree of certainty if that is actually the case, despite theories of heat death and similar concepts).

My epiphany caused me great distress. I no longer felt the joy and satisfaction of raising children, working for causes I believe in and just generally trying to be the best version of myself. Psycologically, I used to be one of those people who took great joy in living life in a general pursuit of optimization: optimize your health, optimize your nutrition, optimize your parenting, optimize your training... etc. Suddenly all that just felt like exercises in vanity.

My first reaction to this epiphany was that I wanted to go back, to simply forget this ""insight"" and pick up my old life again. But now it seems more and more unlikely that this will work. So now I am trying to convince myself that maybe this is part of necessary existential maturing on my behalf (I'm rapidly approaching the age of 40).

I'm trying to make sense of my existence in light of this new ""insight"" I had. I'm trying to meditate on the idea that existance and life itself is a beautiful miracle, and that it is a gift to be alive. But as much as I try, that thought is not enough to make me happy or feel satisfied. In fact, I have no idea what it would take to make me happy again. Which sets off an entire chain of thoughts in itself: ""Oh, so is that the meaning of life? That you should be happy? Why?"". In other words, the more I contemplate this issue, the more confusion it seems to bring.

What I do know for a fact is that I do not wish to suffer. And that is enough to provide me with a foundation for my quest in search for meaning. Because if I could find a sense of meaning again, I would no longer suffer.

As for the big question itself, I gravitate more and more towards the idea that the solution lies in exercising the discipline to refrain from thinking about the purpose of existance. To stop questioning if there is any point in pursuing my human desires. To simply be. Because like children are prone to doing, it is easy to keep asking the question ""why?"" into infinity. Furthermore, even talking about a ""solution"" implies there is a question to be asked. It seems to me that no matter how you try to tackle this subject you can not and will never be able to make sense of the meaning of existence or the foundational purpose of anything by means of logical analysis or rational reasoning, deduction etc. I think I should chose to simply accept that I exist and focus more on being and less on meaning. This seems more likely to make for a happy life and even though I can't say that the meaning of life is to be happy I sure know that I WANT to be happy.

It seems to me the more and harder I think about these questions, the more I risk going mad. For example: I find myself even asking what the point is in me feeling a sense of meaning in life. Why is that meaningful? Is it even meaningful? Is the meaning of life dependant on my feelings about it? In the end it seems that this is simply a hole that you can tumble down into that has no bottom as you can always keep questioning even the foundation that your question rests on. In other words: at some point you just have to accept being and stop thinking so hard. And don't ask why.

Has anyone else had similar thoughts to these? How do you handle them?

There seems to be turning points in peoples’ lives—tipping points, as Malcom Gladwell calls them.

They are the points in our lives where everything changes. The direction shifts. The airplane switches over a couple of degrees and will eventually change someone’s arrival from Miami to NYC.

But the problem is, we believe we have the ability to make decisions when it really seems as though we are compelled to do them from some external source.

Do we really have control in this world? Is this place somewhere we actually have a say in? Are we out of some black mirror shit that seems to never end?

If we die would we have a life outside of this life? Are we energy? Have we already died and is this a life that we are playing black again?

Why does it seem that learning feels more like remembering that learning something new?

Why does it seem that there is a spiritual essence behind and backing everything that seems to be occurring?

When will science be able to detect life force and soul? And will we know it is the same thing we have been fantasizing about for millennia now? Or will we cling to our old beliefs of the gods of the past?

Perhaps Alzheimer’s is a microcosm of our existence on an eternal scale. Perhaps we are beings on life support suspended in eternity living as though we cannot remember. And we get glimpses of the eternal but never the full view.

Maybe chaos is our mother.

Is there a purpose? 

Is there an end? Is there a reason?

If time doesn’t exist, is there a need to do anything?

If everything is perfect as it is, why change it? Drive does not have a place in enlightenment.

There are higher levels of enlightenment. Is there a dimension higher than what I perceive with my faculties.

Is it wise to jump dimensions when I haven’t experienced all of this one?

So I’ve been on this journey for 2 years now and I’ve got all these different realisations regarding life, death, being human, what is beyond human reality, God, and stuff like that. 
I’ve accepted some some different philosophies on these. Mostly I believe, or feel, that I am a part of everything, and that everything is part of nothing and for me that is God. I’ve felt that on *all* of my trips, meditations and day to day life and I do believe that. 
But, and here’s the but, that fucks with me, I sometimes feel that I am nothing more than just atoms and molecules arranged in such an order that this arrangement itself, the brain, is the thing that gives me consciousness. And I don’t see God in that. I want to, but I can’t. 
The feeling that I am nothing more, than just a brain in a human meat bag suit gives me bad leves of depersonalization and derealization, but in the end, that is all true. I am a brain in a meatbag suit. 
How do I accept that? How do I find God in that, if that’s just chemistry, biology and nothing more than that? Is that the point? God being God through human biology, chemistry and everything we are discovering in the world about the world, about us?

Nowadays, human are highly educated. They know that country and religion are social construct tools and their main purpose serve to stabilize civilization and they might not be worthy for people to die/work hard for.  At the same time, people are uncertain about so many things that they don't know what to do.

The way I see it, there are 2 pathways in life you can take. 

The first of which is when you live for yourself. That means you pursue what makes you happy and whatever desires you have, examples include: pursuing a great job to make money, putting yourself out there to meet women and form relationships, and travelling around the world to see new places and experiences. Basically, you put yourself and your happiness first.

The second pathway is when you live for your family instead of yourself. This means you pursue a great job to support your family and have a roof over their head, finishing university to make your mother proud, and supporting your cousins in whatever endeavor they undertake. Basically, you put your family first and yourself second.   

I tried and failed at the first pathway, because despite my best efforts I am struggling to find a job, haven’t ever had a girlfriend or women show interest, struggling in university and am really broke. At the age of 25 I’ve missed every great opportunity to form an amazing life with friends and an amazing woman, and have completely given up. 

So I then started to look at the second pathway, I figured if I can’t live for myself and find happiness, then instead I can live for my family and try to make them happy. However, I also failed in this regard too because my family is extremely toxic and dysfunctional, and I don’t think they love me anymore. My father is an abusive alcoholic and my younger sister makes fun of me all the time for being a loser. My mother is amazing, but recently she’s been giving up on me due to my struggles and failures. My family doesn’t love or believe in me anymore. 

So that’s it then really, the pathways in life that I believe one should take are both blocked to me. I can’t live for myself because I’m a loser virgin with no hope, and I can’t live and fight for my family because they don’t love me anymore. So, what do I fight for now?

1701301076.0,romantic relationship thoughts,"Hi everyone

I hesitated to write here but I feel the need to share my views on relationship and confront my ideas through rational prism.I've always been single and mostly rejecting romantic love and couple. I'm a man of 27 yo. This rejection has extended to love in all forms, including family and friends, even though it didn't last as I got into very dark mental places.

I will focus below on romantic love

1. **Attraction** to someone based on psychological and/or physical characteristics  
the formula is highly complex and by no mean do I try to master it, but it's interesting to try list some factors- one's scent and overall physical chemistry- physical attributes, attitude or character that is reminiscent of one's figure contemplated in his environment or seems complementary at given time in their life- sexual desire also nurtured by the above, hormones and complex factors
2. **Projections**  
beyond attraction, projections nurture the idea that the object is able to respond to some human primary needs: affective, sexual, inner void, sense of meaning,...
3. **Chemical bound**  
when the two above are met, should it be instantly of after some time, chemical response will eventually bound the two and be identified as first sign of Love arisingI don't associate love with this chemical reaction, so that a crush is not necessarily Love, but it may start with it
4. **Pairing, needs bound and material strenghtening**  
pairing can take the form of an exclusive couple, or any other form (open relationship,...)but one's recognize his love and expresses it, and it's met with reciprocality in feelings.  
It comes with the charge  to participate in fulfilling part of affective needs of each otherIt's a contract which terms are not explicited, demanding active participation of both into fulfilling these needs.   
Both demand and love reinsurance can be expressed through a Love discourse (do you love me? I love you), or other active proofs overtime.  
There can be social constructs aiming at securing love (and therefore needs fulfillment) under forms of Marriage, family, material mutual possessions and life projects making it difficult, consciously but often inconsciously, to come to separation later. Not all of the listed is strictly deriving from need to secure love but they can be part of it
5. **Projections disappointment and Chemical bound fading**  
eventually one comes to realize the other is not up to his initial projections which can have effect on the chemical bound that therefore ceases to effect. it can be that one has his needs changing overtime which the other object cannot respond to due to his own characteristics that do not match anymoreIn any case, the chemical bound cannot be sustained overtime and certainly shouldn't have to. It can derive from the projections break it was primarily made to bound into pairing
6. **Attraction fading**  
as desire is nurtured in the absence and risk, and that such love object is easily accessible, attraction can also fade
7. **Attachment & some needs bound**  
what persists in the end can be attachment meaning habit and comfort in the romantic relationship, along with needs that can continue being satisfied. Great risk to it is boredom 

In light of the above, i've always seen love as an exchange of needs on basis of complex factors attraction and needs bounds. Two objects are using each others as to move on in life.I deeply struggle seeing the inherent virtue of this exchange, apart from common idea that it's a need we must compel to

I like to use **extremes to put to the test general ideas**:Now in application to the above

\- what if a man fells in love with a man who shares characteristics of an abuser, and gets being exploited as a prostitute. He will certainly feel Love, and who are we to question it? Some may say it's an exception because he's under influence, yet one can be attracted to abuser characteristics, and will be seeking such object of Love in life. 

\- what if a disabled man meets a woman who sees in him the possibility to achieve meaning in life while having sense of security since he is not able to harm her physically. Now this man recovers and she is losing power and meaning she once had. Remains eventually attachment which may fade with boredom. Was there virtue in this Love?

The same could be said about afterlife, it can't be nothing because you can't experience nothing. But there are problems ive seen here, like what if consciousness can't be recovered when lost? This is a bit paradoxical because you can't experience non existance, but going back to maths, there is this paradox where it says no matter how many times you throw a dart at the board it will logically only land at the same place one time and never again. This is a big problem for afterlife because it could mean that things like consciousness could possibly happen once, but again maybe that is wrong because non existance can't be experienced but there is this paradox that says things are unrecoverable in this case making non existence experiancable. If we disprove the dart paradox and that things can happen once and never happen again we prove afterlife.",1

We are all just atoms bound to turn into other things eternally.

1701240806.0,my grandma just passed.,"TRIGGER WARNING (d3ath and grief) 

It has been one week since I lost my grandma. I’ve been helping take care of her for the last two years, until six months ago she had her first major stroke and I transitioned into taking care of her full time. She was my best friend, the first person to hold me after I was born, and the only person in the world which I had an unworldly connection with. I was the person who found her having a major stroke and had to call 911. She passed away two days later. I’m not a religious person, but in moments like these, I wish I were. I miss her so much. My heart aches every single day. My mom and her siblings grew up in my grandmas house. My grandpa helped build it in the 50s, and it’s one of the only original houses on my block. I’ve been living here with my uncle and my grandma for the last 3 years, but I also grew up here. My family is going to sell the house to a builder, and it makes me so frustrated to think about how we can’t afford to keep it. The house is going to be torn down and over time it’s going to be rebuilt over by some rich family, and my whole childhood home is going to be erased, like it was never there. I’ve been struggling with the idea of how we have such a short amount of time in this life. We have so little time to LIVE. Especially now adays, I feel like we have been robbed of our quality of life. When I see my uncle and the rest of my family I see the little kids they once were. Time slips by all of us, and we all grow up so fast. The people we love die. Our bodies grow old and we too will become just another portrait on our family’s wall. A distant memory. I’m so tired of living sometimes. I don’t know the point. I know life is beautiful and I am grateful to be here, but the pain which comes along with living is so heavy. I’m 23 and I know I am young, but I can’t help but think about my death. I just want to be little again. I want my family to be alive again. I can’t help but wonder if I really will see them again after death. What if there really is nothing and pure darkness? I can’t even imagine the day I lose my mother. I’m so tired.

1701231758.0,There's actually a lot evidence for a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives,"This post relates to existentialism because ideas of a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives are often used to counter the idea the world is essentially absurd or meaningless apart from the meaning we arbitrarily ascribe to it. 

I think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit there is conflicting evidence as to the nature of a higher power and an afterlife, if such things exist. I also think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit that anything that can be attributed to the existence of an afterlife or a god has alternative explanations. 

All that said, many, many, many people throughout history testify to having convincing personal experiences of interacting with a higher power or having access to knowledge of an afterlife. 

Furthermore, it is in fact logical to conclude humans are incapable of fully comprehending most of our reality, so just the fact that it is thus far impossible to model or conceive of a scientifically supportable way for consciousness to persist beyond death does not mean consciousness does not persist beyond death. A caterpillar has no way of knowing it will become a butterfly, but it does all the same. A dog has no way of knowing it was the product of selective breeding from wolves, etc. etc.

Just as a pet hamster can never understand the myriad forces that lead it from a pet shop to a child's bedroom, perhaps we similarly cannot comprehend the god or gods involved in our lives.

It is, in fact, a faith-based proposition to assume humans are capable of creating a model that completely explains reality. If humans are like every other species we observe, then we must have limits we cannot surpass, no matter what, and we must be subject to forces, very probably including higher intelligences, that we can never understand. 

So, we KNOW we can't understand everything that affects us. And we KNOW that, if we are like every other observable life form, we are being influenced by HIGHER INTELLIGENCES. If there really is no higher intelligence beyond human intelligence in the universe, than humans are so exceptional that there probably IS a some sort of god responsible.

Combine the near certainty that we are influenced by higher intelligences with the extensive, albeit conflicting, reports of interactions with what appear to be higher powers, and the existence of AT LEAST one such being seems incredibly likely, if, of course, not at all certain.

If you want to take comfort in a godless and absurd universe and the end of consciousness after death, do so. But, similarly, if you want to take comfort in the idea of a greater purpose and an afterlife and a god or gods, do so as well because, MOST LIKELY (although it's impossible to say what the exact odds are) there IS something like a god and there IS something like an afterlife out there (the existence of the god-like being is more likely than the existence of an afterlife).

This does not mean you should abandon reason or critical thinking. Seeing reality for what it is doesn't mean making shit up to fill in what you don't know. For example, a preponderance of evidence indicates atheists can live long and happy lives, and there is certainly nob particularly convincing evidence they inevitably experience eternal punishment in the afterlife (if there is such a thing) either. 

Whatever you do, be open to the truth of reality and do not let your own assumptions override this truth. Try to recognize what you do not or cannot know with certainty, if at all.

Also, if you haven't actually had one of these seeming encounters with a higher power, don't be too quick to dismiss the experiences of those who have. I think a key aspect of these encounters are how convincing they are. It's possible to have the convincing experience without being sure of what you experienced. But if you've never found any ""encounter"" to be convincing, I would argue you've never actually had an encounter, not that you're just smarter or more of a critical thinker than the people who have.

The real test for the skeptic is being confronted with something that is TRULY convincing and still retaining their pre-existing views, which is definitely possible.

1701101233.0,I have reasons to believe in solipsism,"Solipsism is quite terrifying to me, and although there are arguments against it, I have come up with one for it.
I will try to articulate this as well as possible so bear with me.
Firstly, I don’t consider insects to be conscious. They are automatons, and respond to stimuli. A signal makes them run from a predator, or e.g photons enter their eyes, and notify the brain of  the presence of food, causing them to then head towards the food, and so on. They are basically relatively complex systems that respond to stimuli in certain ways. In the future, we could manufacture an ai that functions in the same way, but it wouldn’t have a consciousness. The AIs of today even have the capability to learn.
Let’s take this one step further. Consider a mouse. It is tremendously more complex than the insect, can respond to more external stimuli, can perform more complex actions etc. But just additional complexity shouldn’t create a “consciousness” if the insect doesn’t have it. Let’s go further, for example a monkey. The monkey is a very complex rendition of the insect, it can do a lot more, respond to a lot more and so on, but again, that wouldn’t create consciousness. Let’s now take this to a human. It’s the same deal. Why would the human be conscious, rather than an incredibly developed, complex automaton, like the insect, but has all the additional complexity of creativity, ingenuity, compassion etc. So one of the following things must be true:
 1. Solipsism is real
2. There is some sort of undiscovered “consciousness threshold, everything below it not having consciousness, and everything above it having it.
3. There is a supernatural factor at hand that we cannot prove",1

1700969973.0,Explicatio Infinitum-the Infinite Unfolding: Embracing expanding Consciousness with Hopeful and Pessimistic Optimism,"I saw a post on here the other day and thought to reply, but found myself falling so deeply into the idea that this demanded it's own post.

The post revolved around how there is no greater horror than consciousness and the realization of one's own consciousness. I can honestly say that even putting that as blatantly as stated is a vast understatement and it is objectively true- the expanding of consciousness and realization that all things act as a grand consciousness experiencing itself subjectively is a frightening prospect...

...but, I think that's only objectively true from a subjective standpoint- that is, the Human Experience. From the original Big Bang, consciousness has unfolded at an exponential rate- what started as simple elements and single celled organisms unfolded into multi cellular organisms, to Organisms hosting a plethora of Organelles, to Ecosystems, to the Evolutionary Demand of Sensory organs such as eyes, ears, mouths and Brains to decipher the information as each.

To view one's own thought process and to see it as this nearly mindless progression of thought after thought is a bit silly, but understandable: The mind wonders wildly and imaginatively uncontrollably, whether provoked or not. It is geared to keep fractaling out, over and over and over- from the inside out, it's frightening. but from the outside in? It's nothing less than completely beautiful: even in all of it's chaos, the inherent demand of nature to demand things out of itself to perceive itself simply for the sake of perceiving itself and pushing the bounds of what is to be perceived next is almost like a grand composure, or play, or symphony.

Upon this realization I couldn't help but imagine ""Longwu"" or ""Longdeng"", a celebratory chinese dance involving many performers using poles to rhythmically move a Dragon Prop- except in this dance, each person is branching off of one dragon to create another through another team of people, all dancing to ward off ""Evil Spirits"" or even the ""Ignorances of Evolution"" much how the Scientific Method is used to refute mundane Sciences which don't suit the needs of society or the world any longer. New Dragons Dance to decimate Old Ways of thinking like new technologies or new ideas come along to lay old one's to rest.

If the Ultimate meaning to existence is to create meaning in the absence of it, the universe itself compounds upon consciousness in order to create meaning of creating meaning of creating meaning of creating meaning infinitum- a cycle that repeats and repeats but gets bigger, wiser, better, and more accessible to the next offshoots of lineages and generations of all creatures.

Consciousness unfolds and unfolds and unfolds- and yes, it can absolutely lose meaning. But if you lose yourself in the Dance that proceeds all dances, suddenly you have become something as large as life itself and that is not just a beautiful thing, but a hopeful thing in the lieu of the hopelessness pronounced by the inability of escaping such a cycle.

*Just sharing what I wrote in my notes to myself about this*

“God” does exist, whatever she he or they may be, and they do have a purpose for us humans on this earth, but we just don’t know it yet and *that is the part that we’re supposed to figure out*. There is a clue though. What is insanely remarkable about our species is that we have made so much advancement in understanding the world and universe and life in such a relatively short period of time. So I believe that discovering our purpose will be found in further advancements in knowledge and technology. I mean just think about how truly fucking mindbending it is to think of the earth, assuming it and humans and society still exist, a thousand years from now. I would argue that there is no crazier of a thought one can have. Think of if you got a glimpse into that era. Think of if JESUS got a glimpse into todays era. Or Muhammad or Buddha. Would they be mind blown? Absolutely so. So with this, our purpose is to further our understanding of this all in every single avenue (doctors, coders, aerospace engineers, psychologists, artists, etc) so that we may perhaps find out some day. It’s easy to say that we never will right now, but as much as history repeats itself, it has been a linear advance of progress in knowledge in the long run. 

This is what I believe. I do believe in God and I will sometimes pray to him or thank him (calling him “him” out of cultural convention), but I just don’t know and I think he understands that. I think he wants me to understand it all better. That’s all",1

1700782929.0,Every generation has to defend democracy forever,"I read a comment on Reddit a few days ago and it made realize what I’ve been wanting to avoid. 

I became very involved in politics since before the 2020 election, and this has caused me a lot more anxiety and existentialist issues. I’m a writer and filmmaker, and a very emphatic and sensitive guy. 

I’ve volunteered as an election clerk a few times now, and I’ve experienced very saddening and disappointing encounter with conservatives, mostly because I have an accent, I’m Mexican-American.

Why has politics become so extreme? I barely can go a day without checking the news, hoping to see something positive about the next election or justice being served to the former president.

And now I realize that the problem isn’t just about Trump winning, even if Democrats win for the next 20 years, the next time a Republican wins they will enact their so called “project 2025” plan. They just have to score once and the game ends. Why has the Republican Party become this way? 

Where is the empathy? Respect? Tolerance? 

But I guess this problem is inherent to Democracy and it will never go away. We have to defend it forever. 

I’m just tired, I have enough with my personal problems and conflicts to also worry about all of this I mentioned. It becomes overwhelming. 

Hope is a dangerous thing. 

It might help if anyone could give any advice or just make me feel like I’m not alone in this. ",1
1700778174.0,"When we dont know for 100% certainty that what happens after death, why we doom children to face it?","First of all, this is not an antinatalism rant. It's just something that has been bothering my mind from a philosophical point of view.

Fear of death is universal within humanity. Some fear it more, some less. But 1 thing is clear: no one knows with 100% certainty that what will happen after death. And the dead haven't come back to tell about it. There are stories but no evidence. In other words, people die and they don't come back (at least not as who they were in this life). But what about the fact that unborn children can't die because only those who are born will die. If one is not born, they can't die and therefore can't face death.

Because there are 2 possible outcomes. Either there is nothing after death or there is something after death (aka an afterlife of sorts). Even if you come back, let's say hypothetically as a bird, that's still something instead of nothing (and birds can live horrible, painful lives). Even if you are not aware of it, the pain is still felt by the bird. We who are already alive, are doomed to face either 1 of these death outcome options. We don't know for 100% certainty which one it is but it has to be either one, right? Nothing or something. What else could it even be? And so if the best we got is ""*We don't know*"" then isn't it kinda... *cruel*... to create a conscious human being who will 100% certainly eventually die without knowing for certain what will happen to them afterwards?

Because what if what happens after death is a bad outcome? Like maybe not hell but you know, born again into a new being that has a way worse, more painful life etc.? Something like that, you get my point. The only way to prevent that kind of afterlife would be to not give birth to a new child since unborn can't die and therefore can't face death. And if one tries to argue with the ""*well, maybe pre-birth state is worse*"" then that thought gets really uncomfortable really, really fast... Since 99,999999999% of your potential children will never be born and can't be born. On average, there are 100 million sperms in 1 ejaculation and only 1 of those sperms will fertilize the egg. So are 99 999 999 potential ""souls"" doomed then in this pre-life state? A normal healthy human male can produce about 2 trillion sperms within his lifetime. Some Emperors have had like nearly 1 000 children. But that's still nothing compared to the potential ones they could've had. See where I'm getting at with this? So let's just say that the pre-birth state is pretty alright, it didn't mind you, didn't it, all those billions of years before you were born? I know that this is mostly just a thought experiment but I mean, I can't help but feel that there's a stain of cruelty in the fact that humans create new conscious beings that are doomed to die and we don't know what to tell them about what happens after death.

&#x200B;

""*What if it's bad?*"" might the kid ask.

""*Yeah, well, we don't know, it might be or not, we'll all find out together eventually. It's alright, we are alive now.""* answers the dad.

""*Yes, but not forever. And you forced me here and now I'm forced to face what comes after death by my own.*"" says the kid with a worried look.

1700741863.0,"All wants are false, but some are useful","If you think about it, wants are basically just stories about scenarios or affairs _imagined_ to be pleasant or agreeable. For example, _I want chocolate cake._ This statement tells a story of an imagined scenario where there is me and cake, and in this tale I am happy about it.

In practice, however, none of the details are likely as true as the story would suggest. I cannot really know how events and feelings would unfold. And even then, the further entailment of later events could result in any number of misfortunes. On top of all that, what even _is_ ""I"" ? Is it the body right now? The mind? A figment of the imagination? Can we even be certain the one who gets the cake is the one who asked for it?

Coming back to the meaning and nature of wants, it would seem they are essentially stories of cause-and-effect. To _want_ cake is to believe that cake would bring happiness. This paints a pastry of causation between the entity that is me, and the creature that is cake. Such tales of causality are thus _models_ of reality.

Yet as the saying goes, _all models are wrong, but some are useful._ Therefore, it should follow, since wants are stories, and since stories are models, then _all wants are wrong, yet some are useful._ For example, I may be wrong in my imagined scenario of how things would actually unfold -- perhaps this particular time would defy expectation -- but the tale may nevertheless offer the energy needed to distract myself another moment from that inevitable finality which likely awaits.

In conclusion, what you chase may not -- and indeed almost certainly _does not_ -- actually exist. But this reality need not prevent your being from being consumed in the imaginary pursuit. The cake may not exist, yet your insatiable longing could move the world around you. The carrot is waiting. Won't you bite?",1

Thinking about being “nothing” scared the SHIT out of me at that age. To be fair it still does but I wish I was spared from those fears for a little while longer.

Is love appreciation or association?
If you love a particular flower, do you associate yourself with it by feeling, and eventually picking it from the ground of which it was sprouted from, or do you appreciate it's beauty and elegancy by leaving it be?
I had a crush in the 5th Grade. I appreciated my time with them, yet I wanted to be associated with them through dating them. I don't know what they are doing now or if they're even alive, but I look back onto that day, and question if I ever truly appreciated them, or truly wanted to associate with them.
To take a step further, how can we assert that we love at the right time? Love can happen anytime sure, however, do they happen at just the right moment? Am I following the plot that I am (assumingly) destined behind?
All of these questions with such little answers leave me with brittle bones breaking brashly (nice alliteration GuyCaruso) at the thought of the aforementioned questions.

Not to say that I didn’t know I was going to die before, I did know. I was religious for most of my life, and then fell out of it at around 20 years old (escaped my church and found science and logic). I became an atheist and materialist. But I never truly considered the ramifications of what I believed (or didn’t believe, rather).

It is only with the passing of someone very close to me that I have started to realize that this life that we live in is one giant cosmic horror show. We are imbued with consciousness for whatever reason, and we are seemingly the only beings with the ability to grasp that we are conscious and dying. 

As far as the current scientific literature reaches, dying is like flipping off a light switch. You simply don’t exist anymore. I’ve seen a lot of people say that “you were dead for 17 billion years so it’s not going to bother you after you’re dead” and yes, I realize that. But it certainly is bothering me while I’m alive.

I am a wife and a mother, and I am very happy and content with my life. My life used to be horrible, but I made it into something nice. And now, my ability to enjoy what I have is crushed by the fact that everything I know and love, including my own own consciousness, will someday fade away into the eternal black void of nothing.

I want so badly to believe in some sort of extension of consciousness or soul or whatever, but my logical brain is not allowing me to do so, despite my best wishes. I wish I were not so damned aware.

Idealists believe that nothing exists outside the mind. The cogito, simulation theory, manifestation, quantum physics, all fall into this category.

This is a very important distinction when it comes to problem-solving. Do we employ medication or therapy? Belief or brute force? Usually a combo works best.

If the double slit experiment indicates light is a wave and a particle, why can’t reality be both, existing simultaneously, and harmoniously? Why can’t the universe be somehow material AND mind? What if material objects obey their own laws and mind follows its own?

Nihilism is correlated with existential inquiry, but does not constitute a valid conclusion.

Existentialism exists *because* of a lack of conclusion.

Emotions are not conducive to rational thinking and objective assessment.

Existentialism is a space where people come to critique the human experience because they have a suspicion that things are not what the status quo asserts they are. 

When we profess that we know the meaning of life and it's meaningless, we have retired from the inquiry to allow our ego to lick its wounds.

I think it is time that critics of existentialism acknowledge that individual pathology does not define the genre.

Correlation alone does not prove causation.

Things like holy war, genocide, terrorism and torture may be strongly correlated with religious beliefs but that does not equate to absolute proof of causation.

Existentialism is intensely uncomfortable for people who feel a need to control their reality, because they find that down here everyone is a hypocrite, we are all equally flawed, and there is no chance at supremacy or progress.

I often ask myself why I bother, but I feel a deep sense of obligation to humble myself by witnessing this phenomena because I have experienced enough trauma, injustice and absurdity to land me next to Job in the Bible and I'm tired of watching everyone else lie to themselves and perpetuate the cycle of hubris.

I am also addicted to the fleeting glimpses of ego death, they are the most pleasurable experiences I have ever had, and they have helped me overcome my own mental health woes more effectively than any medicine or therapy.

Anyhow, when it comes down to it, we can put a line between ""Western ideologies"" (be they philosophical or religious) and ""non-Western ones"", and that might be a bit reductive, but I think you get the point that I will make. So, in the majority of Western ideologies, especially religion, people see life and death as two separate things, right? Life is now, death is after; is there a heaven? Hell? Nothing? Mind you, atheists or people, who hold generally average religious-ish beliefs, they still perceive life in ""I exist now"" and ""I won't exist then.""   


Okay, cool, however I, recently, had this moment of clarity; it's a lie. As in, life and death are not opposing forces, nor are they two different forces to begin with - rather, what we call life and death are one thing, that simply, as the universe as a whole, shifts and changes with time. Even though I am agnostic, you could say that I believe in reincarnation, but not in a spiritual way, but (as much as you can say that, of course) logical way. I try to base my hypothetical beliefs in some object facts to give them some ground (even though I believe that object reality does not exist, however) and this is why I thought of the concept that ""nothing comes from nothing and something cannot be utterly destroyed"". Thinking about it and recent discoveries in concepts of quantum physics, quantum information, and elasticity of dark matter (or was it anti-matter? (that might suggest that, rather than expending forever, galaxy will reach a point before snapping back in)) I came to this idea that after ""death"" you don't simply cease to be, but rather, thing that makes you you (soul, energy, consciousness, mind, spirit, call it however) goes on to make something new (same how rotting corpse feeds new life) or it gets broken down to its most basic components and then gets recycled anew (perhaps sapient life is peak of existence and, after that, essence breaks down and begins to reshape anew, same how stars and planets in the universe became denser and more complex with time)   


To that end, life and death are not two separate things, they are one thing, flowing - therefore, being alive is nothing more than just being ""awake for a moment"", similarly how you can be awake and asleep. Life, you can say, is a moment of lucidity in your infinity of existence. That, of course, would still get into the idea that you, the real you, your personality, is dead upon your, well, death, but I might have an idea for that too; I mentioned the concept of quantum information before, and while it is still in it's early stage, there is an idea that information can leave an imprint on the very fabric of time and space. That's how, for example, theoretically, we could trace that information to before the Big Bang and see how it went down; and, theoretically, if such advanced technology were to exist, who to say that it would not be able to reconstruct the history of humanity from the imprint that it left on the fabric of time and space, same how they could read the beginning of Big Bang? That would give an explanation to people seeing their dead loved ones in dreams; if your very being, who you were, left an imprint on fabric of time and space, you, similarly, don't simply cease to be, but rather, remain part of existence forever.   


While I know that this might come off as optimistic or religious, I do mean it in a very logical sense; we, humans, perceive time as a continuous thing, that as past, present, and future. However, there is nothing objective to suggest it is really such, and therefore, time might be a singular thing, the singular is. To that end, if physical things leave imprints of the fabric of time and space (or reality, if you wish), if material leaves a mark on immaterial, who is to say that your very being won't be part of this everpresent is?   


I always struggled with the idea of death and annihilation of existence, not because it scares me (though it does) but because it simply seems so illogical and unnatural to how the rest of the universe works. After some time thinking, this is what I got. ",1

I just feel so misunderstood, no amount of philosophy or science and even religion has done anything to improve my life.none of it applies to me. I’m not asking for more money or to look physically better. Those are always a good thing but I seriously ask for someone to touch my soul. I feel like no one gets my struggle and many people underestimate my struggle. I’ve been to mental hospitals and done therapy. That shows just how desperate I am. No matter what I do or try. No matter who I talk to. No matter the location the person and their credentials none of it applies to me. None of it makes me happy none of it truly lights a spark in my brain intellectually or brightens me spiritually.

I’ve been making posts like this since I was 14 years old. I’m quite the patient person. Most people in my situation would gladly jump in a trains path. But I am patient and I do not feel the need to cry about my problems. I am trying to improve.

6 years I’ve been living like this. I’m a 20 year old man now. It’s been far too long. Does anyone know how to get out of this state?",1
1700520892.0,My theory on death,"I think there’s one thing we know for sure about death: it is the end of suffering. 

You know those nights where you have no dreams? I believe that is death. I believe we all experience the feeling of death many many times in our lives. 

No pleasure. 

No pain. 

It’s fine. 

If you have more pleasure than pain in your life, you may fear death. If you have more pain than pleasure, you may not worry about death.. or even prefer it. 

My meaning is to have as much pleasure (as opposed to pain) during my time on earth. And who knows, if religion turns out to be real, then there’s something to look forward to after death as well. Call it a bonus.

1700473178.0,Do people just accept the circumstances we exist under?,"A rant about every single condition of existence.

I (22F) am someone who has never understood the social contracts of reality. Why can’t I say what I want when I am thinking it? Examples that come to mind are sororities and corporate offices. 

Like, who is subjecting themselves to these environments voluntarily and not questioning the structures that attempt to control and regulate our emotions and behaviors? 

Why does everyone tell me to “chill” when I say the thought of sending corporate friendly emails for the rest of my life makes me want to tear my own skin off. Do people not think this is weird? Like I have to work a job (which by the way most jobs are made up to sustain the unnecessary eccentricities of existence) in order to make money in order to eat food and provide shelter and survive.

Like… does that not seem kind of barbaric? And I have to wear loafers and pants while doing it? Everyone else just agrees to do this and now I’m subjected to it too?? 

Another thing. What’s the point of old politicians grasping onto power in their dying years. When I realized that many politicians only incentive was to gain power as an individual, and not for any larger purpose. I was mind blown. Like… that’s just a super strange avenue to seek power for powers sake. 

Ok lastly. I have no career ambitions, no desire to have children, no desire to pursue a romantic relationship. I wanted to be famous in some capacity when I was growing up but I think I just wanted attention. So now I’m just alive and unemployed looking for a job while contemplating the purpose of having to have a linked in account. Like I truly do not care about what my peers are doing, and why must I be business formal on a form of social media. Give me a break. 

I know I could pursue simpler avenues of life that don’t exist in corporate spaces but idk I haven’t come to terms with it yet. 

I always wished I was a Christian who never questioned my faith and became an elementary school teacher. Instead, I was raised atheist by an engineer and a chemist.  And a father with a masters in philosophy. So that was never my fate. 

Now I just wallow in self pity and grow jealous of people with purpose or those who are aware of the conditions of suffering but just accept it. And a part of me wishes that there’s an afterlife so I can see my dog again. Anyways.. there’s no question. Just contemplating the circumstances of the human condition.",1

1700310789.0,Am I an existentialist?,"Hey y’all, basically I am what many here in this sub have called a “biological determinist” due to my observation through science of how our brain works and the most simple explanation of consciousness is that it is simply a perception of those neural cascades and that cognitive awareness itself creates this existencial layer to reality. In essence we are causally determined down to the quantum level as far as science has been able to observe, above that level we are a chain of dominos, our conscious perception a window into reality. However to add onto that I too have felt a visceral connection to the universe and others around me that would have me posit that there is so much more than our human perception. We are all connected and windows into the same universe, we are the universe experiencing itself.

However, I then see the viability of existentialism and even sopholism for their focus on free will and the conscious mind, becuase that is how we must on this level derive ethics and how to coexist. Yet maintaining in mind that is is all just the experience of a passing moment in the universe, no true “control” or at least evidence thereof.

And then I am open to the possibility of anything beyond the realm of what we have been able to observe in science, what if perhaps our brains and senses act as a sort of sounding rod or grounding wire for the consciousness of the universe itself? Maybe it guides us quantumly, maybe our act guides it similar to that story of the egg, maybe this is the matrix. Honestly I don’t know and choose to not believe so wholeheartedly or dogmatical in anything beyond the realm of scientific evidence.

Anyway if any of y’all have anything to say on my ramblings as a causal determinist avid in entheogens, I’m all ears :)

1700194866.0,Loving is painful,"When I was a kid, I didn't think I could love my mom any more than I already did. I never once hated her or felt any anger towards her. As I got older, I could look back and see everything she had done for me and my brother. Her main focus has always been us. Besides just being the best mom, she is also the best person I know. I genuinely try my hardest to be like her every day.

All these points, and many more, have made my love grow even more for her. But it also makes me dread the day she dies even more too. That I will lose the one person I love over everything else in this world. The moment I first realized this is when I saw her for the first time in a long time. I got home super excited and hugged her. I felt her skin and it was so thin. Ik it's a weird detail but it really freaked me out. After that I started noticing how frail she looked, that age had started to catch up to her.

1700171862.0,How cruel is planet Earth,"Imagining we were put on this universe on planet Earth. Different Species, organisms, emerging to evolve- some flourish and grow, some get eaten up or disposed of by others. You have to compete and hurt others to be able to evolve. So the species that survive obviously had to be the brutal ones, and they’re the ones who evolve and grow and reproduce. So the species that is evolving further wants to literally live on planet earth even if its nature is just full off torture, but at the same time you’re forced to act because of survival needs. So are we literally choosing to continue and live in this hell? 

There may be some who haven’t experienced much trauma and may not grasp how dark reality gets, and there may be those who have experienced a great amount of trauma from torturous cruel events.

This blog explores the relevance of Seneca's teachings in the 21st century and how they can provide a philosophical anchor that transcends the ages.

It delves into the relevance of Seneca's teachings on virtue, resilience, and mindful living in the context of contemporary life. Seneca's steadfast advocacy for virtue as the highest good provides a compass for ethical decision-making in a world often characterized by moral ambiguity and shifting values. Meanwhile, his insights on resilience and reason offer a Stoic framework for navigating the challenges of a fast-paced life with grace and composure.

Seneca's philosophy also challenges prevailing norms of consumerism and the pursuit of financial success by encouraging reflection on our relationship with possessions and the true meaning of wealth. It concludes by exploring practical applications of Seneca's philosophy in the modern world and how individuals can integrate these principles into their daily lives to foster a resilient mindset, ethical decision-making, and a mindful approach to success and well-being.

In summary, Seneca's timeless wisdom offers actionable insights for those seeking a more intentional and fulfilling existence in our fast-paced contemporary world. Despite the temporal abyss that separates us, his teachings remain a beacon of light, guiding us toward a more meaningful and virtuous existence in the modern world.",1

That question hit me hard, as I didn't have a good answer for myself. I was locking myself away in my room, barely getting out of bed, ignoring phone calls and texts, not taking care of myself, not eating, not sleeping well and sleeping all day/staying up all night until I passed out when the sun rose. I was sleeping my life into the grave, probably on the brink of my deathbed. I did this for 3 months, maybe longer. 

Something caved. I decided to attempt to fix my sleep schedule. I started eating, cleaning myself, getting myself back up to health. Just last night, I flossed my swollen gums while brushing the blood away, started crying as I thought to myself,

1699981999.0,Existentialism and Love,"I want to reflect on love. To do so, I remember Martin Buber’s I-You versus I-It distinction. There is no such thing as an “I” in existence. “I” can only occur in a relation to something or someone else. He writes, “The basic word I-You can be spoken only with one’s whole being. The concentration and fusion into a whole being can never be accomplished by me, can never be accomplished without me. I require a You to become; becoming I, I say You (62).” 

This is a poetic way of describing, I think, the call I find again and again in existentialism to be open to another person, to care for another person, to love another person. To love in the correct way is not a flight from myself, but rather a return to myself. A becoming of myself. 

I am re-reading Kierkegaard’s Works of Love, and I am continually challenged, offended, and elevated by his description of the strenuous task of loving my neighbor. I ought not possess my neighbor. I cannot ensure that my love for my neighbor will be received as love. So many attempts that I might make to love my neighbor sincerely might actually hide underlying selfish motivations to seem to be this or that kind of person. 

We often describe the “nothing” that underlies human existence in nihilistic terms, as a groundless vacuity from which we were hurled at birth and into which we will be sucked back again at death. But I also see this “nothing” as the openness that makes the possibility of an encounter with another person possible. From this emptiness, I am open. I am without judgment. I am available to you and therefore to myself. 

I wonder if this idea strikes a cord with anybody else.",1

Fact: I also experience the sensations of emotion and thought.

The following argument is based on those two facts. \[If the list of sensations were changed (for example, I might divide thought into 1) creative thought, as when I write a short story, 2) logical thought, as when I follow a mathematical proof, and 3) just thought, as in “What am I going to have for lunch?”), that wouldn’t change the argument.\]

So, I directly experience the sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, emotion and thought. That’s ALL I directly experience. I do not directly experience matter because I have no sense that directly detects matter. Matter is a theoretical construct. Matter is an idea I use to make sense of sensations.

For instance, I have a particular visual sensation and think the idea of “coffee mug.” The idea tells me what tactile sensations to expect if I touch the cup, what visual sensations to expect if I rotate the cup, what auditory sensations to expect if I drop the cup.

I do not have a special coffee mug sense that directly allows me to experience a coffee cup. So, I cannot directly experience the coffee mug. Rather, I experience sensations that together correspond to the existence of a coffee cup. All of the sensations I associate with the idea of coffee mug could occur in a vivid dream. In the dream, the sensations would exist, but no coffee mug would exist.

I can be 100% certain of what I directly experience. If I have the visual sensation of water, the sensation is unarguable. The water may or may not exist; if I’m seeing a mirage, no water exists.

I’m like a security guard that takes an elevator to the 12th floor and watches monitors of the loading dock, stairwells, etc. but who is never allowed outside the monitoring room. All I directly experience is images on monitors. The dock, stairwells, etc. may indeed exist. But I never directly experience them.

In philosophy, we have Descartes’ evil demon. We have the brain in a vat. We have the idea that the universe is a simulation. And there’s the Matrix movies. All point to the fact that we do not directly experience matter and that matter may be no more than a theological construct.

Matter is a very good theory. It’s a wonderful working hypothesis that explains what I experience. But, in the final analysis, matter remains a theoretical construct. Matter is an idea I use to explain and understand what I actually directly experience, i.e., sensations in consciousness.

All I can be 100% certain about is the existence of sensations in consciousness.

But the age 12 my life had changed. I had lost all my friends, lost my humorous personality, lost my intelligence, I had became emotionless and depressed. Basically I had lost everything I ever had and what made me in a change of a year. I will not like to explain every little thing but the point is the fine line was crossed. The boundary was broken. I had went to a happy and charmingly humurous kid to a lifeless robot eve as a child of 12. At the age of 12 speaking. I had been fascinated with psychology at the time and wanted to learn more to be a psychologist. Although I never got diagnosed with any mental illness or been hospitalized I still had a fascination with the brain and helping people. This is after I had denied the existence of mental illness. I never had any sympathy for people with mental illness as I thought the majority of their problems were made up. But then one thing leads to another and I was the most mentally ill and lonely 12 year old I knew. And that continued on to teenage and adult years. This is all to say you can be happy and giggly.

He quotes Dostoyevsky, who claimed that existence is meaningless if one does not believe in eternity/God. Here is the quote by Dostoyevsky:
> “Since in reply to my questions about happiness, I am told,
> through the intermediary of my consciousness, that I cannot be
> happy except in harmony with the great all, which I cannot
> conceive and shall never be in a position to conceive, it is evident...”

> ""... and since I consider this comedy perpetrated by nature altogether
> stupid, and since I even deem it humiliating for me to deign to play it ...”

> “In my indisputable capacity of plaintiff and defendant, of
> judge and accused, I condemn that nature which, with such
> impudent nerve, brought me into being in order to suffer—I
> condemn it to be annihilated with me.”

And Camus summarizes Dostoyevsky's thoughts with this sentence:
> ""Existence is illusory **OR** it is eternal.""

Meaning that either God exists and we would have eternal existence (souls and stuff), or not, in which case we would have a short life and then a permanent death which would erase our existence, making it somewhat illusory/temporary.

Then, throughout the chapter Camus analyzes how Dostoyevsky's characters Kirilov (from the novel Demons) and the Karamazov bros (from the novel The Brothers Karamazov) deal with the problem of existence, either by committing suicide (like Kirilov), by admitting the absurdity and incomprehensibility of existence (like Ivan Karamazov), or by taking a leap of faith and believing in God (like Alyosha Karamazov).

The chapter concludes with this:
> ""The surprising reply of the creator to his characters, of Dostoevsky to Kirilov,
> can indeed be summed up thus: existence is illusory **AND** it is eternal.""

From ""illusory OR eternal"" it changed to ""illusory AND eternal"" at the end of the chapter. What do you think this means?",1

## After Life

One of the ego’s prime motivations is survival; one of its prime fears is death. If death is the end, then we simply cease to exist—an idea that horrifies some people.

What happens to me after death? Do I survive in some form or another? We’ll explore the questions and *speculate* about some answers, without pretending to any special knowledge as to what actually occurs.

## After Life: Heaven and Hell

One answer to the question of what happens after death is that my eternal soul survives. Some religions say the soul exists for all eternity, ultimately in either heaven or hell.\[i\] The soul is not God. It is separate and distinct from God. It is ontologically basic. God creates the soul but once created, it exists for all eternity.

The idea of an eternal heaven and hell raises some problems.

The first problem is that heaven or hell seem inappropriate for the great majority of people, who live moderately good lives (but don’t dedicate themselves to helping the poor, or to ceaselessly praying to God) and moderately bad lives (sometimes dishonest or selfish or unkind).

The second problem concerns the nature of the self. Over a lifetime, a person will have many selves, e.g., the infant, the student; the employee; the spouse, the parent, the grandparent. Given that temporary selves come and go, we may ask: Which of our many temporary selves persist into the afterlife? Which selves go to heaven (or hell)?

Consider, for example, Saint Augustine, who was sexually active in his youth, fathering a son with a woman he never married. He famously prayed: “God, give me chastity and continency, only not yet.” Later, he repented and became a saint. Did Augustine’s erotic self go to heaven along with his saintly self? 

Or consider Zoe, a sweet old woman who passed at 90. Imagine Zoe had a characteristic fault, say, envy. If Zoe goes to heaven, does her envious self go there, too?

Another problem: once in heaven can I change and grow? Can I gain and lose temporary selves? Suppose Ann, Zoe’s granddaughter, looks forward to meeting Zoe in heaven. Ann remembers Zoe as she was at 90. But suppose in heaven Zoe prefers her 19-year-old body to her 90-year-old body. And suppose Zoe’s envious self no longer exists. And suppose Zoe has satisfied a lifelong wish to understand Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Being in heaven, she can easily fulfill that wish. When Ann finally meets Zoe in heaven, does she meet the person she expected to meet? Or a disappointingly different person?

Further, in heaven, Zoe can learn anything she wishes and—within limits—become anything she wishes. Within limits. But eternity is a long, long, long time. After untold billions and trillions of years, do the limits chafe? Might Zoe eventually desire the ultimate: to become God? The legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven seems to answer “Yes.” The story suggests eternal existence as a separate person may ultimately become unsatisfying. Perhaps only God can withstand eternity.

Millions long for immortality who don't know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon. — Susan Ertz

Another observation is that heaven and hell make the universe (also called “creation”) pointless. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Eventually, only heaven and hell will exist. Many Christians believe that will occur at the second coming of Jesus. A Catholic might say later, after all the souls in purgatory have paid their debt and migrated to heaven. But Christians agree that at some time in the future only heaven and hell will exist.

2. Before creation, God knew exactly which people would end up in heaven and which people would end up in hell (assuming God can foresee the future).

3. God could have created people destined for heaven IN HEAVEN, bypassing life on earth entirely. God could have created people destined for hell IN HELL, bypassing life on earth entirely.

4. Conclusion: The entire drama of creation—the Fall, the passion of Jesus, etc., etc.—is entirely unnecessary. God could have skipped creation entirely. God could have created in heaven people who God knew would go there. God could have created in hell people who God knew would go there. (A kinder, gentler God would have simply not created people who would end up in hell.)

It seems there are logical problems with the idea of an eternal soul and an eternal heaven and hell.\[ii\] Of course, if eternally individual souls in an eternal heaven or hell were ever proven to exist then we’d need to revise or abandon our basic premise of monism—something we should always be willing to do if we want to follow the evidence.

## After Life: Reincarnation

Another answer to the question of what happens to me after death is that I eventually reincarnate. To be more precise, the permanent self and some traits and tendencies\[iii\] eventually reincarnate. This idea occurs in Hinduism where, in one version, the *jivatma* is the individual soul which reincarnates but “after a long process of development and experience again returns to the unity of the Ātmā,”\[iv\] i.e., the One. In this view, a permanent individual self is not eternal; it ultimately merges back with the One, from whence it came, as a river merges with the ocean.

Buddhism also has the idea of reincarnation except in Buddhism no permanent self exists. Buddhism says that the permanent self is illusory. It says there is nothing underlying the temporary selves that come and go.\[v\] We are at any time merely a bundle of our current temporary selves. This idea occurs in Buddhism’s *Anatta*\[vi\] doctrine (non-self doctrine) which says I consist only of the “five aggregates”: perception, material form, feelings, mental activity, and consciousness. At death, the five aggregates cease to function or disperse (as the atoms of our body return to the biosphere) and I simply cease to exist.

Yet Buddhism accepts that reincarnation is possible. Reincarnation of what? A difficult question. One answer is that, as in Hinduism, some residue of our temporary selves somehow forms the personality of a newborn. Just as one candle lights another, passing on its flame, somehow our tendencies pass on to another being, a being which also lacks a permanent self.

## After Life: Between Lives

Let’s suppose I and the body have parted, but I’m still am aware of thoughts and emotions. I as consciousness along with some emotional and mental tendencies somehow continue to exist. What would it be like? Like dreaming? Like being alone in a dark room?

Like being trapped in some closed, confined space? No. If I’ve left the body, then I am spaceless. Without a body, what is there to be confined? Can a box confine thought? Can a box limit emotion? Can a box imprison consciousness? Evidently not. So, let’s imagine the emotion/thought/consciousness complex free floating, in some vast space, or a place where the word “space” has no meaning.

A fish freed from a bottle, swimming in a vast ocean, might look back at the bottle and notice how small and limiting the bottle was. We might reflect on what the body/emotion/mind complex usually contained: merely pleasant or unpleasant body sensations, happy or sad emotions, thoughts of various kinds. Nothing profound, usually. We might see memory, too, and all the past snapshots memory holds. And it all might seems so . . . small. Finite. Interesting in its own way. But does it all merit remembering? Or can much of it be forgotten?\[vii\] Most people are born with no memory of a past life. And for those that do claim memories of a past life, the memories are often of a traumatic incident such as being executed or dying in some accident. If we reincarnate, do we routinely forget most of our past life?\[viii\]

Let’s now imagine consciousness in the between-lives state. *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*\[ix\] describes what occurs, according to Tibetan belief. Briefly, the consciousness/tendencies complex begins a natural ascent to its source, its ultimate ground: the Real. On first encountering the Incomprehensible Boundless Light, some deceased persons merge, losing their separate identity and ending reincarnations. Other deceased persons retreat from the intensity of supreme naked reality, and descend to lower levels of existence. The text describes the deceased as experiencing “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities before finally incarnating in a physical body. We might imagine some deceased persons able to wander in the Mindscape, sampling thoughts and ideas as they please. We might imagine others wandering the Emotescape, sampling emotions of all kinds. Others descend to the physical plane, taking birth in another body, previous existence having been mostly forgotten, although there are stories of young children recalling scenes from an alleged previous life. Reincarnation has occurred.

*The Tibetan Book of the Dead* says the “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities are projections of one’s own mind. We might imagine experiencing peaceful deities as heaven and wrathful deities as hell. But why would our own mind create such experiences?

Imagine a loving person who spent their life helping others, trying to make the world a better place. A person who thought, mostly, kind, loving and noble thoughts. That person alone with his/her emotions and thoughts would be in a light, elevated place: a “heaven.”

On the other hand, imagine a person who spent a life filled with greed, hate, and anger alone with those emotions. He will have no one to hate but himself. No one to be the target of his anger but himself. The experience would be a dark, oppressive state: a “hell.”

Thus, there could be a type of judgment built into the universe, without the need of some God who is a person. A judgment based on the fact that it’s more comfortable to experience love rather than hate, more comfortable to experience peace rather than violence. There could be a temporary, non-eternal heaven and hell awaiting us in the between-lives state.

## After Life: No Afterlife

Death is when the body ceases to function. Perhaps our emotional and mental activities also cease to exist. Perhaps, our consciousness ceases to function, too. Consciousness seems to disappear during deep sleep, so it’s easy to believe it ceases to exist after death.

So, another answer is that at death my deep self and temporary selves simply cease to exist. One moment I’m consciousness—let’s say, right now. The next moment Arthur is nowhere to be found.\[x\] His permanent self, if he had one, has vanished. Death is the end, utter annihilation.

Let’s suppose for a moment that this is the case; that when I die, I utterly cease to exist. Many people would find the idea frightening, even horrifying. However, if I cease to exist, I won’t be there to know it. The thought is not so threatening when I realize that I can never experience the state of non-existing.\[xi\] After I realize that, ceasing to exist may seem less fearful, even inconsequential. For, if we rule out reincarnation, then before I existed, I couldn’t experience anything, including the state of non-existing.

“I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” — Mark Twain

Similarly, if I utterly cease to exist after death, I’ll never know it. I’ll never experience it. I can only experience the thought of non-existing. A thought may be sad or frightening, but it’s still only a thought. Thoughts come and go.

Sadness might be a more appropriate response. For if I cease to exist upon death, then all those who have died previously—family members, friends, acquaintances—have ceased to exist, too. If that were true, it would be natural to experience sadness.

Many people are deeply attached to the idea of an eternal soul, or to some sort of continued existence. The no-afterlife answer may appear threatening and frightening. It’s natural that an ego would regard non-existence as a horror.

A response is that being a soul—being an eternal individual, eternally separate from God—may not be so desirable, as we noted previously in the legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven.

Also, we can contrast the idea of an eternal soul with another, possibly superior, concept. The idea of an eternal soul says we came *into* the universe. It suggests we are not a part of nature, but spiritual visitors in a material world. Thus, the only world we know is depreciated. Matter is dumb and “there must be something more.” And the environment suffers abuse.

A possibly superior concept is that we didn’t come coming into the universe; we came *out of* it.\[xii\] Our relation to the universe is like that of the apple to the apple tree. That I (or, at least, my body) came out of the universe is why the common elements of the universe (with one exception) are the common elements of my body. The most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, in descending order. Helium is a noble gas that doesn’t combine with other elements to form molecules. If we discard helium, we find that the most abundant elements in the human body are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, in descending order.

The universe has become me (and everything else). And we know matter is hardly dumb. Rather, it contains complexity beyond imagination. In trying to understand matter, we are forced to ideas like string theory and quantum field theory, complex theories that may not be complex enough to capture all that matter can do.

If we call matter “dumb” we insult ourselves, because matter is what we are. If we understood ourselves correctly—as temporary manifestations of something vast and ancient beyond comprehension—that would be enough.

So, suppose death is the utter end to Arthur. So what? Why should I care if my finite self persists beyond the life of the body? Most of the time, my finite self focuses on corresponding finite concerns - how to be comfortable; how to gain wealth, power and fame—or focuses on entertainment that puts the mind in a passive state, so that I can hardly remember an advertisement I saw just a few minutes ago. Of course, our lives are also filled with noble moments, too. Moments of love, of empathy, of elevated thoughts. But these moments pale measured against our infinite self, our vast and ancient larger self, the universe itself.

Perhaps, eternal existence as a limited, finite self is not as desirable as it seems. In any case, it can be argued that non-existence is nothing to fear.

## Self-Transcendence

Suppose I am entirely physical. Suppose I am matter and only matter, matter that somehow is conscious and intelligent. Suppose my destiny as an individual is annihilation. When I die, I utterly cease to exist. The biosphere absorbs my body’s atoms. My emotions, mind, and consciousness simply cease to be. This idea may seem unwelcome, threatening, and frightening. But considered deeply, it can lead to self-transcendence. And self-transcendence can be viewed as a type of salvation, salvation from fear of death.

As we’ve seen, if I’m merely matter, matter which lacks a soul, then it’s plain that I didn’t come into the universe; I came out of it. My body emerged from the universe. I emerged from the universe. I am not separate from the universe but a part of it. The universe gave me birth. It is my parent. Something which is ancient and vast beyond imagination has given me birth. I am a person on a planet with billions of other people, a planet that is a microscopic speck of dust in an almost infinite universe.

I am a small speck. Yet, I can contemplate the vast and ancient universe. I feel my small presence in the infinite universe and the feeling is an odd mixture: one part realizing my own smallness and insignificance; one part feeling a part of a vast, magnificent universe, no matter if only an infinitesimally small part. The universe has created me. I am not the universe but the universe is me, just as the wave is not the ocean but the ocean is the wave. Something ancient and vast has become me. 

*The God’s Script****\[xiii\]*** by Jorge Luis Borges tells the story of Tzinacán, an Aztec priest imprisoned and tortured by the Spaniards. After decades in prison, Tzinacán has a vision; he believes certain words of power will destroy his stone prison, evict the Spaniards, reconstruct his nation, and make him immortal. But he knows he never shall utter the words, because “Whoever has seen the universe, whoever has beheld the fiery designs of the universe, cannot think in terms of one man, or that man’s trivial fortunes or misfortunes, though he be that very man.”

Tzinacán has achieved salvation, salvation from ego concerns, a type of salvation unlike the ego salvation of Old Theology religions.

We live in an unimaginably vast and ancient universe. Yet, our concerns often revolve about ourselves. Ego issues dominate: “I want to go to heaven. I want to be reincarnated. I. Me. I.” Ego concerns are understandable; they help us survive. But the person who can self-transcend, who can rise above ego; the person who can say to the Real, “You exist. And that’s enough for me. *What does it matter if this finite, flawed human being lives for eternity, or is snuffed out like a candle?*”—that person has a faith and a love for God far above those who practice religion out of fear of hell, hope of heaven, or of a better reincarnation.

A person who achieves that perspective while still in the body has achieved some degree of self-transcendence. That person finds their “I” in the Real rather than in the ego and its transitory selves. Mystic slogans such as “Die before you die” and “The art of dying” take on a real, literal meaning. Self-transcendence utterly defeats death. For if I die to my transitory selves before the death of my body, then there is nothing that death can take.

## After Life: Recap

To sum up, an axiom of New Theology’s monism is that only the All and the One, the Ultimate Ground of Existence, is ontologically basic. The individual is not ontologically basic. This implies that the human individual is like a figure on a movie screen and would cease to exist but for the action of the light; that the individual is the wave, not the ocean. This view admits two possibilities. First, that upon death the individual simply dissolves, ceases to be. This is often the view of the atheist.\[xiv\] The second is that upon death the individual continues to exist in one form or another, perhaps in heaven or hell, perhaps reincarnating eventually.

Although our fate immediately after death is unknown, in a monist system the ultimate fate of the individual can be nothing other than merging with the ultimate ground of all.

You are not the body. You are not the mind.

You are something different, lying far behind.

\[i\] The after-death destination of Limbo once existed in the Roman Catholic Church but has recently fallen out of favor.

\[ii\] Existence in heaven raises other questions about selfhood. Consider the idea of an assembly of selves. Suppose Joe at six years old was happy and optimistic; a more mature person when he received his first romantic kiss; at twenty, a personal tragedy turned him pessimistic and dour; at forty, Joe was a sober, responsible family man; at death, a calm, retired introvert. Is Joe in heaven somehow a composite of all these selves? If Joe goes to hell, do all the selves suffer, even the happy, optimistic six-year older?

In contrast, Hinduism asserts the existence of Atman as pure consciousness or witness-consciousness, reifying consciousness as an eternal self.

Because as long as we’re alive, and from the moment of birth, we’re subject to literally anything of all the horrors, sufferings, afflictions, illnesses and bad things that can ever be experienced. And sure there is good in life too, but I’m not always convinced that the good outweighs the bad.

We’re born, we get the sudden chance to build a life, build connections and attachments to other people, attachments we don’t want to part from. We form a personality and a body and we even become attached to our own existence and body. We don’t want to leave it. Then literally any moment we’re robbed of ALL of it. Everything we ever worked to build, have, possess, are. Everything crushed to nothing like we never existed at all, including our precious body.

1699630568.0,Borderline Consciousness,"Hello! This is my first time ever posting  anything on Reddit, but it seems a good opportunity to do so.

I’m in the process of creating a paper for my philosophy of mind class and the (incomplete) thesis I’m exploring is the idea that consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomenon. A rock is not conscious and I am not conscious, but there is no discrete border between the conscious and non-conscious.

My first main argument in favor of this idea is rooted in evolution. The evolution argument is basically just a chicken-egg argument in regard to consciousness. 

1. At some point in my ancestral history, there was a non-conscious being 
2. I am currently conscious(I think)
3. It’s counterintuitive to think that a being’s parent could be non-conscious and its child be conscious 
4. C: Consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomena, it emerges gradually.

My second main argument is based on the concept of emergent properties.

1. We are made up of many non-complex, non-conscious materials
2. In the assembly of all of these materials into a conscious being, it seems absurd to think one single atom or molecule would shift the being from non-conscious to conscious
3. C: Consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomenon, it emerges gradually.

I’m also planning on constructing an argument around birth and death, but that isn’t fleshed out yet.

I would really appreciate help/advice with a few things.

1. How are these arguments, is there anything essential about either point that I’ve missed?
2. What are some potential counter arguments that I should consider?
3. Are there any sources I should I look at that would help me with either my arguments or counter arguments?
4. What do you think of this overall argument?

Unrelated to the paper, I’d love to hear how people think this idea fits into existentialist or other philosophical frameworks. I’ve recently learned about epiphenomenalism and find it to be an incredible theory of the mind. I think it really aligns well with this argument, and I was also wondering how people feel about epiphenomenalism in regard to existentialism?",1

1699574982.0,Is there a scientific explanation to this?,"This is my first time posting anything on Reddit. I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit, but as somebody who frequently contemplates existential topics, I feel it might be of some use to some of you. 7 years ago I had an encounter that I can't figure out. This is something that has been on my mind for 7 years and I have contemplated and gone through it over and over in my own mind since it happened and it still stumps me.

Before I get into the details I want to get a few things straight. I'm not a religious nut, neither am I a staunch atheist (and I also want to make it clear I would never hold either those things against somebody...unless they were total nutters lol). I enjoy the exploration of 'deep' topics, but I would absolutely never consider myself a philosopher or somebody that has an in-depth knowledge of science or the human mind and what it is capable of. I like to have an objective perspective on life, with room to contemplate and appreciate what an incredible thing life is regardless of how or why we're here.

Okay that all sounds a little deep, but I feel I have to get it out of the way before I get to the meat of this post. 7 years ago I was in my second year of university in Manchester (UK) and living with one of my best friends from school (Harry). This was during an particularly turbulent part of my life, but in retrospect a care-free and enjoyable one. Myself and my friend would spend time playing video games, going to the pub, waking up late...basically your typical student life in the UK (which of course included the end of term stressed catch up of work and exams).

One evening myself and my friend Harry were chatting over a cup of tea, the pair of us on our own arm chairs. Though plenty of evenings were spent drinking, this particular one was a sober one and it was no different than most weekdays. For some reason or another we got on to the topic of God, belief, afterlife, atheism, etc. This wasn't something completely out of the ordinary and wasn't a topic we hadn't already covered in conversation as friends before.

After about 5 minutes of chatting, contemplating etc, what I can only describe as an overwhelming feeling of comfort, joy and warmth fell over me. It felt like a deep feeling of peace had washed over me and I was bathing in what felt like the warmth you'd feel sat in the sun on a warm summers day.

Now I'd objectively put this down to some obvious explanation, but as it was happening I looked over to Harry who's eyes were wide open and shocked and he simply said ''do you feel that'', with this sense of fear in his voice. I couldn't believe that we both felt this overwhelming feeling at the same time. It lasted a good 5/10 minutes before disappearing as quick as it arrived.

This obviously all sound like the ramblings of a mad man (believe me I understand if you think that), but I swear on my life this was absolutely something that happened. It still stumps me, intrigues me and escapes me in terms of finding an answer. The feeling was so overwhelming that I've often doubted that I felt it at all, but having got back in touch witch Harry he assures me it was absolutely as real as he felt it.

(I have to quickly make it clear there was a third friend present who wasn't involved with the conversation and who felt nothing).

I just want to open this to questions and contemplations about what this could be/mean? Again, I'm not trying to push any religious ideology or trying to turn convert anybody to a belief. This was just a feeling I felt of overwhelming power, but clearly positive and comforting to me at the same time and I've been unsure of how to deal with it. This isn't something that clouds every thought or something that I think about every waking minute, but it is something crosses my mind from time to time and I think ''hmm, that was strange''.

My father passed away two weeks back from sudden, silent heart failure. This came as the biggest shock in all our lives. Me, my brother, my mom. We are still not able to absorb this. We look at his photo, and we still can’t believe something like this has happened.

&#x200B;

We all slept on a happy note the night before. And in fact, after a long time, we all were so happy, sharing our day’s happenings to one another. We have since then, been remembering his memories.

&#x200B;

I do daily meditations and read a lot of stuff on spirituality, including death; and that we all are mortal, and that we all will be dead on day, was like something that I thought, I was prepared for. If something unfortunate does happen, I will be able to accept it immediately and then move on easily. But my father’s death brought about a lot of realisations in me. This life is so fragile?!! He always stood as a pillar in our lives. It was like – no matter what happened, there was somebody who won’t let anything happen to us. Now that he is no more, we are feeling like we have been left all alone in this this vast world! It’s as if we have lost the roof above us, that protected us!

&#x200B;

Is this life so fragile?! I am still wondering. Somebody who had so many dreams, can go in just two hours, leaving everybody else behind?!!

&#x200B;

Why do we keep running behind all materialistic things all our life? Is this all there is to life? I have been able to see life more deeply and closely now. I feel like responding more consciously to people around. 

One person who is present today, we may not be able to see him tomorrow! I have seen him cremated before my eyes. Somebody who was all well and active, can become ashes in mere 6-7 hours?

For example, my solipsistic thoughts started to become an issue when I realized through direct experience that there is no barrier between the subject (I) an apparent objects out there (trees, humans, cups, ...)

It might not be logical to infer that it means those objects are you, but noticing this perceptual filter can open the door to solipsism for someone.

1699515717.0,Simulation Theory is taking the metaphor too literally,"Are you able to discern the difference between a dream and the waking world? Sure the surreality of your dreams or worst nightmares from a limited subjective perspective given an actuality into the world we all share may inspire a dreamlike surreality uncanny atmosphere that makes mundane moments seem poetic and given impossible amount of importance.

I have suspected that misinformation is fed to examine from a sociological level it’s spread digestion and acceptance as truth to a discernible level to the average citizen for the security of the fate of mankind and not its downfall when it’s safest and before it is absolutely vital to have mastered the almost impossible task of pursuing an objective standard while only being able to perceive your own subjective point of view.

In a dream you are clouded with a narrow realm of thought and perspective so much so it’s unlikely you are aware at the time that life does not add up to coherence beyond a sort of visceral or symbolic metaphorical experience that pushes a sort of deeper truth into your gut that you can’t shake off once your waking self is aware that in the dream world there is absolutely no sense of continued narrative experienced linearly with a few fade to blacks for sleepy time. There is so much more detail and critcal thought and fullness in reality than the place where the metaphor is the message but not the existence that exits within the world outside our physical bodies and minds that we sense and even feel and even intuit or use a kind of God given sixth sense.

Everything is an influence on its immediate surroundings as Newton said every action has an equal reaction either physical spiritual or through karma across the universe bending reality to its influence. It almost seems as if we’re slaves to the first uncaused cause or the prime mover or the unmoved mover, as the domino theory or butterfly effect would articulate but we choose how we communicate or utilize or redirect that energy that can not be destroyed but pointed. To me free will is fundamental and sometimes in the best case scenario is the highest hope that a divine power could trace or your acceptance and choice and objective succeess at least chasing an impossible expectation. At least that is what I hope. To me to will happiness and joy and fullness of life to those that love you truly and not with false pretenses but with the true hard reality of true love is not chains but an enjoyment and a learning experience.

To go a little deeper into some of my esoteric thoughts. Dark matter is the physical weight of spiritual invisible God, and it our belief and our virtues that strengthen him in an almost all powerful but objectively more than we could ever grasp. 

Whatever is behind this universe that kind of crafted this one is not Windows 95 but some fundamental force like chaos that willed its existence from complete nothingness that some intelligent design from pure accident of uninfluenced randomness experienced a glimpse of a song or melody so beautiful it gave purpose to all that sufffering that is fundamentally more likely in complete chaos than a perfectly tuned universe. That reality is not more real than the reality we exist in but must be at the very least in a much emptier space where the fundamental powers take complete focus to control and is more like wind or electricity or cosmic fog.

In my opinion the human race might be the most important in the entire to fundamental stability of the existence of conscience.

1699454159.0,Death Is a Process of Disintegration,"Many existentialists focus on death, and many view it as the ultimate harm. But just what is death? When we use that word, it’s not the biological death of the body that we tend to focus on, but the threat of the dissolution of the self, which, not coincidentally, is the center of value. The self is the I, the subject of experience and the agent of action. It is the embodied I that experiences and shapes the environment. 

Death is the process by which the self disintegrates. We spend a lifetime developing skills, achieving a social status, acquiring objects, interacting with others, experiencing sensations and explaining them through concepts. We create a map of the world through this throughout our lives. 

Death unravels our being in the world by disintegrating us, the self. The capacity to move diminishes. Nerve conduction speeds slow, and along with them, the speed of thought, and other physical capacities. Bones become brittle and eventually break. The immune system declines, opening the way to opportunistic infections. Long-standing threats gain a foothold through increasing vulnerabilities. Various disabilities and illnesses compound. 

Eyesight and the acuity of hearing diminish. Our appearance changes. People don’t want to be around us as much. We become cognitively inflexible and repetitive. If we live long enough, we become so impaired as to be unrecognizable, and so many others we knew will have died by then that the world will seem foreign, cold, and frightening, in any case—a world that has moved on without us, in which we exist increasingly as an historical relic and stranger, and one eager to be rid of us to make way for the new, the replacements. 

A lifetime of thinking about the value and meaning of life comes to naught. One’s focus shifts to surviving another day without crippling pain and labored breathing. There will be no final vacation. It’s too late for that. Money can no longer buy the things we desire most: health and time. We know that there is no way out for us, and wonder if some philosophers and neuroscientists were right, after all, that the self is an illusion created by temporarily integrated subsystems of the brain and the rest of the body. 

At some point, the damage accrued to the body, up until now a set of small fractures, breaks precipitously into a crack in the dam of the body. There is very little time now, and no escape. The disintegration of bodily borders is imminent. 

Panic erupts. The borders of the self have been breached. We break out in a cold sweat as we feel chest pain that we know signals a fatal heart attack. Every bodily behavior now, both autonomous and voluntarily, is focused on survival. The external world recedes completely, replaced by the sensation of our growingly erratic heartbeat. 

Our legs have grown numb. We can no longer feel them. Our skin has turned to ice. Attempting to breathe brings a stabbing pain. The lights overhead seem to tremble as dizziness confuses our perceptions. And then, nothing. No awareness. We have disappeared, even if the body continues its unstoppable journey down a mountain at frightening speed for a while longer. 

It is at this point that neither reason nor religion can inform the living where (if anywhere) the departed has gone. Whether to an afterlife or extinction—of course, we’re convinced of the latter—we cannot know. We instinctively recoil at the sight of a dead body and retreat, backward, out of the death room, into warmth and light, our values, the comfort of others, the busyness of preparations to make, and the rush of life that embraces us in its current and propels us inexorably forward. Just as the torch of one life is extinguished, it burns brightly in other selves, as the cycle of life renews itself, aware of the echoes of its history, but too titillated by the dreams of its future to listen too closely to them. 

Be here now. Do what you love. You are both part of the canvas of life and a painter. Paint a self worthy of your highest values. And live so fully that when death finally comes to claim you, as Nikos Kazantzakis said, leave it with nothing but a burned-out castle.",1

I’ll try to explain.

When I was rying to comprehend and imagine how “forever” will feel. Someone on here said “to close your eyes and count to 1, that’s how long forever will feel”.  I’ve found this very interesting and it stuck with me. It makes sense. There’s no sense of time in death, and so wouldn’t know we’re out forever or sense any of the time passing.

So basically, what terrifies me is. For example you’re at the ER about to die go into cardiac arrest or something. All those people are there, it’s 2023. Then you go into code and die. And basically from the moment you close your eyes and enter that “eternity of nothing”, you are basically transported across decades, centuries, millenia and even trillions of years forward. All while a moment ago it was 2023 and you were at an ER room and everyone you knew was still alive.

Then a “moment” later it’s trillions of years away and there’s no humans just some very strange robotic world and everyone is dead. All in a matter of seconds as when you die and disconnect from consciousness time takes on a new form. Like for instance if someone who died 1500 years ago woke up in their grave, it wouldn’t feel to them like they were dead for 1500 years but only like they woke up straight away with no time having passed, just like surgery.

I don't often get lost in the nihilism (except when I do), but a combination of failures and poor answers around my own identity had me in a deep depression. This may come across quite dark, but I visualized what would happen if I died, and what if I was wrong?

I wanted to provide an outlet for all of the societal ills, the struggle around self-acceptance and the nihilism when I can't find my way out of my own head. This was the catalyst for Processing, a comic story that explores belief systems, identity and grief through a personal lens.

You can read it here: [https://createdbyclyde.substack.com/p/index-processing-and-other-comics](https://createdbyclyde.substack.com/p/index-processing-and-other-comics)

The story follows the death of Clyde, waking up in a place called the department of Processing - where people go when they didn't believe in anything in life. It turns out that all afterlives exist. Everywhere that people believed were real in life, do in fact, exist. The department gives Clyde a second chance to find a place of eternal bliss, since his logical brain failed him in life. As one might expect, deep thinkers like Albert Camus, Friedrich Nietzsche, Herbert Marcuse and many others were inspirations in this story and my overall world view.

A core idea of the book is that our belief systems inform not only where we go after we die, but the hierarchy we desired in life. If death is merely a continuation of those belief systems, we are doing ourselves a disservice not trying to find a state of bliss now. This project has been quite fulfilling to work on, and I spend my free time building out additional pages when I can. It has been cathartic and keeping the void at bay.

1699360716.0,crippling fear of not existing after death,"I'm 15 and recently I've been struggling with extreme eco-anxiety and doom scrolling about the end of the world ect. I saw my psychologist about it and it slowly died down. (Of course I still think about it regularly, however it doesnt affect my day to day life as much anymore). 

Anyway, a couple weeks back my anxiety conjured a new fear to take over my entire mindset. I was thinking about the afterlife and death, and realised the most likely/scientific thing that happen's afetr death is nothing. for some reason I'd never really thought about it. Now this doesn't really make sense to me. How can I just, cease to exist??? Surely I have to go somewhere. Obviously my body with decay, but where would my mind/soul go? I can't just not..be. I know it's all about conciousness and its basically the same as when you fall asleep and that thought terrifies me. As if my phobia of growing old wasn't bad enough, this is probably worse. And when you think about it, we could die at any given moment. Nothing is saying I'm going to grow old. People die young all the time. Especially minorities, which puts me at risk. 

I seriously cannot doing anything without thinking ""why am I even doing this? whats the point of these tiny insignificant things in my life?"" This may sound ridiculous but I literally cannot keep this to myself anymore. Not to mention most other posts I found about this topic is adults having a mid-life criisis while I'm still at what some people call ""the best years of your life"" and I spend my days consumed by anxie†y.",1

The problem with this line of thinking is that to see, be taught, or otherwise understand the nature of everything, you need the ability to perceive, and, as we all know, perception is not reality. It is our interpretation of it. So even if we existed beyond death, we would still be bound by these same limitations. 

We understand the thought experiment of my red may not be the same as your red. Perhaps my red is your blue. But regardless of whether or not we call it the same thing or perceive it differently there is an inherent essence to red that we simply cannot see. 

Red is a wavelength, energy, but by simply viewing or defining it we are obscured from its true nature. 

This is true for everything. For example,  I am a person, but each person I know perceives me differently. There is an ineffable essence to myself that not even I can know.

And so, in the end, nothing has inherent meaning, it simply is. Life is either meaningless or given meaning by you, it’s perceiver.",1

1699249447.0,I Struggle To Accept the Reality of Death and Existence,"I apologize if I'm going against the scope of this subreddit, but I noticed that a few others have come here to get advice on dealing with death anxiety and existential dread. I'm an atheist and believe that death is the end of existence, and would be the same as what it's like prior to birth. I don't like that. I enjoy what comes with being alive, i.e., emotions and the ability to learn things. My death anxiety comes from two issues, the complete loss of mental faculties and the finality of it all. For the first issue, again, I like being able to think and feel. It pains me every time to consider a scenario in which that is swiftly taken from me and never returned. What's worse is that no matter what I do to ensure longevity, death still comes. Ultimately, I am not in control of my life because I will be unable to keep it from ending. I can't handle that. I could live the healthiest lifestyle and I will still die for whatever reason. I hate thinking about it. 

There's nothing I can do and I don't think I'll ever be able to accept it happening to me. For all of the time I may have on this planet, it will never be enough. As long as I can use my mind, there will always be things I want to do, but at some point, it'll stop and I'll cease to exist. I'll be nothing. My personality, my intelligence. Every thought and feeling will just vanish and I can't prevent that. It's not fair. I don't ever want to stop existing. It just hurts and sickens me to think about it. One day, any day, I might not even feel it. It won't be black. It won't be like sleep, because people wake up from sleep. There is no waking. I can't accept this happening to me. I can't, I can't, I can't. I know that if I reach 100 years old, I will still not be ready. How can anyone be ready for this to stop? I would rather hell be real and I be the most worthy of damnation because even then my soul will still persist. If anyone can offer any advice to change my thinking, as much as I don't think I will ever get over this, it wouldn't hurt to try and overcome these feelings. ",1

I'll start: Balance and equillibrium are commonly misunderstood laws of nature. Society fails to apply it on many levels, and when caught up in the extremes, they fail to see the easily evident flaws in their practice. Some examples: Science and Sprituality, both two ends of the same stick, yet the extreme ends tend to deny each other, creating the illusion of separation. Tyranny and Anarchy. Liberalism and Conservatism. Freedom and Discipline. Kindness and Harshness. Strength and Vulnerability. Power and Weakness.

The illusion of two seperate things, that are simply two halves of one hole. Failing to implement an aspect of that thing, leads to the direct, ""cause and effect,"" consequence. A sort of yo-yo act of balancing out. Overly strict parents often lead people to overcorrect and indulge in too much freedom, and vise-versa, until we figure out equillibrium.",1

1699139533.0,"If your depressed about existentialism, here is one solution that work for me","For years and really for a large part of life, existentialism has just bugged me. It has stopped me from doing things. It makes me question my reality. Questions like ""What is the purpose of life?"" or ""Why do we exist?"" etc. The answers I've always gotten were just null. And as a result, I have never derived joy, either a null state or just sadness. It has honestly just sucked all of the joy of life away from me. It has stopped me from doing my job, posting on social media and almost stopped me from finishing my education.

But my answer to existentialism is question: Why do we ask ourself these questions?

What purpose is there to answer these questions? It has severed no purpose but to put me in a metaphorical dark corner. All these idea of meaningless life, Sci-Fi books about human existence (especially the depressing ones), existence after death, etc. they don't do anything. They are a great talking point with some people who have this view but pondering these ideas and exploring these concepts don't give comfort. At the same time, it's not something that people want to talk about because its plain depressing. After sorta embracing this answer or questioning why I even think about it just gives me comfort. EDIT: I let my chain of though do their thing and it lets me release all of that pent up anxiety and really see life in a positive light 

TLDR: If you've accepted existentialism and it's had a difficult impact on your life, my answer to existentialism is just another rewording of many others in this subreddit: Just live in the present. When it does creep up from time to time, do not think about it but just question why you even thinking about (might take some mental conditioning). Go live life and experience things for better or for worse . Stop overthinking things. Just focusing on doing things and making existence if not better for yourself but others around you.

Note: I am coming from a privilege position, (not part of the 10%) but enough to sorta just enough to have time for myself. So if your in position where you lack the time and resources for yourself, this advice won't be as helpful.",1

1699117212.0,My argument for reincarnation and why I believe it’s truly what happens after death,"Reincarnation has been a belief of mine for quite some time. Sometimes I’ll talk to people about it and it boggles my mind how many people don’t believe in it. I can see the majority of people in this sub believe nothing happens after death. Of course we’re all entitled to our own beliefs. Whether it’s reincarnation, heaven, hell, or the void. I’m going to display why I feel so positive that reincarnation is what truly happens. 

So at some point, YOU didn’t exist. You were in a state of non existence. Then, out of nowhere, you were born and came to existence. One day, you’re going to die. It could happen in 5 years, or 500 years if we have some kind of reverse aging technology. Then, you will go back to non existence. You see where I am going with this? Is it really crazy to assume that maybe, just maybe, YOU will exist again? If you want from non existence, to existence, and then back to non existence, it only makes sense that you’ll then, go back to EXISTENCE! 

Another thing people fail to realize is that if you believe in reincarnation, half of your belief already came true. Think about it for a second. You literally came to life. Reincarnation is the belief that it’s just simply going to happen again. So half of your belief has already come true. However, no one has actually been to heaven, hell, or experienced the void. So reincarnation comes the closest to actually being real because we’ve already experienced half of it. 

If you take a look at nature, everything is always on a loop. Day and night repeats itself. The weather repeats itself. The trees lose their leaves and then get them back. People die and then people are born. The Earth makes one complete rotation on its axis every 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is rounded up to 24 hours. Even though time is a made up concept. This is why I believe so strongly that we will reincarnate. If everything is on a loop, my existence to non existence and then back to existence theory makes even more sense. This existence we live in, as far as we know, is infinite! 

This next section I know I’m going to lose a lot of you. But it’s ok! I also do believe there is some sort of afterlife. Maybe a temporary place we go to so we can figure out our next journey. Maybe we really can be reborn onto other planets. Maybe I’ll be reborn as me again but in a parallel universe where I’ll get to make different decisions. Maybe we will reincarnate into higher planes of existence in bodies that are more advanced then the human body. What if humans aren’t the final form and we just think it is because we haven’t seen what’s truly out there? 

The possibilities are truly endless in this infinite universe. The only downside is we won’t actually know that we reincarnated because every life is going to feel like our first lives. But it’s always made the most sense to me. If I am correct, to the person reading this, I hope your next life is better then the one you’re living now!",1

1699076156.0,I’ve come to terms with death,"On several occasions I’ve experienced what I’d call existential panic attacks, accompanied by derealization/depersonalization (mainly induced by cannabis use) which left me feeling mortified by the thought of dying and not being able to experience life anymore. Since I was young I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, even attempting suicide at 12 years old, although up until the age of 20 I never fully comprehended what dying really meant. The first time I knew the reality of death was after taking a heroic dose of edibles. Initially I just felt tired and fell asleep but ended up waking up in the middle of the night to a deep sense of terror in the pit of my stomach when I suddenly came to the realization that someday I’d be floating in an abyss unable to tell which direction was up or down, left with the memory of my life, constrained by the laws of physics for the entirety of my existence, practically trapped in a fishbowl called Earth. In that moment I seriously felt like I was drowning underwater. I couldn’t catch my breath just thinking about how water and air are all just energy and that I would eventually “drown” in oxygen so to speak, feeling confined by the glass of the metaphorical fish tank that I would never be able to experience the depths of the universe or live to see the year 21,000 or beyond. Realistically i’d be incredibly lucky to see the depths of this planet or reach the year 2100 in my lifetime. Before that I guess I thought that I was invincible, that I would be reincarnated or go to heaven but from that moment on I knew that there was nothing beyond death. I continued experiencing similar panic attacks after that, feeling so scared of the universe itself collapsing onto me burying me deep beneath the rubble, unable to escape my pathetic excuse of an existence as a mortal human but the more the panic attacks came the braver I felt. The last time I felt like that I came to terms with how fragile life is. One day I will die and be forgotten forever, but I am alive right here and right now which Is all I will ever have so I must cherish it and keep living for as long as I can to the fullest extent the body I have been given will allow me.",1

1699036797.0,I just need a little outlet for my thoughts :D," Hey folks, M (26) here. I've had a few things swirling around in my mind for quite some time, but I've shared them with hardly anyone. I'm currently in one of those phases where I'm trying to figure out my career path. Furthermore, I've been working as a freelancer from home for a while, but recently (mid-2022), I've had some concerns about what the future holds. The constant growth of artificial intelligence, changes in the job market, increasing inflation, and so on. It seems I'm not the only one feeling this way.

In my social circle, I see many young and older people facing similar issues. What professions will still make sense in the future and which won't is yet to be seen. Nevertheless, it saddens me to think that some of the professions that make us who we are might become obsolete. I'm particularly saddened that many of the creative professions are being replaced over time.

Depression, apathy, and a significant sense of hopelessness are widespread. People seem to be growing further apart from each other. I see many lonely faces (which I also count myself among) wandering around. Friends, whether men or women, talk about their increasingly superficial and senseless “relationships” while lacking self-reflection to explain these decisions even remotely.

In addition, excessive alcohol consumption is prevalent in my environment. I don't touch a drop of alcohol when I'm home alone, but as soon as I'm out, I consume large amounts myself. All of this has somehow worn me out and brought my “motivation” or drive to a point of zero. But what would the alternative be? Should I seek a new environment with people who wallow less in their self-pity and just forget about my friends, with whom I've already been through many problems? That can't be the solution either.

But this sense of apathy has not only developed with friends. It's the same with dating. It feels like all women are just walking consumers, not seeing me as a human being, but rather as a means to achieve their own advantages. I've put dating on hold for several years now. Except for a few short-lived, unnecessary escapades, there has been no change there either.

Why bother with something that seems hopeless anyway? At least that's how it seems to me right now…

I feel somewhat empty, tired, devoid of motivation, hopeless, and have a certain sense of purposelessness within me. Everything is so meaningless these days…

1698952915.0,Period panic from the utter meaninglessness,"Hello everyone,

As the title suggests I was wanted to discuss and ask if this happens to anyone else. I have long held my beliefs in existentialism and have used it as a tool for basing my values and experiences. From what information I have gathered, it is an extension of nihilism that states that every individual’s “purpose” or “meaning” stems from themselves and is theirs to define. I love this idea.

Unfortunately for me, this combined with my other beliefs will periodically transform into a pretty extreme feeling of anxiety. I am an atheist and I believe in nothing after death. It isn’t death I fear, but more so *change* from my current status quo. Combined with this is the realization that because we have defined our purpose ourselves, be it through internal or external factors, it seems to create a sort of mental loop for me that becomes extremely taxing over time.

As well as this, my biggest desire in life has always been to learn as much as possible and to understand the world around me. In doing so what ends up happening is the realization of how little we know and eventually the realization of the fact we will likely never know before our deaths, extending further the fact that we can never know truly anything for certain other than what we have defined. This again creates for me another sort of dread that taxes on me and increases my feelings of meaninglessness and purposelessness.

The problem only bubbles up from time to time, usually when there has been a big change or big shift that either has or is happening. The worst bits usually do not last very long, and usually just consist of “rabbit hole” deep dive into thoughts and feelings of extremely intense anxiety. I wanted to ask if anyone else here experiences similar “episodes”, for lack of a better term, and how you deal with these experiences.

Thank you for your time",1
1698945264.0,Life a constant stream of obligation and distraction,"Ever since I was young I’ve struggled to feel happy and at ease. When I would bring it up with my mother, her advice was always to find something to distract myself with, to keep my mind busy. I started to really resent this premise. The idea that in order to cope with life, we need to be constantly distracting ourself from the constant suffering that’s inherent in it. An existence where one needs to attempt to do the opposite of this seems far more preferable. To avoid distraction so they can revel in the goodness of what’s around them. But that doesn’t seem to be the case, at least not for me, and I get the sense this is true for most people whether they recognize it or not.

Often if you express these feelings you’re told you’re depressed, that something is not working correctly in your brain. But this feels frustratingly untrue to me. The things making me “depressed” are all true: the need to wake up earlier than your body wants to, the need to find something to eat to avoid hunger, the need to go to the bathroom, the need to endure the drudgery of work in order to not be destitute, the need to try and maintain one’s health despite it largely being out of your control, the need to constantly consider the feelings of those around you so as to not upset them, the knowing that you will inevitably upset or hurt them in some way anyway, the knowing your health and the health of your loved ones can and will be taken at some point in time which can’t be predicted, the need to try and be a moral person despite how nebulous that concept is, the list is endless. To ignore these things or be unaffected by them seems like the true delusion.

The brief moments of joyful distraction can’t change the truth that’s underneath them. It feels absurd to continue. It feels absurd to have been saddled with this despite never having had the option to opt in. (Let me note here that I’m not suicidal).

I think I had a question when I started writing this but I’ve either forgotten it or never had one to begin with. Probably more just a vent. If anyone has any insight or perspective they’d like to share I’d love to hear it.",1

Society has no intrinsic meaning, the goalpost of what is to be your cookie-cutter adult always changes, it used to be considered mature and the normal thing to do in adulthood to be a heavy or moderate smoker, now the goalpost has changed and being a smoker is seen essentially as ''selfish hedonism'' all of a sudden\[not that I am trying to encourage heavy smoking at all\]. It used to be the norm to be married and have kids at 18, now that's seen as way too young and a kick in the balls, it used to be considered honorary to enroll in the military right after grade school, now society sees it as something someone uses to compensate for the lack of a healthy posture of their self-esteem in one's self.

&#x200B;

The only things society does best at is giving you the impression of being cared and provided for, that still doesn't change the fact also this purveying can stop its circulation at any given minute, you rely on this illusion of society functioning forever so that they can grab you by the balls and domesticate your ass for nothing, almost using your reward instincts against you

**Because really the main driving mechanism of society isn't so much meaning and purpose, is escapism from the hardships and inconveniences of everyday life and our mortality as a people. If it was truly purpose, why aren't we working to discover more potential out of our so called universe and solar system? Why aren't we continuing to make more ground-breaking inventions and discoveries, even if they're small?**

I believe in the Christian God, a lot of the reasoning coming from Timothy Keller’s Questioning Christianity podcast series (would recommend). He mentions this in the series, but it’s less of a solace and more of a qualm for me; I believe in the Christian God, but rationally I can’t say with 100% certainty that He is the Almighty. 

I’m 22 and, obviously/hopefully, have a lot of time left to live, but it still feels like time is slipping away at an alarmingly fast rate. I find that I have these existential dreads twice a year, sometimes they last a few months. Christmas has become a typical time for this to happen. It’s the usual, “oh it’s been a year ALREADY”. I understand that being scared of death is wasting the time I’m so afraid of losing, but often I can’t help it. 

Two main questions from this post I’d like to hear answers on…
1. If you are adamant that your view is correct (any worldview encouraged), how do you grapple with the fact that rationally you can’t be?
2. How have you/have you come to terms with the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of an afterlife? In a more mentally sound state, I would say that death is unavoidable and the afterlife is what it is and there’s nothing you can do so don’t stress but right now that is stress 😂

I’m hoping I come more to terms with it the older I get. It’s no secret society likes to pretend death doesn’t exist, do we think perhaps that has helped aid the fear of death. Back when death was common (dark ages for example/anytime before the last 150 years), were people more accepting of it/welcoming towards it?",1

1698526393.0,"If you are afraid of death, understand that 5 year old you is already dead","If you are afraid of death read this.  A common response to all the posts here about fearing death is ""don't worry about death, it will be like it was before you were born.""  But this doesn't really resonate with a lot of people.  We don't know what that was like and can't really relate.

Perhaps easier to understand is that 5 year old you is already dead.  After all what are we?  If we are our bodies, know that your cells turnover regularly, so the body you have now is 100% different from the one 5 year old you had.  If we are our memories, well, your bank of memories when you were 5 was a whole lot different than they are now.  You remembered lots of things then that you don't now and vice versa. If we are our personalities then I'm sure your personality is extremely different from what it was when you were 5.  For the most part you would react completely differently to the same scenarios now as you would then.

So where is that 5 year old you now?  That particular combination of cells, memories, habits, personality traits, etc?  They are nowhere.  They are gone forever, never to return.  They are dead.  Sure, the current you, who is in almost all respects a completely different person, may have some memories of what 5 year old you did.  But that's not all that different from when you will die, and the people around you will retain memories of your actions for quite some time.

&#x200B;

Are you worried about 5 year old you?  Are they suffering?  Is there a great light of consciousness they had that is now snuffed out?  Are you grieving their untimely demise?

&#x200B;

Not only is 5 year old you dead.  1 year ago you is dead.  1 month ago you is dead.  Yesterday's you is dead.  1 minute ago you is dead.  The you that exists now is about to die.  Never to return.

1698526030.0,On Kierkegaard's 'Fear and Trembling',"Kierkegaard's 'Fear and Trembling' seems to revolve around the following concepts:

&#x200B;

 Is he referring to the absurd of Camus? 

The fact that Kierkegaard adds 'faith' into this relationship, confuses me. 

&#x200B;

* **The movement**

Is he referring to a leap of faith?

He mentions how the Knight of Faith jumps. He jumps from the physical world, in the leap he is with God?, and then he goes back to the physical world to which you can tell he doesn't belong to it, because he waves. Can someone elaborate on this?

&#x200B;

* **Resignation, in the contexts of faith vs no faith** 

He puts the example of a regular man who falls in love with a princess. He then exposes how different are the mental models and hence the inner emotional experience of the Knight of Faith vs. The Knight of Resignation.

&#x200B;

* **The Knight of Faith vs The Knight of Resignation** 

Would the latter be a man like Camus, and the first someone like Abraham?

&#x200B;

* **Infinitude and finitude** 

He seems to mix this adjectives in an inverse way? 

He refers to infinite pain even for that who has faith, even though then he goes and says faith will give him back that which he resigned himself in? For instance, in that romantic story of the princess and regular man?

Any supportive documentation you can recommend to get to the depths of Kierkegaard's thinking will be much appreciated.

1698470038.0,Fear to be everything,"I've had an hallucinating thought and it won't let me sleep.  
I was thinking about what is after death. Scientifically, the mind dies with the brain, so there should be 'nothingness'. But 'nothingness' is a meaningless concept, as if I am still live, but in a 'place' called nothing, dark and black.  
WHO experiences nothingness? So, I asked myself, what ends with me? Just a collection of memories accumulated over the years. But the universe is always there. So I thought: when I die I will stop being me, but I will still be OTHERS.  
The logical consequence of this is that I'm ALREADY the others.

I am everyone who exists at this moment.  
I'm four billion men and 3.95 billion women, and 20 quintillion of animals, excluding the possibility of other life in the universe. I'm everyone who feels pleasure and everyone who suffers now, and also everyone who feels nothing in particular. I'm having sex with all the most beautiful women in the world, and also with some of the ugliest. And also with all the men. And the animals. I'm eating all edible foods. I'm dying, I'm being born, I'm the doctor and the sick, the murderer and the murdered, the executor and the executed, the rapist and the raped. I'm the hundreds of people suffering and dying right now in Gaza and Ukraine. I'm Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. I'm Donanld Trump and Joe Biden. I'm a bird in a cage.  
I'm you.  
You are me.  
We are everything.

Now, why is this thought so frightening? Remember Schopenhauer's old argument: ""who suffers more, the one who eats or the one who's eaten?"" Pain infinitely outweighs pleasure. What does it matter that I'm having 300,000 simultaneous orgasms if I'm suffering even the most horrific pains? You can simply read crime news right now to distress yourself. In every moments mourning, terror, nightmares, torture, rape and chilling things beyond the capacity of imagination. You can't say, ""luckily it didn't happen to me."" In fact, it happened to you. It's happening NOW, while you feel safe in your room.

I would like my comfortable eternal oblivion back. Nothing, no thought, no feeling, no boredom. All solved. I will no longer be able to suffer.  
But if I am everything, then my suffering will be infinite. Sure, sooner or later life on earth will die out. But there may be other species in the universe. Sure, sooner or later the universe will die too. At that point, no conscience, no suffering. And yet ours may be only one of an infinite number of universes, like bubbles in the immeasurable ocean of quantum probability.  
Then every possible suffering, even those that are physically unthinkable in our world, will be realised. Forever. The universe would be something truly similar to the christian hell. And there would be no escape.

All this is too overpowering for me. I am looking for thoughts that will put me outside this maze, but at the moment I cannot find any.",1
1698451121.0,I spilled my thoughts and feelings in a lengthy piece. Curious to hear what you think about it.,"I contemplate a sense of superiority, though often labeled as egocentric, akin to a god. This doesn't negate my belief that we are all gods, creators of our unique worlds and individual lives. Describing myself as superior was an exaggeration; I am awake when society slumbers. Fortunately, not everyone embodies this perspective entirely, yet regrettably, the majority falls short. This is a pivotal aspect that demands transformation—a mere matter of opening our eyes. I don't claim superiority; rather, I'm disheartened by humanity's evolution.

Concurrently, an immense hope propels my endeavors toward a positive transformation. It's akin to escaping a prison cell; mentally, I acknowledge the escape, but I find myself within the confines of another dilemma. It's a ramble, I admit.

To derive mental well-being and decisions externally results in an unfulfilled life. I assert that the power lies within us, accidents notwithstanding. Generally, individuals spend their lives lamenting missed opportunities or comparing themselves to others. A death characterized by fear and regrets, rather than the intended outcome—a demise filled with pride and joy upon reaching life's conclusion.

Even if our goals remain unmet, persistently striving towards them is sufficient for a content departure. That, I posit, encapsulates the essence. Apologies attributing interference to others, even externally altering circumstances, are mere pretexts. Primarily, these individuals grapple with personal issues and haven't grasped the concept of a fulfilled, content demise.

We should not compromise our worldview. Perseverance instills a mindset geared towards pursuing dreams. Perhaps, albeit unlikely, society may collectively evolve through the dissemination of such knowledge across generations. Alarming suicide statistics, particularly among the youth, underscore the generational damage inflicted on society. It's disheartening that someone so young may contemplate opting out.

Meanwhile, others seek external validations for a sense of accomplishment. Criticism is directed at those who choose to depart, deeming it weak and absurd. However, the departed are justified, worn out by diminishing collective hope for societal enlightenment.

Finding strength amid passing generations, burdened by parental expectations, is increasingly challenging. The collective march towards mental hibernation mirrors a zombie-like state, potentially leading to humanity's demise.

In this delicate situation, I feel broken. Yet, a sudden hope propels me forward. Despite humanity's self-destructive tendencies, I commit to sharing my knowledge. It's akin to planting a family tree; if not initiated, it doesn't exist. Embracing one's beliefs is imperative; otherwise, belief remains superficial. Being is a journey; working towards becoming is intrinsic.

This notion varies for each individual. If pursuits are self-fulfilling and non-detrimental to society and others, external opinions become inconsequential. The challenge lies in determining what is truly beneficial for society—an introspective process questioning fundamental beliefs devoid of external influences.

Clearing our minds of external clutter, questioning ourselves, and embracing life, dreams, and non-harmful endeavors are paramount. Wishing for a collective embrace of such principles is essential. Stepping over others is not the path; rather, cherishing life in all its facets, good and bad, is the key.

This philosophy must echo through future generations, offering hope that time will bring positive changes. It commences with someone, with us, envisioning a future that enriches both our internal selves and society in the long run.

I maintain optimism in the possibility of such a future. Dreaming and striving come at no cost. Turning our backs on these aspirations is not an option. We are capable of overcoming challenges and fostering positive change.",1

1698322803.0,The hiveminds surrounding us.,"I recently read a social psych book called 
“The Hiveminds”. It was an interesting book about the nature of culture and its entity like nature. It had me pondering a question of which came first knowledge or the man. I mean there is no disputing that the laws of nature existed before man and so why would any other knowledge be different? So where are we pulling knowledge from? Well I would say it is not located in the physical realm so some metaphysical space that we can barely describe let alone measure. Now once we start to break down these domains of knowledge it starts to feel similar to a culture or Hivemind. It’s an entity like presence and lives beyond the limits of human perseption. Consider the Greeks or any ancient civilization and the large spectrum of gods. Each god representing a tree of knowledge for example Ares being the god of war. It’s away for people to conceptualize a collection of concepts. I have never been a “religious individual” as defined by current surrounding hivemind… but I strongly believe that spirituality has its place the hierarchy of needs. I see this in America in a lot of ways. People don’t have this need met in their hierarchy chain and with a culture based on individualism and isolationism they branch into uncharted territory of hiveminds and often leading to mental distress especially people who have a poor mental construct. Personally my experiences with religion had not filled this spiritual need as they always become a spiritual token board again just in my experience. As an analytical minded person I needed something more tangible. I am trying to shift my perspective to this way of understanding the hiveminds in which to follow.  Finding the hivemind, whose concepts are intended for the betterment of the world around me is my way of reaching spiritual enlightenment.

1698180287.0,Metaphysical and Existential Nihilism,"In Moby Dick as Philosophy (2015), Mark Anderson distinguishes between metaphysical nihilism and existential, or psychological nihilism. He explains the difference like this. ""[Metaphysical nihilism] amounts in brief to the rejection of belief in any metaphysical reality or truth. The second, which we may refer to as 'existential nihilism,' is the psychological condition of despair or depression resulting from the assumption that if there is no metaphysical truth, then the world is valueless and life is not worth living. Nietzsche approves of the first type of nihilism, metaphysical nihilism, and we may, I believe, fairly label him a nihilist in this sense of the word. Of the second type of nihilism, existential nihilism, Nietzsche vehemently disapproves, and he struggled to resist it himself"" (253). 

Because our culture has been implicitly built upon the idea of a God who provide the foundation for meaning, truth, and beauty, our recent turn towards secularism and atheism has left us vulnerable to what has been described on this subreddit again and again: a groundlessness, a lack of meaning or purpose, a complete futility in the face of what amounts to a pointless death. Even the faith we put in science has the same echoes of a belief in God. And we realize that not even a study of the natural world can shore up our eroding beliefs. Only now, says Nietszche, are we beginning to reckon with the death of God and what that means for our relationships and projects. We have built our house upon the sand of God, and our house is beginning to wash away. 

But the despair and nihilism I see on this subreddit is not existentialism, as I understand it. In fact, it may in fact be in implicit agreement with something like its opposite, perhaps scholasticism, which would maintain that if there is no God and therefore no ultimate meaning, then it must follow that my personal life is also meaningless. 

Existentialism maintains that metaphysical nihilism does not necessitate existential nihilism. The project of existentialism is to overcome nihilism (Nietzsche); to face our death, the impossibility of any further possibility, with resoluteness (Heidegger); to courageously confront and appropriate as much non-being as we are able (Tillich). 

This is my small attempt to remind myself of one of the essential moods of existentialism: a joyful Dionysian laughter, even while understanding that it would have been better to never have been born.",1

I live and travel outside by choice as a form of self discovery. I gave up everything I owned years ago. Yes I keep a phone.

He would even repeat ""iron sharpens iron"".

1698113748.0,I personally don’t think you’re able to unexist.,"Personally, knowing Einstein said energy can neither be created or destroyed only transformed, that alone leads me to believe that we go on in some form. Just not the current form. Since energy cannot cease to exist neither can you or me but we will however change form. Energy can never just zap out of existence the way atheists claim. It’s literally impossible for you to not exist after existing. Knowing that Einstein was right, knowing that we’re atoms essentially at our core (which is still energy) the question isn’t whether we go on or not, but what do we go into becoming? Just an idea to play around with. I do not speak in absolute on subjects no human being can give a confident answer to. You can confidently believe whatever you want . Whether there is an afterlife or not the living will never know, but we will all die, and when do we ALL will find out whether what we believed on earth was true or not. The unfortunate part is we have to die in order to find out.


Edit: I think laws of physics have been proven by those UAP’s to have laws we have yet to discover. A species that can’t figure out how objects can travel from 80,000 FT to sea-level in less than 5 seconds has no business confidently telling anyone anything about laws or life after death. We don’t know shit, we just like to think we do. There are obviously methods of propulsion that go beyond our understanding. Humans need to work on humility, instead of us acting like we have everything figured out. We can’t even travel the universe comfortably for fucks sake.

Nothing is what is. But nothing cannot be.

I call this the great paradox of being. This paradox must be resolved.

But it has no stable resolution. That's why there's time and everything changes. That's why everything dies, because nothing lasts. That's why everything is merely observed, and has no fundamental staying power outside conscious experience. That's why only models exist only ideas. That's why existence is absurd.

1698068840.0,Is the perceived separation of humanity and nature why we feel dread of death?,"I believe that we are part of nature and everything around us even cities and other man-made structures are also nature. They might have taken different forms because of our manipulation of nature but it is still evident. Our minds crave categorization of the natural world and have thus divided 'our world' from nature. Humanity viewing itself as destroying nature is simply nature moving in a direction that we can subjectively judge as 'bad'. Given that many of us can't do anything about the rapid loss of natural resources, we project a myriad of self-hate to ourselves which can manifest to   
 a fear of dying and I am no exception.

(I have no qualms with people who fight and advocate for eco-friendly living and am not blaming anyone for feeling an obligation to conserve the natural world)

I'd like to add that this feeling of angst is likely to have been prevalent even back in the purest agrarian societies but is far more present in modern times due to population growth and this perceived loss of the natural world. Nature, as we are a part of it, is a cyclical process that has no end goal aside from flux. Living and dying are human concepts that do not matter to nature. 

I think we can live more fulfilling lives by internalizing that our very being is nature moving about in space and time on Earth. We are both living and dying just as the Earth is. One day the Earth's core will cool but energy remains. We remain and are distributed.

Hume is right to point out that, through introspection, one *cannot* find any part of their soul/identity that is apart from an experience. In other words, *we* are merely lumps of experience.

Therefor free will is impossible according to science. He also pointed out that neurological studies show we unconsciously make decisions before we can rationalize our choices.

I’ve struggled with these issues since I was 6 years old, and now, at 17, they have become overwhelming. While I understand that death is a natural part of life, the idea of not existing terrifies me.

Most people offer the perspective that death is ‘like life before you were born,’ but that analogy doesn’t resonate with me. Before I was born, I hadn’t built relationships, formed memories, or developed an appreciation for life. Therefore, the idea of reverting to that state is deeply unsettling.

Although I identify as an atheist, a part of me hopes for an afterlife where I can reunite with loved ones. The thought that death might mean the end of my existence—and that my life’s actions would then be meaningless—disturbs me greatly.

Adding to the complexity, my mental health struggles, including ADHD and possibly depression and BPD, make these fears even more debilitating. I feel trapped in a state of emotional limbo. I want to seek professional help, but I can’t afford therapy and don’t feel I can discuss this with my parents.

1697507487.0,"On Consciousness, God, and the Subjectivity of Truth: Do We Really Know?","Consciousness is seemingly nothing inherently, as one cannot think outside oneself in a universe that operates without the influence of one's own mind. The universe, perhaps governed by a God, exists and operates by its own laws, regardless of whether we're aware of it or not. If consciousness doesn't influence how the universe operates, what is its purpose or value?

On the topic of God and belief, believing in Him provides a source of spiritual companionship through hard times. One could say that His presence can be a constant guiding force. When our paths feel solitary from a human perspective, there might be a divine presence offering guidance, comfort, and strength in a way that the human mind cannot comprehend. The nonbelievers of the world may say that God doesn’t exist because there’s no proof of him existing, which is valid. But just as there's no proof of God, there's also no proof that he doesn’t exist at all.

With these reflections on consciousness and God, I'm drawn to think about truth. If consciousness has no inherent universal function, then perhaps its value is subjective or intrinsic, which means that each person’s “truth” is subjective. If everyone’s truth is subjective, there is no objective truth or reality, unless one believes the teachings of religious texts and claims them as objective truth.

Lastly, there's the existential question of what comes after life. We’ll never know till we die. And even then, if death is nothingness, we wouldn’t know that we died. It's akin to sleep; it’s sudden, and then we wake up like nothing ever happened. Any thoughts?",1

1697455462.0,Kierkegaard for gloomy aesthetes,"*What kind of life is yours; do you will one thing, and what is this one thing?*

- Søren Kierkegaard

Many of the root problems for people engaging with existentialism revolve around the meaninglessness of existence due to the ""death-deadline"", i.e., the eventual endpoint in which our efforts take on a celebrated and recognised essence which we can enjoy others enjoying. While rightly terrifying, there is something in an obscure book by S. K. that people should turn to for a few reasons: not only to understand S. K.'s understanding of valorisation, but also to read people like Harry Frankfurt and Albert Camus *correctly*.

In *Purity of Heart*, Kierkegaard covers the idea of what it means to live (as Frankfurt put it) ""wholeheartedly"". When we desire one thing and one thing alone, the world is unified in an ethical worldview that we can navigate. For the depressed aesthete, this might seem like mockery, but there is an important lesson for everyone here: the purity of heart asks us to turn away from aesthetic essentialism and to become existential.

What does that mean?

When we are essentialist in our pursuit of meaning, we will turn the ""meaningfulness"" out into the world in objects that we can interact with. Much like ""A"" in *Either/Or*, all this effort and search for meaning is justified *only if* it can help us avoid boredom. But if you are at the point of entering S. K.'s ""ethical stage"" (i.e., you no longer recognise simple joy or achievement or even things like spite as meaningful *an sich*), then this fails. Why am I doing this if I will eventually no longer be able to appreciate it?

At this point, our understanding of self extends about the point where we are an individual which exists at various points in time. Can we guess why this is terrifying yet?

The purity of heart requires us to recalibrate our way of thinking from ""the avoidance of boredom"" to ""the joy of ongoingness"". We are existing beings, we are existential; we exist in time and should find the pursuit of the ""one thing"" joyful in-itself. By creating barriers about what we will not do (""the ethical"" for Kierkegaard, ""the unspeakable"" for Frankfurt), we open up the freedom to resist the pressure of the outside world. Our passion opens us up to successes and failures which we take on in the spirit of ""ongoingness"" - the pursuit itself, careful and methodical, is what brings value to our lives.

This is where we find Camus' famous ""one must imagine Sisyphus happy"" - the happiness is not a mindless surrender to our throwness, but finding value within a worldview that is existential: what we do is worth doing in pursuit of the *telos*.

But what if I build the wrong worldview?

Obviously, S. K. had a particular worldview in mind: passionate faith in Christ. He saw this as the best way to achieve what he was discussing. But this wasn't the only framework he presented.

In *A Literary Review*, he presented the 1848 revolutionaries as equally eligible for the ""religious sphere"" of life. This was because these individuals were driven by the purity of heart: what is must end and something new must be created. They were driven, ideologically individualist within a collective network, and effective on the backdrop of a worldview which they wanted to grab by the throat. In that way, we can see clearly that S. K.'s ideas aren't theological *per se*.

In moving towards ""wholeheartedness"", we must be willing to *be* existential. That means, in a funny sort of way, a scientific approach to ethics: we must recognise and accept the values we have inhereted (thrownness), but we must move towards the purity of heart by gaining and discarding ethical principles that we cannot reconcile with our *telos*. The meaning in life comes from recognising what is already meaningful and driving towards a concrete inward-outward expression of the meaningful in the ethical expression of the life of the individual. This involves choosing to ""transcend"" ourselves and the world around us in an effort to become more.

This, of course, sounds dangerously close to ""create your own meaning, find your purpose"" self-help vulgar Sartreanism. But it isn't: the meaning comes in grasping what we are without deception and chasing after the *telos* through careful and methodical ongoingness. Recognising that the existential meaning of life comes in the existential expression of the individual, not a concrete essential object that we put into the world. Reject vulgar essentialism, embrace the inward-outward agreement of the essential and the existential through effort itself.

I can accept that I will die, it’s a natural part of life, of course. I have also heard that the body is literally built to make death comfortable so I know that pain won’t be completely painful. But what I cannot accept is absolute nothingness and reincarnation. 

I love the life I have now, the people I have in it and all of my experiences. I cherish everyone in my life and everything I have gone through. I don’t want to forget all my loved ones and everything I’ve been through. I also do not want to reincarnate because then that would mean I wouldn’t have the memories I have with my sister, my mom, and everyone else I love. 

If Heaven is real, I pray to God that I see my loved ones. If the soul is real, I hope my soul will be with all my loved ones, that I can continue to be with them and they remember. I hope that when this life ends, I do not reincarnate. I am happy with the memories I’ve made and the people I’ve met.

1697406059.0,Do We Truly Understand Existentialist Philosophy?,"Hey there, fellow deep thinkers,

Existentialism, with its profound philosophical roots, has always fascinated me. Yet, as I scroll through this subreddit, a question keeps nagging at me: Are we losing the core essence of existentialism? It appears that we’ve drifted into a space where venting and sharing depressive thoughts often overshadow the philosophical exploration.

Don’t get me wrong; providing emotional support is essential. However, existentialism is more than just a platform to vent. It’s about the exploration of profound ideas that tackle the human condition. 

I’m raising these questions not to criticize but out of genuine curiosity. It’s not merely about invoking the names of Sartre, Camus, or Kierkegaard, but immersing ourselves in their writings to comprehend the profound ideas they put forth. I wonder if some of us are more inclined to use this subreddit as an outlet for venting and sharing our existential struggles, which is vital in its own right. But let’s not forget the rich philosophical roots from which existentialism grew. Perhaps it’s time for all of us to take a step back, revisit these primary sources, and engage in more philosophical conversations to ensure that existentialism remains at the heart of our discussions.

I’d love to hear your thoughts.",1

I remember knowing I will fade away any second now as the doctor said he’d administered it and the nurse was holding my face in two hands.. but I don’t actually remember the moment of when I was gone. 

Then when I awoke I was at a completely different room and was wanting the nap back.

I really wonder if that’s pretty much just like the moment of transitioning from life to death.. I just really would want to know I don’t have to be afraid. Of the moment.

Then I think as the social media boom of 2009-2014 happened, and then I think this is when people started switching from having a family or a sense of self as their aesthetic to now relationships being people's whole facade and aesthetic.  social media has made relationships, and really people's hobbies and work journeys more **gimmicky**, I think social media in the last 10 years has created a sense of socio-existential accelerationism, while not an official term, I think social media has given us a bigger accelerated sense of pace with everything including not just **relationships**, but also with work, pop culture, school & education and technological innovation, so it would make sense people try to create a sense and an illusion of their relationships being not only perfect, or perfectly curated, but also social media makes everyone act like their things are not bound to last forever, so basically creating the illusion of settledness, even though the average marrying age has been rising more and more each generation since the boomers, obviously I am over-analyzing relationships a bit, because they're a core important part of the human experience, but at the same time understand the existential drive behind them has changed so significantly.

After a couple of years of great suffering and working 9 to 6 - which may be the same thing -,I learnt about The Myth of Sisyphus and ended up reading Camus, then Kierkegaard, then Nietzsche and so on. Also Emerson, Thoreau and some Eastern wisdom.

A good analogy to explain my experience would be a cinema. You are in the cinema, carefully designed to prime you to get immersed in the experience. As you are watching the movie, you forget the characters are actors and that you are in the cinema. It feels so real, so intense.

I, myself, see myself in the cinema, I see the cinema and then I see the cinema within the cinema. And it all seems absurd to me even though I can see how deeply it all matters at the same time.

All the suffering out there, all the love. It is like a game but with very serious consequences and I just didn't choose to come here.

Take love. I fell in love, felt I would always be with that person, ended up breaking up with them or being dumped. I look back and I see all the promises made, all the I love yous and We will always be together. Bullshit. The love of your life today is a stranger tomorrow.

I just can't get myself to experience this world like I did before, in emotional terms. I am at a point where I go from a place where I am truly suffering - I have clinical depression - and want to die, to a place where I am calm in my despair and calmly think 'Fuck, I hope I don't wake up tomorrow'.

I really think love and art are the two things that give meaning to life. It seems quite obvious that we need love and connection to thrive and survive, but after what I've seen and the new way I look at this, I just can't.

Metaphysicians and theologians alike pretend to solve the constricting discomfort that this fact creates by sneaking in objective meaning or divinity to be worshipped (both are the same thing wearing different masks) through cracks of thought. But as children come to learn, all sandcastles fade away. Scratch into cliff walls all the scribbles you want; the bare stone faces do not care. And just as soon as the scribe dies, bludgeoned to death by his very own writing-stone, his enemy picks it up and writes blasphemy. Blasphemy is law, though. But there is a truth far more tragic than the goodness and life created by enemies: Forgetfulness. Nay, more: Irrelevance. The enemies, who were truly the greatest of friends, are stone-scratches themselves. Impersonal wind and air smudge their lives into obscurity. Unconnected and uncaring to the feuds and glories of the past, someone equally obscure finds the writing-stone. She sees the cliff. She walks on. Where did the meaning go! The Scripture! In what vase does it lie? Everything is created and destroyed.

You are withering. Look at your hand! You may be young, a bright blooming flower. Yet we also know this: When there are brilliantly bright flames, it is precisely the time they are dying the quickest. We are not fooled. Yes, we are all old. Incredibly old. Dying. Our world, parallel to and created within us, dies too. All the thinkers pretend. They cannot cope with the fact that their meanings and morals and wonderful conjectures are more like tattoos they drew on themselves, not part of the biology of the universe. When all that beautiful thought withers away, how good will it be for us? No good. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. There is no one for it to be good for. Arrows shot, but there never was a target.

Arrows shot. Arrows shot! Despair is certain. Pain— objectively certain. Death— metaphysically certain. But aren’t we describing the athlete? She labors and endures in her race, on and on, pushing and fighting, and she meets a mark. She created this mark. She goes again, the goal is raised. Dutiful suffering, and she fails. She goes again. Failure. Again. Many failures. But somehow, there is marginal improvement. Suffering ensues, and she makes it! Success! The mark is raised. This process repeats until she can no longer run. Is she in despair? Maybe— surely every now and then, for she is human. Pain? A reliable enemy and friend. But there is a mystery, a glimmering curiosity in the sea of futility: She is satisfied. She rebelled. An absurd respect is adorned over her neck; the golden medal that she forged.

Philosophies wither, and God fades, yet the pinkness in the clover lasts only for a beautiful instant— so do not miss it! And why would you walk away from this wonderful playing field; this wonderful deathbed? You might encourage others to be blind to temporal excellence; such a deed may be the only immorality.

I’m about 22 weeks pregnant now and for the past two months i’ve been experiencing severe anxiety. I’m already on medication. i’ve attempted twice to get in contact with a therapist and haven’t had any success. i’m currently trying again now. back to the point. 
I have been having such bad anxiety about EVERYTHING. I’ve read posts and articles on existential anxiety, depersonalization, depression, antenatal anxiety. i’ve tried to find different coping tactics but nothing is working.

I’m terrified of growing older, terrified to live life, terrified of time, not feeling connected to anything. at the beginning of this pregnancy i had to put down two of my life long dogs, and i think that’s where the thought of death sparked and i have been in a downward spiral since. I’m terrified of losing my grandparents, my parents, my siblings, my fiancé. I’m terrified that i’m giving my child life & that time will fly by. i’m terrified that one day she will have to experience this. 
It’s gotten to the point where i literally cannot function. the second i wake up it’s on my mind all day long. it causes severe anxiety attacks, where my chest hurts and i can’t breathe, feeling like i’m going to cry, then realizing none of this matters because one day i won’t be here. I currently am a dispatcher, and since we are short staffed and have lack of calls my shifts require me to sit in a small room by myself for 10 hours. With almost nothing to do, my mind just started to wonder. It wonders to the point i have extreme anxiety and these meltdowns in my head. i try watching tv to distract myself. 
i ended up turning in my two weeks a few days ago.

1697193075.0,My 22 year old existentialism on a Friday afternoon,"What percentage are we animals? We enjoy masquerading that we are beyond a point where we could be called fauna. We have a notion that we are more than simply living. As such, we train cats and dogs, send hamsters to run circles in cages and over-feed our pet fishes.

When I was a kid my family got a dog. We never took good care of it. Didn't walk it enough, never gave it enough attention and then mourned its death when it died at 8 years old. Ironic, isn't it? That I have the audacity to question why we find ourselves on a pedestal above our pets when I had such little respect for my own dog growing up. That dog must have had such a miserable life. Maybe I never opened my heart up to him because he was extra work. He was something that demanded attention and I understood at a young age that attention was a precious resource. That I could gain instant gratification food and games. My basic instinct was to gain attention and validation and I did not receive enough of it from this animal. If I cannot get the things I need from an animal, then it must be subhuman. They mustn't mind meandering on a farm and eating corn for years on end. Wouldn't mind being trapped in enclosures or having makeup tested on their skin.

I think a lot of people rightfully gain empathy for animals, but fail to inspect how they inherently are animals too. Sure, it's fetishized and linked to masculinity in pop culture in the way men and women are portrayed as predator and prey, but is that it? We view ourselves as such complex creatures that terms like ""survival"" are only reserved for when we are in distress or at our lowest. We evaluate our own sense of living above basic survival to the point where we are enlightened with post modernism.

But what if we were never meant to be self aware? Our bodies were not built to comprehend the idea of purpose. That we are stuck in a brain that physically can never understand the complexity of our existence. We are taught tools like mindfulness and meditation not to widen our mind, but to make it docile. We fear that falling into the rabbit hole of deeper understanding is to fall into madness. We are not built to contain this forbidden knowledge. We were designed to just eat, sleep, perform, mirror and procreate. We cannot truly learn this knowledge as we were never built to contain it. We call ourselves miracles and special and have listed trillions of possible reasons for our existence but we cannot look at an ant and see how similar we are to it.

I feel broken by this cursed knowledge and crave the simplicity of the womb. Where everything was safe, where nothing could hurt me, of pure bliss. I want to escape from my mind that haunts me. I don't know if I want to pay the cost for my mind anymore. I want my pain to be subsided but I am trapped in my head.

I feel I will never be able to wash away my nihilism and return to the womb. That is unless through psychadelics. I have been craving LSD and I didn't understand why. It was the only time I have felt pure bliss. I miss it. I miss feeling like life was simple. I miss feeling like I had my whole life ahead of me and that being an exciting concept. I feel like I'm suffocating and being taken over by an emptiness. Like one of a tree turned to charcoal. A second-hand shop's warehouse. A deceased Grandma's home before its cleared out. I feel like an echo of who I once was, but that my spirit is lost to the abyss.

It all feels spoilt. I feel like I'm in a gallery of my own life, looking at the art that lines white walls. Walking through the space, but noticing small yellow labels stuck on the canvases saying ""sold"". It feels like I could've had a life where I didn't feel so broken if it wasn't ruined before I had the chance to tame it.

What would you give to go back? Back to the time we were apes? Maybe to a time we were some wild form of sea life? A form of bacteria? A fetus in the womb?

What would you do if you knew you would never escape? You knew you would live a life pretending to concede to modern life. Accepting capitalism and war and politics and technology and retirement and taxes and science and art and job security and rent and Medicare and emails. Doesn't it all seem ridiculous?

I feel like I'm living in a play. I wake up at 7am with an alarm and go to work to pretend not to be a person for 9 hours everyday. I then speak to people I will never connect with and am accused of making their life more difficult because I cannot make the one thing they need appear in their hand. Some underpaid factory worker (living in a country you can't pronounce) made this item you are trying on right now, and you are asking me if they made a second one in your size in a specific shade of blue.

I feel stuck in a doll house, playing dress up, watching people act as if we have choices anymore. We are locked in these bodies in this society where we have lost ourselves to arbitrary rolls. We have stuck monkeys in suits and asked them to comprehend the reason for human existence. We then act surprised when they say the reason is that a bigger and even MORE complex human created us (like we couldn't get enough of ourselves to begin with). On top of that, we actually then decided to name this guy. Like how we name our kid Tim or our gold fish Bubbles, we had the audacity to call the reason for our existence God.

It's almost comical how cute it all looks from a distance. Simultaneously, how frustrating it is that everyone continues to play pretend. Like when you laugh at a funeral. How utterly ashamed you feel looking at the guests and it setting in that you disturbed them. It's exhausting being told to stop wearing a mask and to ""stop pretending"" and then actually being more authentic and feeling ostracized.

I don't want this anymore, it's destroying me. These thoughts feel like a blackhole. I try and claw my way out of them, but I feel the gravity pull me back in to explore. ""Maybe this time I'll finally understand"". ""Maybe I'll finally uncover why I act this way"". I will never reach the epicenter. I will be cursed to look into the depths and only find scraps of what I truly desire. I have overindulged in the devil fruit and have lost myself to the madness of the self.

What must I do now to live another day? How can I claw myself out of the hole and learn to merely orbit it. My journey will be treacherous but my body is strong. I will have to learn to connect my mind to my vessel and my vessel to this earth. I want to find peace.

I only wish that when I die I breath a heavy sigh. One of acceptance. I may never make it to that bed at 90 and have the opportunity to experience the bliss I have always longed for. I may be hit by a train tomorrow and have my ending cut short. However I go, I want to know I gave this whole life-thing a fair shot. That in spite of the turmoil, I tried.

If I cannot find the strength to live for myself (the me who is typing this right now, the me that is announcing each thought onto this screen) that I may live for the girl in the womb. The girl who believed she was a mermaid. The girl who played pretend with her brother. The girl who buys a rabbit when she moves into her own apartment. The girl who gets seriously injured in a car crash. The girl who reads her book in the sun. The girl who finds the love of her life. The girl who watches her mum pass away. The girl who withers away in a retirement village.

I feel incapable of finding my soul in my heart but I have to keep trying for her.

If not for me, but for her.

Yet, we were not too overly-modernized as a species in our social aspect, we knew how to banter, our social skills and cues were still perfectly navigable, we knew how to call out actual injustice and evil, and we knew how to enjoy the moment and not let the bullshit of media sensationalism and over-moralization get to us. It seems with the advent of the social media though things have gotten more divisive, sensationalized and over-moralized. Social media, the internet and the news industrial complex work together to fabricate societal ills for profit. As we continue to reach the crumbles of our current work culture, you wonder to yourself, when will we find our peace of mind and our coolness factor again as a species? It seems like thanks to the internet, social media and the news industrial complex our social and cognitive abilities are reverting back to animalistic urges, is gotten so bad people cannot tell real from fake, satire from real news and someone acting to someone being genuine and authentic, it is all intermerged now and with our declining attention spans, what couldn't we ask for more out of this disaster?

Modern society feels so soulless, so over-corporatized and so bleak, I do not see a way out of this, however my view of history being linear is changing so that's good at least.

As the title implies, i have no joy in living. What we call “life / living” is just reactions to external stimuli, reactions and stimuli which we arn’t even sure are really “real”. Life is a constant pain, rarely anything of true joy comes from it, and any true joy is quickly overshadowed by negativity, leaving “life” as just a cycle of suffering, in which we’re teased with happiness, yet are thrown back into misery.

Yet all we know about “life” is that we exist.. thats our only proof.. what if there is more to life, and just living… something we cant experience or understand because of our own spiritual, physical, behavioural, and mental limitations. We will never know what is truely real, we will never know Real Reality.

I believe life as we know it is unnatural - all our lives are, are various synapses and electric x chemical reactions in our brains, interpreting what we call information, and the hundreds of millions of years ago when the VERY VERY first life was created, before microorganisms and bacteria - the first synaptic chemical reaction - was random chance.

A random signal chain that continued to expand on itself, creating what we now call DNA, and Cells, and Mitosis, and Genus, and Species, etc, etc, etc. It was random

All of us are random, we have no purpose, no soul, we barely have a consciousness, and have hijacked our basic survival needs for pleasure, and commodity, instead of survival, and needs.

I seek no pleasure, because i need no pleasure, i follow no god, because we have no god, i seek death, because death is the only thing that can return us to our neutral equilibrium and NATURAL STATES OF NON-EXISTANCE.",1

1696968695.0,Nothing makes sense,"I often think about the universe, specifically how it started.

Obviously there are theories around the beginning of the universe as we know it, most credible being the big bang theory, but this honestly just gives me more questions than answers.

I get that before the big bang, time may not have existed in the way we experience it today (although that is a whole mindf\*\*k in itself), but even still, what created the starting point.

Surely there must be a start somewhere... but there also can't be a start, because what happened before then.

So it seems impossible for there to be a beginning, but it's also impossible for there to not be a beginning. So it should be impossible for anything to exist... but then it would also seem just as impossible for there to be nothing...because what even is 'nothing'. There has to be something surely?

When you really get down to it, nothing makes any sense whatsoever.

Even god (whether you believe or not) doesn't really explain this because you guess it... what created god?

However, I can somewhat comprehend, or at least come to terms with the fact that it will never end and stuff will go on for eternity. It just doesn't make any sense how it all started...

It the universe everything? Or is there a whole other plane of something that we can't even comprehend? Something that shares no resemblance to a universe or life or atoms or anything we can fathom, it's just something else entirely? Who knows..

I don't really know the point of this post and have no idea if it even makes sense, but then again, nothing makes sense so this is just as random and meaningless / meaningful as anything else.

1696932896.0,The absurdism of human emotions (Camus),"Hi,

I was reading Camu’s ’Myth of Sisyphus’, the part where it says ’The total absence of hope doesn‘t equal despair’ just like ‘Continuous rejection doesn’t equal to renounce’.

I was then inspecting my own emotional state and realised how absurd and non-sensical most of my pain and suffering are.

Take a dramatic break up. You understand the other person’s immature behaviour reflects just that, his immaturity. A negligent parent, the same. Yet so many people are traumatised by this.

I wonder what comes first: a faulty logic and then emotional pain, or emotional pain and a faulty logic as a result; then both enter a loop where they feed off each other.

How can we get out of this absurdism?

It seems to me no one has been able to. Buddhists say ‘observe your thoughts And feelings, don’t identify by them’, yet that doesn’t transform them. You are still hurt, depressed, and so on.

So what’s the way out? What’s the way to align what your mind knows with what you heart feels?

Now how people respond to it is a different perspective, but I have noticed more and more we're dealing with social issues as opposed to existential issues such as predatory wildlife, living out in the woods, trying to plow a field for food, etc you get the idea. Meanwhile we filled our pathetic little voids with social problems such as bullying, gossip, racism, war, polarization, religious proselytization and government corruption. The question is, where do the so called evolutionary, and in particular, psychological, need for this come from? My guess is that adversity can help someone sharpen their problem-solving skills, these problem-solving skills came in more handy when we were living in tribes, but in today's society where everyone says fuck all to ''community'', what even is the point? Adversity can develop a stimuli to that of developing psychological  and mental preparedness for future negative endeavors, there is the negativity bias at play here. But seriously, do people not know how to appreciate the peace of the ''present'' moment at all?

1696877798.0,"I hope this is allowed, I just need an outlet to talk about thoughts that have been making me feel very distressed for the past year.","MONDAY OCTOBER 9, 2023 (4:27 PM Canada Newfoundland Time)

(F16) I made a reddit account specifically to talk about these thoughts that haven't gone away for almost a year now for two reasons:

1.) I haven't been able to find anyone else online talking about thinking this way and if I can be the representation that brings others comfort of not being alone in this that I never had, it would bring me a little bit of peace back.

2.) Anytime I attempt to talk about this with anyone my age I often get responses from them being like, ""Woww you're sooooo deep"", sarcastically. But the issue is I'm not trying to be deep, I've genuinely been thinking this way for so long has brought me an immense amount of distress and it makes me feel very isolated.

One thing I will say is I'm bad with words, I'm going to do my best to describe my experiences but a lot of them don't have words to suit them. As well as I would like to be taken seriously more than anything because I've been internalizing this all for so long, if there is a part that anyone doesn't understand, please ask and I will do my best to. Also it is fine if you do believe in God, I do not, and this will include details about that, please do not try to get me to turn to your religion, I'm not interested.

So it started my sophomore year (im a junior now), around when I had started smoking weed quite often, I have no clue if thats what caused me to start having these thoughts but thats around when they started. I became dependent on it and went day in and day out not sober as a very bad coping mechanism, and after a while I began dealing with what I can only describe as derealization, there's no other word I've found that has fit it better. I felt completely detached from myself and from the world around me, I hardly ever talked, when I did have a conversation with someone it would be so difficult for me to find a response that I would end up just smiling and nodding. I could take in what people said I just didn't know what to put out. There was just something about everything that just made me look at it and be like, ""This is impossible, this isn't real."" I felt detached from my senses and oftentimes would just lie down on my bedroom floor and just stare at the popcorn ceiling above me and just think, thinking about everything and nothing all at once, about the fact that humans are just animals, how we don't have any inherent value over them, over plants, genuinely over anything even as small as a grain of sand--and that any value we think we do is completely made up because we were told we had it since we were young. By the end of the day we are the same as all animals, we just live a bit differently. Because of this, I can't view us as anything but just another species of animal, every interaction, the way people talk, the way they move, it just looks animalistic to me. It feels like we're not where we're supposed to be. I don't know if it freaks me out because i was raised catholic, always being taught that we were ""made in likeness to God"" and that we're supposed to be special in comparison to all of creation, but one day realized I didn't believe in anything regarding the faith so my brain is processing and trying to unlearn that or what. But just like imagine if you looked at everyone and they were just apes walking around with clothes, that's how I view humans, just apes.

Another thing I've been struggling with is the concept why I exist specifically in this skin at this time in this place. Like what were the chances of me being born specifically in the 2000's? What were the chances of me being born to my family specifically? What was stopping my soul from being put into a sea slug or an ant or an elephant or even a microscopic organism? Why was I born in this body specifically, what stopped my soul from being that of a Vietnam soldier or a young boy in Ireland during the potato famine, a Mesopotamian servant, born as a caveman before we had all of our technological advances? Like why specifically this body of any of them? Why was I born at a time in which we think we're so close to bringing most of the species on our Earth to extinction?

THIS IS TO BE CONTINUED!! I have things I have to work on and I'll continue adding thoughts to this later. Also I plan on talking about this to someone tonight who I trust so I will give an update about how that goes.",1

Why does it HAVE to involve some discomfort?,"Honestly it feels like by having become alive we got into a bit of a trap. We were fine, floating around in an incomprehensible, inexplicable eternal void that was sweet and embraced and protected us from everything. No good things happened to us either but since we never ever had a consciousness before, we didn’t know any better and obviously were just fine in that inexplicable state of “pre-birth nothing”; I wish I could understand what that state was.

But now we DO have absolutely everything to lose. Including our one and only chance to ever be in this world. Now we KNOW that being in that inexplicable eternal void means loss and it means missing out on EVERYTHING.

It means decay. It means disposal. It means decomposition, burning, cremation, and being forgotten. It means people being relieved without you and moving on like you never existed.

Since we have a full-on consciousness, experiences and personality and life now, it doesn’t make sense that we would have all that evaporate into god knows where and be re-swallowed by that same eternal void. Even though that void was alright before, now we don’t even have the excitement or anticipation that we will at one point be conceived, since at death it’s already lived, over and done with. We’re FORCED to die so someone else can live, and we’re disposed of forever like rubbish.

However, I am not at peace. And I don’t feel it’s because of a lack of internal order. But rather a hard time coping with others, societal, social distortion, disorder. It’s hard for me to engage with others, i.e. they are so chronically stressed and unable to just BE and can’t accept me just BE-ing, that it throws me back into a state of physical distress, particularly choking. 

Heeding back to the obstacles and fear I’ve overcome this past year- my father died by choice (he would consider it ‘self sacrifice’). (1yr 3 months ago) I ended up embodied a lot of his becomings. I would choke on yawns, I had previously learned how to ‘suppress’ yawning and the skill turned on me, to choking on yawning. My nervous system was shot.

I’ve focused on breath work and leaning into fear, and overall I’m feeling better and more ‘in control/ in touch’ with my embodied experience than I’ve ever known….

But when I interact with people who are scared, restless, projecting, or unaccepting of my awareness (&/or) boundaries… 

I have a very hard time being around people. I revert back to choking sometimes because I am delicate still. I become exhausted by there meer presence quickly. I can get angry (internally) with myself abt my responses…

And ultimately I’m mad at my body. I feel my embodiment is a prison, limiting, my brain has reached a level that my body is lagging. 

Further, I feel I have to ‘mask’ to function in society as we know it…. Like why did I ever want to step into this awareness if I can’t be accepted with it..? You can’t go back and take the red pill instead of the blue pill or however the rabbit hole goes.",1

I keep thinking about how once I'm gone, my essence, my soul essentially will be extinguished. I won't be able to experience the negatives and positives of life, and life down on earth will continue to move without me, and I won't even know it. I can't perceive the feeling of nothing because it's literally impossible and that's what scares me. You're just there, and then you're gone and you aren't here for anything else. You do your time in the universe and then you leave and never return. What's even worse is when the universe itself ends, there won't be a soul or any essence of a living being left anywhere and that scares me. The eternal darkness and how nothing keeps happening forever makes me shit myself. I can't wrap my head around the fact that nothing keeps happening forever.   


I don't want to leave, I'm so scared. What if people forget about me? Even worse, what if  people forger about me and I don't even know it. People will talk about me for a couple years, maybe even my kids will talk about me until they die, and stories might be told for a couple generations, but then I'm done, just like every other ancestor in my lineage.

A bit of a physical/metaphysical question.

In our Universe, if we can colonize the galaxy and unite in a hive mind and combat the laws of thermodynamics so we can exist forever, recycling matter/energy and avoiding the heat death of the Universe - then we would achieve the Absolute. However, physicists say that this would be impossible.

Can realities exist with less restrictive laws of nature (but still mathematically valid) that would allow for an Absolute to form and exist indefinitely? This would practically equal God.

If there are other universes that were there for like 10^10000000000 years, maybe some of them reached an Absolute state (if the laws of reality even allow it).",1
1696670321.0,How To Get Over Existential Death Anxiety?,"Hey, basically the title says it all.

I remember the first time I had a panic attack about death. I was seven driving back home from school, looking out at the sunset as my mom played music from her phone. The song was ""For Forever"" from the musical Dear Evan Hansen. And if you haven't heard the song or seen the play the basic premise is a highschool bully commits suicide after having done nothing with his life while one of his victims a dorky kid with a broken arm tries to salvage some of his legacies and spur a hopeful message of remembrance from his death.

But despite how hopeful the song is and how uplifting the musical is. I just remember in that moment, something clicking in my child brain that went ""Wait Connor's dead, where did he go? Is he still somewhere? Did he just stop existing?"" (Connor is the bully). And from then it was cemented in my brain that there is nothing after death.

I was raised Catholic and was told to believe in God and heaven and all that jazz, but no matter what I say or proclaim to believe, all I see is darkness after death. I get frequent panic attacks, mostly at night when I'm alone, maybe once a week. And it can be triggered very easily just by watching certain morbid subjects or topics.

It's not a fear of being forgotten or of losing family to death or anything like that. It's entirely selfish in a way because it's just an immense fear that I won't exist after death, that there is nothing.

And yes I know the beauty of death, I understand the need for mortality. Having a finite life is what gives it meaning. But I can tell myself that all I want doesn't change the fact there could be nothing after I pass away. Doesn't change this innate fear, doesn't change the anxiety and the depression I feel from this pounding dread.

And the dread is kind of amplified when I think about the possible afterlives that could exist. I don't like the idea of heaven, because it essentially means only feeling happy for all time. While basically going insane with no purpose because why do anything when you have all of eternity to do it? I don't like the idea of reincarnation either, because that entails you forgetting everything from your past lives and experiences. And forgetting everything that you are (in my mind) is effectively the same thing as ceasing to exist.

So any advice or hopeful outlooks would be much appreciated. I hope you all have a wonderful day, and are doing great.",1

1696612952.0,My theory on god and the universe,"So I was just sitting in bed about to go to sleep and as one would I just started thinking about the universe and god and purpose and the whole “what is life” thing. Well anyways, I was thinking about the Christian god and how he is said be in all of us and in everything we do, that connection with others is god and how all the experiences we have are all meaningful since god has a plan for us. Why can he not interact with us or do mystical things or show us that he is really upon us? When is the time in which he will come back to us? Well I think that our universe is simply like a book. It opens, there’s a story with events that is written which has an end, and then it closes. After it’s written it cannot be re-written as it wouldn’t be the same story, and thus why I think that the God of our universe is simply the writer of the story of our universe and thus why he cannot intercept or alter our lives since it is already written. This is why God in the Catholic and Jewish sense is said to be always, in past, in present, and future. God is everywhere since he is the creator, but he wouldn’t change this great book of creation. Since it is a book though, you can read it again at some point, so once our story ends we may just relive this experience again in the future when this book just so happens to be opened again. There are other books though with other authors, which would align with the infinite universe theory as well. Idk but I give credit to the dab I took last night for this, hope y’all enjoy.",1

1696540846.0,"I keep seeing death-related posts, but people aren’t mentioning Becker","If you’re not familiar, Ernest Becker argues that the inherent biologically necessary terror of annihilation is the ultimate root anxiety of anxieties. Humans, being temporally gifted creatures, can figure out that one day everything dies, including oneself. This terror is so all consuming that in order to survive, we build up systems of meaning and imbed ourselves within systems of power to repress the fear. Furthermore, we attempt to do something grand with our lives to beat death, we may try to live on in the memories of many (such as by becoming famous), we may try to literally beat death (trying to find the fountain of youth, cryogenics, supplements), or we may take a religious route (we don’t really die, we transition).

All in all, terror of death stimulates our need to be the hero in our own story, whether that means jumping on a grenade to save your platoon, raising the next generation, being a hard working provider, or succeeding in some grand accomplishment. 

It’s not a provider of meaning necessarily, but lays out the groundwork for what meaning is and why we care. It helped me cope with why everybody seems so mindlessly caught up in managing trivial things like pieces of paper and showing up to specific places at specific times.

1696534984.0,Thoughts that pass through my head every so often,"Over the past month or two, I've been hit by an existential dread more severe than ever. I recall thinking about aging and dying when I was younger, but it was never as intense or streched over a longer period of time as it isnow. I'd like to share what bothers me most when it comes to death and life's transience.

1. Realising that aging is just our bodies gradually becoming a weaker, decrepit, shallow version of our younger selves. Sometimes when  I see a person in ther 40s - 60s I get this picture in my head of them being young and vibrant and realise that all aging is is just time wearing down our bodies, making us slow, tired, less responsive, and as time passes we keep losing our abillities that actually make life worthhile, such as doing sports, travelling, making love, or any physical activity in general. Our cognitive funcition seems to follow the same path.  To cope with this we tend to make up all sorts of fables such as ""you start to stop caring about other's people opinions"", ""you become wiser"" and so on. There is not a thing in the world that I would gain with old age that I would value more than the energeticity of youth.
2. Finding out that there is no such thing as a peaceful death. Hollywood and global media has painted us this picture that on our deathbed we'll be smiling, saying goodbye to our loved ones, until a moment comes when we just peacefully fall asleep and die minutes after. In reality, the natural dying process is long, painful, and extremely undignifying. You spend your last couple of days lying in the hospital bed, not able to drink or eat, constantly sleeping, and in the very end you just lie there, with your eyes and mouth wide open, gasping for air, until you just shut off. And the worst thing about that is that those are your final moments. Your final experience in this one life you have will just be your body struggling to stay alive for as long as it can, and then it's done. No more you. I don't even think I'd want my loved ones to witness me in this state.  The idea of dying of ""old age"" or ""natural causes"" sounds too optimistic. The reality is that your body simply succumbs to the dozens of ailments you get as you age and are unable to combat them. My idea of a perfect death is something quick, unexpected. A bullet in the head for example. The idea of me lying in a hospital bed knowing that soon enough my consciousness will cease to exist forever sounds utterly terrifying.
3. Realising that time moves fast and everyone and everything I ever cared about is temporary and soon enough there will be nobody to tell the tale of me and the wonderful experiences I had with people I love. My loving girlfriend, my family, my pets, my friends are all damned to cease existing and once we're gone no one will give a jack shit about our memories and all the times we had so much fun together. Life is  just destined to have a sad ending. Telling someone you love them is just promising them that one day either of you are going to be heartbroken, either by the other person dying, or by you splitting up for other unspecified reason. One day, if you live long enough, you will be old, alone, or with very few living friends/family, tired of life, in constant anguish. All the while witnessing other young people enjoying the best years of their lives, not giving a shit about your sadness.

I've come to the point where thoughts like these follow me day and night. Whether I'm at college, at home, in a bar with friends, with my girl, at the park, you name it, these dreadful thoughts keep slicing at my sanity. The worst thing is when I go to sleep, and suddenly realise I'm bound to die and get that mini panic attack where my heartbeat and breathing skyrocket for a minute. I just don't know how to find comfort while being aware of my horrible, inescapable fate. I am not posting this to come out as special, nor am I trying to make all of you feel terrified allong with me, I just want to vent out SOMEWHERE. I wan't someone to tell me how to feel better.

Have you guys ever heard of Boltzmann brains? In a nutshell, they're a mathematical inevitability of the universe, in which given enough time, any combination of quantum states is possible - including human brains.

If that's possible, maybe our current brains are Boltzmann brains that spontaneously manifested with fake memories of our entire lives. But that's not what I'm interested in.

I'm interested in the possibility that maybe, trillions upon trillions of years into the future, MY brain will manifest itself, or at least an identical version of myself.

If that happens, as unlikely as it may be... maybe, from my perspective, when I die, I will be immediately transported into the distant future. And maybe this process will happen an infinite number of times.

If that is possible for me, it's possible for everyone that ever lived and will ever live.

If soul (or something) exist after physical death...

if this universe or at least this planet will end up disintegrated, big bang, supernova, blackhole etc...

everything we want or try to create, or todo, or posses etc, most probably guided by our survival instincts, even our need of feeling good another day and again and again, but it is ok as ours instincts demand it and that keep us alive and interested and healthy and feeling well.

and still, consider that, imagine that, if everything material ends, for a huge time, til a new material universe is re-created, could our attachment be our enprisoning factor leading our soul (or our something) to also degrade into void after waiting too much for this universe re-creation?  
Could not being attached (i dont mean being careless) let we find out more beyond this universe?

I feel very connected and grounded in this belief. I feel like I read a lot of others realizing this same thing and then feeling helpless but i just am more curious. I want to learn and create myself and nurture myself. I try to do as many good things for my soul, healing things like exercise, writing, meditating, etc. But where do I go from here? I feel like I just woke up and i’m a little lost. If anyone could tell me websites with articles about this side of existentialism or books to read that could guide me, or anything at all. I feel like there’s ways to see this side of things in a very positive light, but I am unsure if this belief system and be intertwined with others, such as christianity or buddhism. even if all you have to offer is a similar experience or guiding train of thought, please be my guest :)",1

1695937705.0,Determinism deconstructs Existentialism?,"I can't help but wonder that, if existence operates on a cause-and-effect chain of events, there exists no free will but existentialism states that we operate based upon our own will. It seems to me that we make sense of the world around us with science via causation and, if there has to be a cause to every effect, we are only deluding ourselves that we can act freely because we want to feel as if we do. 

Let's say that establishing a sense of purpose/meaning requires agency. If determinism holds true as a fundamental component of the universe and how we came to be, we can never act freely to create individual meaning. This means that it was determined since the Big Bang that the people we are right now would exist regardless of probability and every action we made in the past and will make in the future.

My question is, if you believe in determinism, can you still establish your own meaning in life? If you don't, what substitute do you have for determinism? Is agency still conceivable?  ",1

I've felt similar with regular anxiety but with much less intensity. It's like the purest, most polar opposite of the warmth of bliss/euphoria. I haven't seen anyone talking about it so I just wanted to know if it's just my body's personal way of making an existential episode worse, or if it's common.

1695847685.0,Who you really are beyond your mistakes,"You are not your mistakes. 

You are the lessons and the enlightenment that has revealed who you truly are through either your *moral suffering* or your *indifference* to your past perceived mistakes.

 A regret always reveals your true nature. Instead of rejecting evil and cowering that you can't beleive you acted out on it, embrace it as that which you are, that which has capability to manifest through you. From there you can reintroduce evil ignorance to love, to knowledge of itself.  Through this, you will be revelead to yourself. 

In existence, evil wants to be reunited with love, through you, and suffering is the balancing act of good and evil.. therefore as the buddhists say, existence is suffering at its most basic level. 

 A pure life is what everyone strives for.. yet it is in complete acceptance of the good and the bad where the truth of existence is born. Errors in judgement or mistimings happen, momentary selfishness or impulses, that is the nature of our existence, if you grieve a negative outcome, this reveals love is strong in you. 

You could live a life of complete non-infliction, right always, and that's great, but you will never truly understand through experience the scope of existence if you have never made a mistake considered undesirable. 

Don't cower from evil, don't fear it, understand it and acceptt it to its fullest capability, and then introduce it to it's one true love - goodness;  and from there,  you will be revealed for who you truly are, your personal representation of 'good' and 'evil'

Your true emerging preference will go forth from here. There's a reason ignorance breeds evil and knowledge breeds understanding of both. Evil is trying to find its way back to love. And through this union is true knowledge of both sides of the coin - the Yin and the Yang as the chinese culture suggested.

1695821752.0,Meaning of life?,"Recently in late July I got hung up on trying to comprehend that I exist and live in a universe that exists versus doesn’t exist. The thoughts were followed by huge panic attacks and feeling like I would just evaporate. 

As this progressed and my mind seemingly felt to be frying. I started to feel like I was going to die. 
Suddenly, I became fixated on my personal existence and inevitable death. 

At first these thoughts scared me but as time went on and my brain kept churning. These chronic thoughts kept beating me down. 

I suddenly couldn’t enjoy anything without consciously thinking what’s the point of doing anything at all if I’m just going to die someday. 

Now my mind started projecting everything as work. Wiping my ass, showering, eating, and don’t even get me started on work and paying bills. 

All of this work every second of living just to be alive when I’m just going to die one day. 

Obviously, this was terrifying and I began to search for meaning. I have searched religions, philosophy. Etc etc. I found that either I die into a memory less state of non-existence for all of eternity or I go to an infinite afterlife, source consciousness, reincarnation. 

If we die and become nothing I’ve found that people often pursue advancing human civilization. I ask, “why?” humans aren’t and infinite creation. They will cease to exist one day so that seems fruitless. 
So, I live for my family? That’s a Nobel gesture and I wouldn’t want them to be sad. But if I die into nothing then so will they. So no matter what happens to me when they die poof all their sorrows and everything disappear too. 

If there is an afterlife and my consciousness goes on forever, that frankly sounds terrifying. I can’t begin to comprehend “infinity” in fact I have “Apeirophobia”.

I have no desire to live forever. I don’t fear death because of a fear I won’t exist, I fear death more upon the idea of eternity. 

So, now I exist in quite the paradox. 
I don’t want to live forever. But there is a chance that happens. One can say that isn’t possible yet how the fuck is the universe possible. That just proves anything can happen. Yet, living day by day knowing I will die fucking sucks. I find many peoples philosophy to live is defined by their ego and they don’t connect the dots that if life is meaningless they won’t remember it no matter how well they live it. 

I suddenly have no idea why I’m doing anything. Idk why I wrote this. Idk why I’m going to work today. I no longer perceive all the greatest minds I looked up to as even aware. I find joy in nothing. Yet I woke up today breathing and my nervous system does that all on it’s own.

https://qz.com/866352/scientists-say-your-mind-isnt-confined-to-your-brain-or-even-your-body

Not sure I'm with this take. Maybe I'm falling prey to that very same traditionalist view of mind they're trying to transcend here, but whenever I see a post like this, it's just proof of how interconnected the mind is to the brain, specifically ego. These ""the mind is everything"" articles always sound like the stance of someone's ego running wild. 

It's maybe a bit of a defense mechanism. Because what's the main stance I've been assuming since I first got into existentialist philosophy? Deconstructing solipsism. Which, thank Bergson, Moore and Wittgenstein, and even Hegel [""the very fact that something is determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended"", anyone?] for being on that side too. 

So...enlighten me! What IS this exactly talking about? Is it accurate? Is it not accurate at all? Is it scientism? Externalism? Go nuts!

It just feels like I've truly awoken to the sheer scale of just how fucking horrifying existence is, and the fact that it literally cannot ever be escaped, and my brain is understandably going fucking berzerk and either feels the need to make me stay in bed 24/7 with my eyes shut desperately trying to blank this new awareness out, or drink alcohol until I'm drunk so I get even just a fucking moment of relief from this unbearable terror I feel 24/7 constantly, if I have to leave bed for whatever reason I scrunch my face up in agony and discomfort right up until I can return to my bed and resume lying there completely motionless.

I don’t really want to be cremated I’m terrified of it, I’d prefer to be buried I just think it feels and looks more natural and let nature do the work in due time of decomposition through decades and centuries. But I’m afraid my parents might cremate me in case I were to die, cause the cost of living is higher, coffins and burials cost a lot plus I think not sure though that they also want to be cremated. I’m just worried they’d cremate me and I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it, my body would be lost forever it wouldn’t even stay whole anymore and would be lost.

A buried person just looks like they’re asleep. It gives me more consolation although the fact that they put you so deep into the ground for it… why?! It makes me so claustrophobic. It’s so dark and airless and isolated. Like why do they put you into a coffin, THEN put you way down very deep and THEN even put a lot of dirt on you. 

I just don’t understand. Why not just dig a foot hole and put the coffin closer to the surface.. actually why isn’t a person buried without a coffin? What’s even the point of a coffin in the ground? It serves nobody a purpose. Eventually the coffin will also decompose won’t it, and it will leave the corpse exposed anyway? If so, why does a coffin even cost thousands?

Also, I think the reason of that is not only some kind of anxiety disorder, but my inner philosophy of trying to wrap all the world inside my brain. And because world mostly consists of pain, I end up being in pain. ​

And the only way to do that is to just accept yourself as a dust in the wind of the existance's chaos and live your stupid human life, but I just cannot function that way. ​

I was a happy kid, the world was bright and colorful, I knew what death was, but it didn’t concern me one bit. I believed in heaven then, however I was never taught any formal religion. Fast forward to a month ago. I was sitting in my room, studying for a test when suddenly I had an epiphany. I realized each second I was getting closer to death, a realized that my days are numbered (even though the number is a great amount) I realized that death is most likely nothingness for an eternity, like sleeping with no dreams, like what I saw before I was born. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I closed the tab of my studies and started researching what happens after death. I read articles after articles, a mixture of religious and scientific articles. I believed more in the scientific ones, which said that when you die your brain releases this chemical known as DMT for a few minutes which creates vivid dreams (which can feel like hours, despite only being a few minutes) and then after the dreams are over it’s just eternal nothingness.

1695337496.0,We as humans are nothing but organic creations driven by emotions," 

As the title says: we as humans are nothing but organic creations on this earth but emotions and intelligence (which varies) is what makes us feel differrent.

These emotions wrote our history and it's what makes us integrate/adapt & procreate.

You don't know yourself and you never will because your thoughts aren't even yours they are influenced by the people/media that you follow & what makes you follow is the thrive to feel included.

God never existed as we perceive HIM but He exists as a primal drive/feeling in us that works entangled with intelligence & that's why people that keep arguing over religion with science are just simple apes, because religion goes hand in hand with science, regardless of what you may think of me as reading this post keep in mind that God (as in emotion) drove the ancient engineers to create many things that drove to this point.

Heaven & Hell exist here and they are an result of our actions, emotions, intelligence and mindset but unfortunately we don't choose the circumnstaces we're born in

The people that wrote the books consisting of the bible were frighteningly intellignet humans for that time because they were mostly right.

To explain more simply how we as humans are inherently wrong of what we believe in take these following examples:

1)Imagine you are an cruise captain travelling the ocean & you encounter an whirlpool (water vortex) the sight of this monstrosity gives you an feeling of hell. but if you fall into it nothing will happen but sink into the water, something wthat would have also happened if you're ship suffered an malfunction.

2) Same thing goes for encountering an black hole in space, your mind upon experiencing this will go into shock but as soon as you get sucked into it you will fall at peace with the forecomings.

So struggling with feelings of worthlessnes/depression over materialistic & dumb modern things such as never having a girlfriend or not having the latest phone/shoes car or whatever is pointless nad pathetic but regardless of of being aware of this it will hardly go way since the emotion of being equal/powerful will hardly go away.

Imagine you were born blind, all your life would be different and you never would be aware of all this inevitable drive as long you will have what truly matter for you: Family.

You are nothing but the universe experiencing itself.

THe act of having a family gives you fulffillment and you do it to finally be happy and at peace, but you never know the path your offspring will take.

We are afraid of death but it's something very natural and for many to be embraced rather than feared

As the title says: we as humans are nothing but organic creations on this earth but emotions and intelligence (which varies) is what makes us feel differrent.

These emotions wrote our history and it's what makes us integrate/adapt & procreate.

You don't know yourself and you never will because your thoughts aren't even yours they are influenced by the people/media that you follow & what makes you follow is the thrive to feel included.

God never existed as we perceive HIM but He exists as a primal drive/feeling in us that works entangled with intelligence & that's why people that keep arguing over religion with science are just simple apes, because religion goes hand in hand with science, regardless of what you may think of me as reading this post keep in mind that God (as in emotion) drove the ancient engineers to create many things that drove to this point.

Heaven & Hell exist here and they are an result of our actions, emotions, intelligence and mindset but unfortunately we don't choose the circumnstaces we're born in

The people that wrote the books consisting of the bible were frighteningly intellignet humans for that time because they were mostly right.

1695316117.0,We really don't know anything about anything,"We don't even know if we even really exist in any meaningful way. Let me give you a simple analogy real quick. Let's say I'm Jack, an english speaker and I want to do business with a Japanese man who only speaks japanese. Jill my assistant speaks englsih and spanish. The japanese man's assistant speeks japanese and french. So we need a translator that speaks spanish and french. Every letter, every contract, correspondence, whatever, would have to go through those three individuals before reaching either me or the Japanese man. But here's the thing, the entire time I'm doing business with the japanese man Jill is the only person I ever come in direct contact with. How do I know the Japanese man or the other two individuals even exist? Jill could be forging every document for all I know. This is what the experience of reality is like. The japanese man represents the world outside my body. His assistant is my body. The translator is my brain. Jill is my minds eye, she creates the illusion of reality that I see around me. And I'm the inner eye that sees the illusion created by Jill.

According to Jill everything I see is true, everything I see is real. But I don't  know, how can I know? All I know is what Jill tells me. I see a lot of you people on this sub struggling with thoughts of solipsism. That's nothing compared to the actual reality of our situation. What you really should be struggling with is whether or not you exist at all. I really don't think I do exist. Sounds insane, I know. How can I make a claim if I don't exist? 

The way I see it I don't dictate my thoughts. My thoughts simply occur. Like everything else I observe my entire identity as a person, my thoughts, beliefs, actions is all just information that Jill feeds to me. I feel like everything is just theater. It's like Jill is the movie itself and jack is the protagonist of the movie. And jack has become aware of the fact that he is nothing more than a fictional character created by the movie. Before gaining awareness jack use to identify himself as the person sitting in the seat in the theater in front of the screen watching the movie. And whatever was happening on screen was what was happening in the real world. But now jack realizes that the theater is actually empty. And the only thing that exists is the movie. Which from my perspective is a very funny realization. Because I was born in the theater. Not literally obviously. A scene from 1989 ""Batman"" was my very first memory. So in a way it's like I came into existence in the movie theater. And the movie theater has dominated a large part of my life. So it's funny to come to this realization concerning my existence. 

But let's assume Jill is telling us the truth about everything. Because Jill has never really given me a reason to believe she's a liar. So why should I assume that she's a liar? I shouldn't. So the real world exists, I do have a physical body, a brain. And my consciousness exists trapped inside Jill. Well guess what? I still don't exist. Cause I am not my consciousness. My consciousness is something I observe outside of me. If it's outside of me it isn't me. I know it's a weird claim to make because it's my consciousness that's making these claims. It's like my consciousness is identifying as something that it isn't, which is the thing that observes consciousness. But it all plays back into my movie analogy where jack thinks he's in the theater but realizes he's actually a part of the movie.

Even if I were to assume that I am my consciousness I still don't exist. Would you argue that spiderman exists, or batman? They exist as fictional characters, but not real life people. Even if my consciousness existed in the real world I would still be just as fictional as spiderman or batman. Because not even consciousness dictates itself, I don't control what I think ever, or my choices. Its all just a long deterministic chain of causation. My entire identity is nothing more than a reflex of the original cause of reality. 

You might argue against everything being deterministic. You'd be arguing against a brick wall. I've seen glimpses of my own future. And despite not wanting what I saw to come true it did anyway. So I know for a fact it's deterministic. 

Maybe I don't exist but everything else exists right? I do have a physical body and the world outside it is infact real...right? Not really. It's all just fundamental forces compressing spacetime into virtual particles. Those virtual particles yield atoms. It's all just waves in a ocean of pixelated nothingness. Coupled with the fact that reality is deterministic you could argue that reality is indistinguishable from a potentially eternally long movie printed on the film of spacetime. 

Naturally the only thing that can be real is what is fundamental. Everything else is just fiction created by the fundamental. Jill is real and we're all just fictional characters in the mind of God. So solipsism is true, just not for you or me. It's only true for God. It's all whatever though, it doesn't really bother me anymore. It would just be nice if this movie got a happy ending already and transitioned into a neverending sitcom.

Edit: I just realized that achieving a happy ending would actually require me to move the plot of the story...one day. Hopefully Jill has written in some character motivation not to far from now.",1
1695304047.0,How can I ever come to terms with how solipsistic reality is? It doesn't seem possible,"Since last year I've been having these absolutely fucking excrutiating panic attacks about solipsism, I basically realise that wether or not solipsism is true, I will ALWAYS be stuck inside my own 1000000% isolated and lone conscious and stuck inside my own body until I die, and I'll probably continue being stuck in some way even after death, In some other form of consciousness, it's basically just a neverending series of getting stuck in different bodies and different ways

Like I'm never ever ever going to be able to ever stop being u/trrrsarescary, I am completely fully imprisoned and trapped in this singular isolated perspective, when this fully hits me it just fucking hits me all at once like a cannonball and causes basically the worst sense of claustrophobia ever, like being sent out alone into outer space, completely and utterly hopelessly fucking trapped, possibly forever, I cannot stress the level of fear I feel during these episodes, it feels literally beyond any terror anyone has ever felt, truly genuine nightmare tier shit, except it's real life, I have no Idea how I'm fucking still alive tbh, I've had panic attacks my whole life but it's never been *this* debilitating

sometimes it makes me grunt and moan in terror and fear, it's genuinely fucking agony and it's making me feel like I HAVE to end it, not because I want to but because I HAVE to, or else I'll just keep spiraling further and further into this terrifying realisation and reach absolute never ending psychological hell

The thing that fucks with me is that this doesn't feel like mental illness, like I am mentally ill yes, but this specific thing just feels to me like realising something truly fucked up about existence which I shouldn't have, like opening Pandora's box but to an extreme level, this solipsistic claustrophobia feels like legitimately dangerous Lovecraftian knowledge that I've really really fucked myself over by becoming aware of, I feel like this realisation is something which would cause anyone's brain to freak the fuck out and start self destructing and eating itself alive


I basically live in bed now because of these panic attacks, I hardly eat or shower or anything I just fucking lay there eyes closed desperately trying to forget what I know or just come to terms with it, but I just fucking CAN'T, it's too excrutiatingly terrified, to realise that I really am truly 10000000000% trapped in my own consciousness with absolutely fucking no way out ever

Up until a week ago I was a normal mid 30s millennial. Tech job in big metro area, not rich but able to live comfortably, lots of hobbies and interests around computers, cars, tech stuff, etc.

Being a bit of a space nerd I've had some past existential thoughts about the universe and where it came from, are we alone, and what happens when we die. These thoughts usually happen at night laying in bed when I can't sleep, but by the next day I'm back to my normal self. When I turned 30 I started thinking to myself: ""If I'm lucky this is 1/3 of my life, if I'm unlucky then hopefully at least 1/2 way there.""

&#x200B;

Then a week ago I was in bed on Reddit and this came across my feed and it has hit me like a freight train.

&#x200B;

I've also had these PBS Frontline documentaries in my YouTube Watch Later and finally decided to watch them:

&#x200B;

Huge mistake. This has put me into a full on existential dread anxiety mode. What is the point of anything, living life, making memories, collecting hobbies and stuff, if it all just goes away when we die.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have a small family, just my mom and dad (separated before I could remember when I was young), only 1 set of grandparents, and a younger brother by 2 years. I've also been with my (m) boyfriend (m) for a handful of years now. No kids in our plans as a gay couple with surrogacy being out of our reach for us.

&#x200B;

I still had the mindset like I'm 22 in college, but my 30 year old body is slowly reminding me that I'm not. I can also see it in my family getting older. I guess I'm lucky to have not had to experience any death in my immediate family yet, and I've never attended a funeral. But my grandparents are closing in on 90, my dad just turned 70, and my mom is mid 50s. I just know in the next few years I'm going to have to start facing the realities.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend has a much bigger and a bit younger family with lots of aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews but we're going to have to face it together as well eventually as they age.

&#x200B;

Then the ultimate dread, either I'm going to have to live through my boyfriend / partner dying first, or he is going to live through me dying first. And who is going to be there for us? Will we just be in a nursing home together? Hopefully not bedridden at least until the very end.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people say ""death is eternal nothingness, just like the eternal nothingness before you were born."" But in my head, we know so much about history of our universe, planet, and life on Earth, that even though I didn't personally live through it, it comforts me in knowing somewhat how we ended up here. That's why my brain can't comprehend what happens after we pass. That is the great unknown.

I have felt empty for a bit since I haven't ""believed"" in anything. After learning about existentialism and philosophy in general, learning that there likely is no life after death and truly seeing that as a real possibility is very freeing. Just because I don't believe in God doesn't mean that I don't believe in anything. 

Because I believe that there is no afterlife, that is belief. This life on earth is precious and I need to live it to the fullest. That's what I am learning for myself after years of being brainwashed and I hope to instill similar beliefs in my kids.

All this does is replace this seeming paradox with the exact same paradox.  Ok now you have a God.  Remember when you had such a problem with everything needing a start and nothing is eternal?

Now that, that is where the pain comes from. It's a selfish mental pain, but one of the most fundamental because it is derived from it's equal and opposite - love. Can you transcend it. I'm sure from time to time. Never truly can you forget the memories. A bittersweet duality of existence.

I think, we are stuck in an infinite loop of existing and not existing.
Because death always finds a way and so does life.
For example, after I die, I will become what I was before I was born and it will be that way until my ""new"" parents have sex again or the right environment is created for me to be born again. Like how every plant/animal etc needs a certain condition to thrive.

Now to drift of to a completely different topic, the realisation of ""your existence"" is what makes you, you. 
Now let's say, that a building that you are in, is on fire and you end up losing your life. That realisation of  ""you existing/your existence"" is now gone, until you are born again and can relate to the feeling as ""you again"", does that mean you are born again but obviously without knowing your past.

I recently realized that our choices are merely an illusion, it is our brain patterns that decide what we enact, we can only be conscious about it, but even the choice of being conscious and detached is predetermined. This has given me a ton of anxiety and suicidal depression. People that 'awaken' or lead a peaceful life are lucky that the universe of cause and effect has given them that experience. But what about all the people that suffer or commit suicide? I am afraid of leading a life of suffering and never being able to let go, simply because it's not in my power and is 'decided' by the universe. Since I've realized this I've not been able to detach from my mind chatter anymore, because everytime I do I am reminded that I didn't have the choice to do so, and maybe I'm fated to end up killing myself. 
To make matters worse, I don't even see that as an escape because 'I' will just experience another life, which can be a good one but also another filled with suffering, and so on. This seems like a never ending nightmare.

1694931733.0,"The older I get, the more I realize that life is not worth living","As I grow older, I increasingly realize that life may not be what we were promised when we were children. It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

&#x200B;

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

&#x200B;

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

&#x200B;

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

I (30F) have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for almost three years now.

I've made life-changing decisions hoping my inner experience would rearrange and stabilise in a healthy state and yet here I am, still struggling.

I've experienced a lot of loss in these last three years, in addition to a Dark Night of the Soul in my own search for meaning.

In my mind, things are very simple. This loss is part of life and some things must die within us so that others can be born. Sometimes self-realization implies leaving worthy things behind. Sometimes the lack of shadow work culminates in that loss. All is part of life and one more step in our own learning process.

I've reached a point where I see my thoughts are changing and if one wants a life of meaning it's just a matter of leading a life of service. You want a meaningful life? Well, there is plenty of people who needs help out there, a lot of activism needed, a lot of entrepreneurs, and so on. As Viktor Frankl put it, it's not only about what we want and expect from life but what it expects and requires us to do.

Yet this intellectual realisation is not changing my emotional state. Sometimes I do feel better but then there is a restrain - like my current job and contractual restrictions or the fact that I need to make money to survive - that only makes things harder and, at some point, even not worth it. I search to connect with someone outside of Reddit and I can't, so I feel lonely. I remember the times where I was mostly alone and felt great, and now that solitude sometimes kills me. 

I'm working on the things that depend on me but, like any living organism, I depend on that environment and others for survival and fulfilment.

My dad who is a very intellectual guy, believes I'm just weak and should work on my discipline. Do I miss my ex check her Insta and become depressed? Well, have the discipline to not check her Instagram. Do I get sad because I cannot do x or y? Well do z. He also doesn't care about relationships even though he relies on wealthy women for his survival. He pays so little attention to things that matter and affect me that naturally life is easier for him. And I wonder if this is just me being 'a woman', overcomplicating things.

In other words, maybe I'm just a weak coward who doesn't want to put in the work to live a life worth living.

I genuinely don't believe I'm fit for life, I'm not interested in putting in the work to stand a chance, I genuinely would like to die.

I came here hoping someone will share an insight or life experience that may help me want to live.

have pretty bad OCD, and the past few years existence has been my main obsession, but before spring this year, I could at least still go outside and enjoy myself somewhat, but since then I am absolutely 100% crippled and disabled with sheer panic and terror every single day, basically glued to bed unable to even eat or shower most days.

It just seems so much more than just OCD tho, it truly feels like I really have realised too much about my own existence and consciousness and it's absolutely destroying my mind, I feel so fucking bizarre now I've legit wondered if I have a brain tumor or some shit

As for the realisation/knowledge, it's basically just the realisation that solipsism is literally extremely true, and this unbearable hyperawareness that I will never ever be able to ever escape my own consciousness or my body, I feel legit physically claustrophobic inside my own consciousness and im constantly fucking tortured with the absolute EXCRUTIATING overawareness of just how ridiculously fucking bizarre and absurd consciousness and existence really is, and the fact I can literally never escape it ever, even after I die I'll probably be trapped in some kind of existence somewhere, it's like being trapped inside existence literally never ever ever fucking stops, and neither does my constant panic at this realisation, it gives me the weirdest most bizarre thoughts, it's fucking ruined my life, and im only 24

I can't stress enough the level of terror that these thoughts and realisations cause me, it literally makes me audibly gasp sometimes whilst I'm shaking in bed with my eyes closed grasping at my headboard desperately trying to forget what I know, doesn't work tho, all I do is just lay there in constant constant unending fucking panic and terror, it's turning me into a genuine alcoholic too so that's an added bonus

Seriously is there any way past this? Am I basically just perma-fucked now? Can I ever revert back to a state where in not constantly losing my mind in fear?

1694794275.0,"Life was supposed to be meaningless, But...","&#x200B;

But If life was supposed to be meaningless, we all would have never given Consciousness by evolution and we all would be dead brain, just existing and doing our work till we die like all of animal kingdom (Tho most humans also work that way), you see animals don't need a meaning to their life cuz they are born with it. This post applies perfectly to all the animals in the world, except humans. Cuz humans have consciousness. 

In this way evolution cursed us to find our own meaning of life, right?

But still, evolution gave us consciousness, why? Think about it. 

Well, the literally answer here is to choose our own jobs, you see in our hunter gatherer world the jobs were going increasingly complex. Someone was a fighter, someone was a food gatherer. Someone was explorer. Someone was the cook and someone had to manage it all. 

So evolution thought of giving humans consciousness, so you know we can choose our own speciality and master in it, thus increasing efficiency. And this actually worked out for us. 

Now if you replace jobs with the meaning of life. Then you'll understand pretty quick that evolution gave us consciousness to decide our meaning of life. It's like existentialist philosophers said, Life is meaningless until we add our own meaning to it.

Or even simpler terms, Life got no objective meaning, just Subjective ones.",1

1694725856.0,"People here seem to not quite understand existentialism, given the number of edgy posts that resemble teenage monologues.","This post was spurred by the following comment:

""That's why philosophical pessimism is superior to the nonsense that we can just create meaning out of thin air.

Not wanting to be exploited for mere survival is not being lazy. The contrary is what's delusional.""

It might not precisely seem like it means much of anything broadly, but I think it's representative of a common mistake made by those who are either new to existentialism and philosophy in general, or those who aren't in the best place mentally; seeking to remediate these feelings of dread, sadness, or loneliness by expressing them via an existentialist *font* so-to-speak.

The ""mistake"" in question is the fallacious assumption that you have ""got it"" and you have the ""right"" answers after breaking out of the ""ignorance"" that many people live their life within. I think it's also reasonable to portray a fair portion of this subreddit under those that make this mistake, take a moment to scroll through and you'll see what I mean. Flurries of posts essentially boiling down to ""I'm terrified what the fuck is happening?"" or (Read this with a gloomy tone) ""Everyone around me... just lambs to the slaughter... But I... I know what is beyond..."". The first one is a less intense expression of the ""mistake"" I'm pointing out, while the other is certainly a bit of a hyperbole, but nonetheless encapsulates the spirit of many posts that come through this space.

To begin understanding why I call this a ""mistake"" we should probably understand what Existentialism (The very subreddit these posts pop up on) even means. To put almost inappropriately simply:  Existentialism is a philosophical movement that focuses on individual  freedom, choice, and subjective experience. It asserts that people are free agents who must create their own essence and meaning in an otherwise indifferent or even absurd universe.

But notice how that definition *never* serves the prescription of what that meaning is or how it should manifest, only that we cannot say that we have ""The answer"" to existence.  Yet, A recurring pattern in this subreddit, perhaps even emblematic of a wider cultural phenomenon within philosophy, is the tendency to see existentialism as an endpoint rather than a process. To be clear, breaking free from conventional modes of thinking or societal impositions is not the culmination of existentialism—the terror, confusion, depression, or ego trip borne of existential dread is not the culmination of existentialism—it's merely the beginning.

To hopefully demonstrate in a neat package, as to why coming to this conclusion is parsimonious:

Existentialism is not a monolith but a living, breathing entity that beckons continuous engagement. It's a journey that begins, for many, with often misguided realization of life's potential  meaninglessness, or the shattering of preconceived societal constructs. Yet, it is only the first step on a path. It promises no ""escapes from the matrix"" that validates your depression, it does not promise clarity, but instead, it's a PERFECT tool to a deeper, more intimate dance with ambiguity.

Considering the comment that triggered this reflection, it underscores a classic predicament. The presumption that a stooped philosophical  pessimism holds a higher ground compared to other existential viewpoints appears to be a retreat into another form of certainty. And many who engage with notions of absurdity, or flirt with nihilistic tendencies, prescribe it solely as a philosophy of despair, misinterpreting the entirety of their depth and range. Like digging from one jail cell with a spoon into another.

The surge of posts that oscillate between desolation and an almost messianic sense of enlightenment signal an engagement with existentialism that's still in its infancy. I'm almost sympathetic though, as these are usually reflective of genuine turmoil or revelation, yet they miss the point that its a step up to expansion, and unfortunately go back to the same epistemic traps they so boldly claimed to escape. While it begins with questioning the established norms and confronting the void, it doesn't end there. Existentialism is not about wallowing in the abyss or  standing on a pedestal of newfound knowledge, looking down upon the uninformed masses. It's about navigating the space in between, continuously questioning, re-evaluating, and embracing the fluidity of existence.

This is not a doctrine of truth, or answers. I hope you can realize the shallow nature of mistaking the doomerpill fed to you by your depression, or existential angst, is a trap of its own.

1694722054.0,What do you think happens after death?,"I've no clue, and no concept. I've read stories of people being ""clinically dead"" and all reporting a warm embrace, letting go of all emotion, complete calm and contentment. That's all well and good, but that to me doesn't constitute DEATH, idk it still seems like you're technically alive, just in a very low powered state, kinda like putting your computer to sleep. The closest thing I've ever experienced to death is a dream I had. Long story short, I got shot in the dream, and I remember just seeing the world fade, I blacked out, last thing I see is the perp looking at me with a scowl, and then I woke back up in the same location, but it was all white. All the people in the room with me who were going to be killed popped up too. We all just kinda felt relief, and I started thinking of the how sad the previous world was. Then I woke up. What do you guys think? Consciousness is so fascinating, it's just atoms working together to formulate whatever we are experiencing, and yet we have NO concept of what makes it all work. We have good ideas and theories, but really nothing that can be nailed down. It's up there with God imo. We fight back and fourth about whether God is real, and even the religious don't ""know"", hence faith. The people who have been clinically dead, say they no longer fear it, and I guess that's good for that initial fear of the process of death, but to me what comes after is truly the scariest and worst part. What is NOTHING? People say it's like before you were born, what does that mean? They are making it sound like you experienced nothing before you experienced life. No, you experienced life, you just were alive one day. So to say what comes after is like something you never experienced just makes no sense. I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.",1

1694651697.0,Extreme Anxiety,"I'm basically just posting this to get my thoughts out of my head and (hopefully) for someone to see them and maybe relate to thisor offer some advice. It started when i was around 15, I'm 19 now. I started worrying about religion and afterlife and hell and the endless possibilities it could bring. I moved on from it until around a month ago, I took some weed which has sent me in to panic like this almost every time, so i had stopped. But I made the stupid decison that night to take some. When i did, everything i touched began to feel strange,like it was morphing onto my skin almost, then i began to think that for one reality, i had chosen what heaven and hell was, and went to my own 'personal hell' and had found my place in the universe as a strange cube like shape with strange feelings. Looking back, I believe that the strange feeling when touching things were some sort of sensory issue and that my personal hell was my anxiety mixed with how my room looked (the cube being my walls and the strange shape being my bed). 

After this night i decided to not take it again and still havent and dont believe i ever will, but it has left me with this anxiety. I have been diagnosed with anxiety by a medical professional so as is expected, this has sent me into a spiral of the meaning of life and death, the possibility of an afterlife and hell and the possibility of reincarnation.

I think my biggest worry is the fear of the unknown, as i expect is usually the common fear among everyone. I have began to understand that the present moment is all that we know we have and that the best way to go through life is to experience everything you can, learn from your mistakes and be the best person you can possibly be. 

The possibility of the afterlife is a comforting one to say the least, but not guaranteed. I believe that if there is a higher power, or a purpose to this life then a hell would be irrational and serve no purpose, especially not an eternal one. If we are put here for a reason i believe that reason is to learn and experience life, what comes after this we dont know which is all we know.

Although I have accepted that this is the best way to live life and that I need to embrace the unknown, I'm still struggling with the anxiety of what if im doing the wrong thing? What if I need to put God first if there is one? What if that deal i tried to make with the devil when i was drunk and 15 has condemned me? What if there is nothing at all?  

I would love to take comfort in a religion or belief but I want to accept that things will be how they are supposed to be, regardless of religion or belief. I hope that if there is a God/higher power, that he would not judge people solely on their belief in him, or reward and punish people based on the life they have lived because every person has different circumstances and the best way forward is to learn from mistakes, whether right here right now, or in the afterlife if there is one.

Sorry for making such a long post but if you have read this i really appreciate it. And if anyone could offer any advice on overcoming this constant fear i would greatly appreciate it as i feel that i am all alone in these thoughts and experiences. 

Edit: Thank you so much for all of your responses guys, they’ve really helped me with working through this stuff in my mind and i appreciate you all taking the time to read this and to offer your thoughts and advice. <3",1

1694576611.0,No fucking chance would infinite monkeys with infinite time and typewriters eventually type Shakespeare.,"They're never going to accidentally hallucinate 1600s English language and grammar and turns of phrase, as well as the associated socio-political milieu required to produce that language AND then randomly maintain Shakespeare's personal writing style for numerous acts and plays, all in a row? Without knowing what any of it meant because they're just mashing at the keyboards?

The only monkey ever who could come close was Shakespeare himself. So no monkeys in infinity ever, just one very advanced monkey outlier you can almost not call a monkey.

So ok ONE monkey stumbled on writing Shakespeare after millennia, when all typewriter monkeys collectively evolved into humans who abandoned the gift of infinite typewriters and chose instead to write with a fucking quill by hand the thing that supposedly, a monkey on a literal typewriter could literally randomly do according to the Monkey Theorem.

So not totally zero. One weirdo outlier in a universe of normals. So long as we we agree that “infinity monkeys” also means “whatever weird creatures monkeys develop into.” 

This hypothetical typewriter monkey without a typewriter outlier is so special, it should not be reduced to what monkeys can do. Shakespeare was unique and rare and odd and smart and sexy and fun and inappropriate. Flaunting the rules of society because he knew that they were only there to disguise the typical truth. Saying whatever he fucking wanted and fucking whoever he wanted because he was so much more than even infinite monkeys could smash out after being chained to a typewriter for the full infinity years. Even then, they wouldn't come up with what a human decided to change and do.

So. Now that we are unburdened by the conviction that we are unspecial monkeys (we are actually special monkeys and the typewriters are the psychological burden of of comparing ourselves to monkeys), what all do we want to do better and different and more enjoyably and inappropriately than everybody else? 

&#x200B;

We are only free as individuals if we maximize our unique human capacity to self-upgrade our monkey programming. Social, psychological, biological. We can decide to make Humans different. We are most human, least like monkeys, if we try a new weird thing that our instincts drive us to and/or based on our weird and unique brains, and modify our environments and genetics in less than one lifetime, and then tell people about it. 

The meanings of life are to Evolve and Protect the Hive. To step away from the typewriter and say FUCK THIS and go create a trajectory for yourself and your neighbors that improves on the pre-evolved way of doing things. Humans are programmed to do this, some more than others. Only when monetized is our creativity bad for our neighbors. We deserve to own our evolutions! We should not let companies pay us to create new and better versions of the world so they can sell it for too much.

We can hyperevolve as individuals and efficiently communicate with our neighbors about an option for them to improve their survival and the survival of their neighbors. 

We can all just go out, be whatever is right for us, learn about it and change it and test it out for survival, and get right back to you on if it improves our lives.  Other animals are to dumb to do this. Except maybe ants.

We're not a monkey hallucination. We're more like demigods who are only held back by our lack of ant-like community support.

I have the semi unique experience(s) too of having a couple near death experiences, one were I fully went ""into the black"" and believe I was dead and one where I  was pulled into the ocean by a current that I couldn't see and nearly drowned but made it back to shore. The first experience has kinda outright left me with no fear of death because it appears to me that it's just like shutting off a light switch and nothing matters, it's kinda made me into a thrill seeker to be honest.

Anyway to get to the point of the title, I think it is selfish when someone's only response to suicidal thoughts is that they would miss you, I understand we're they're coming from and why they say it, but if a person is genuinely unhappy with their existence and the only thing that is offered for advice is that ""it can change"" or ""you can change it"" when all you've been doing is trying to change it and try different experiences with no fleeting success and only temporary relief at best, I honestly believe assisted suicide should be offered to everyone above 18 who wants it not just people who need it medically.

I don't believe meds are a do all-end all either I have nothing against people that use them and I have tried them myself but sometimes I think people just realize the bullshit of life and that's why they get so down, I'm not ignorant to the fact that many people in developing countries have it very bad, I've seen it in person too, but that doesn't invalidate ones own feelings.

Honestly I wouldn't even call myself suicidal, I just don't care anymore if I did die and have completely mentally checked out at this point, I'm sick of trying, the dream goal would of been a nomadic existence in a van or an RV with a small hobby farm and even the rich have ruined this for the average person, what a joke.",1
1694343185.0,hell lol,okay new to reddit & looking for answers lol. lately i’ve been stuck in these loops of thinking about things from a crazy perspective i never have before. it scares me. actually about a minute into thinking about how or why i’m here (or even a person??) i start having a panic attack. i have thoughts that i can’t even describe to anyone else! the best way for me to describe would be my thinking process. first it starts off with “how can i see through my eyes right now?” or something to that extent. then it goes onto how am i here. it does feel like im in a simulation and have no purpose for being here. i don’t understand this feeling and it is so new to me i don’t know what to do about it!,1

1694258132.0,We are pudding,"( Assisted By chat GPT, Grammar adjusted as well as vocabulary, if you want to view the video, its in the end)  
Have you ever taken a moment to wonder if there might be more to humans than meets the eye? It's a bit peculiar, but let's embark on an enjoyable journey to explore this notion further.  
Consider pudding for a moment. It's soft, sweet, and offers an array of flavors. In a similar fashion, humans come in all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds. Our diverse experiences and the choices we make in life create a unique tapestry, much like the various flavors of pudding.  
But there's an interesting parallel here. Just as pudding has layers, so do our minds. Within us, there are different layers of thoughts and feelings. Some are readily apparent, like the creamy top layer of pudding, while others lie deeper, concealed from plain view. Similar to the way we scoop through pudding to discover its hidden layers, we can peel back the layers of our thoughts and emotions.  
Now, you might be wondering why we're drawing this comparison between humans and pudding. It's not merely for the sake of amusement. Instead, it's a way to illustrate that, like pudding, we humans possess both fragility and resilience. Life can be a bit like a spoon cutting through pudding — it can be tough at times. But just as pudding doesn't lose its sweetness when stirred or served, we humans have a remarkable ability to bounce back and adapt, even when faced with adversity.  
As we delve deeper into this idea, we'll explore the intricacies of human thought, the rich tapestry of emotions we experience, and the underlying connections that bind us together as a species. This journey promises to challenge your perspective on what it means to be human.  
So, let's maintain the simplicity and sweetness of this analogy as we continue to explore the playful comparison between humans and pudding. Get ready for an engaging and enlightening adventure into the heart of what defines us as individuals and as a species!

1694197450.0,What did you study? What do you work as? What do you do?,"I'm really curious as to what everyone is doing in their life here, are you studying something? Working? What do you do? 

I'm a first year philosophy student in my last semester and I've realized at this point that one of the only things that bring me pleasure in life is to sit in a philosophy class and listen to my professor talk, write my assignments and do my projects, of course I understand that might change in the future.

I'm taking three philosophy classes right now, the other two are psychology and an english course. I feel so complete, happy and fulfilled when I attend a philosophy class that I can't think of anything else I'd like to do with my life. 

But I really wonder, does anyone here study philosophy as a major? What's it like, to be an existentialist and study philosophy in post secondary? Or what do you work as?

And how exactly do you feel about it, how does it effect your work or school life?

Edit; sorry if someone's already asked something like this before. I question what I study at times but I get reminded of how great it feels to sit in class and listen and write so I really wanted to know if anyone else here feels the same way.",1

So what do we do? As humans we take decisions. These decisions are based on what we think is right. But why? Why should we take decisions based on our own opinion? What if it's wrong to everyone else? Isn't it better to just follow somebody else as it's guaranteeed that at least one person will have that opinion? Why trust ourselves?",1
1694176233.0,Does immortality make anyone else uncomfortable?,"So for 3.8 billion years there was life which was always followed by death, always. It's just a 'natural' part of life and death is central and such a core part of our lives and the lives of every living thing on earth. But it makes me feel eerie and weird knowing that one day in the future there will certainly be a time where we achieve either immortality or be able to live for thousands of years. Especially as our technological advancements are increasing at an absurd exponential rate. We have barely scratched the surface and not even had our current technology for a couple of hundred years, look at how far we've come as a species, from cave dwellers and not having language to the modern man. From wooden boats and horses to F-22 raptors and Stealth bombers and helicopters. From apes that couldn't even talk to the James webb telescope, language, art, the ISS, quantum computing, rockets, genetic engineering, AI, Nukes, the internet, virtual reality, nanotechnology, coding, particle accelerators, tiny devices in our pocket that holds all known information in the universe; the list is endless.

Many scientists and futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, believe that in the next couple of hundred years we will reach some sort of immortality, whether it's digital immortality by scanning your brain and uploading your consciousness or biological immortality by being able to stop and reverse aging. There are hundreds of breakthroughs every year and billions of dollars going into these areas of research and every single day we're getting closer to achieving it. I 100% believe at some point in the future we will achieve immortality, if not, then will at the least extend human lifespan to be able to live for thousands of years.

It's easy to take the limits of our own vision for the limits of the world, as 1000 years ago if you predicted we'd have magic instant communication devices in our pocket and metal boxes that would take you to the moon you'd be executed for heresy or laughed at for being insane. But in reality it's easy to imagine that all humanity has ever achieved thus far, is but the dream before the true awakening.

It makes me feel uneasy knowing that death is something that faces everyone I know on earth right now, all my friends and family, death is something inevitable and looms over every one of our lives. But one day in the future death could just be a choice. It kinda makes me sad knowing that this colossal problem we all currently face and centre our lives around, will be laughed at in the future, they'll be in shock that humans only used to live around 80 years. It makes me feel small and question the fundamental questions of what is life, and what is death.",1
1694143327.0,Why?,"I wrote this about a month ago. Sitting calmly just thinking for about 40 minutes. This is unrefined and me just getting my thoughts written down in my notes to clear my head, never intended to share, so it may not flow or come across exactly as I was thinking in the moment but I think you’ll get the gist. 

- I never tried to actually put this into words, 
The rock I threw rolls interacting with the forest floor, you can feel it vibrate along as it rolls, you can see what pine needles it brushes up maybe kicks up some dirt. It stops 
The forest floor surrounding me is covered in pine needles and some twigs and leaves and pine cones. And rocks everywhere strewn about but more likely than not they weren’t placed but happened upon this place naturally 

This is such a weird world we live in. It’s all taken for granted except for the parts unfamiliar to us like how many aspects of space baffle those uninitiated. As we’re all familiar with the earth and forests etc I feel it is all taken for granted

Let’s slow down. Remove humanity. The sun circles every day. Growing plants, providing warmth. Fast forward the sun watch it over weeks, months, years, spins really fast and plants grow alongside. But on a geological timescale still not much has happened. Eventually a volcano may erupt a tsunami may crash into shores whatever. The sun keeps moving the earth keeps spinning. It’s all on a completely different time scale than what we live on. I’m sitting here in this forest but 10,000 years ago and 10,000 from now this place will be absolutely certainly different but similar and the whole world will change but again in similar ways

What are these laws that govern how things change? The pace and all
Now it’s easy to trace spin back from star formation to planet formation and see what will and what has formed. Whatever. All that shows is the laws we have already defined and understand. I’m looking for deeper not just understanding that time flows forward and things change at different rates. I’m asking why

We know some fundamental things about how this universe works. Discs, spheres held together by forces like gravity. Understand forces like electromagnetism centripetal force, but why for any of it? We understand how all these forces work but why are they seperated?

Why does the rock actually hold itself together I understand the atoms are structured as so in a crystalline and I understand we can trace it back to it’s creation but why? I think I have to trace back from the rock to it’s planets formation to it’s stars formation. I want to see where the line ends. 

Why are these forces and laws in place governing everything? How different could everything be with any kind of alteration? Our entire understanding is a minuscule point of a vast sea of options. Our entire universe is a study one of one. We somewhat understand some things about our own but can we truly understand what’s going on without comparison or any context whatsoever 

Now diving back into it being weird, why do things form into spheres? Gravity? Why have we accepted this as understandable and normal? Of course a sphere would be perfect governed by these laws but why are these laws like that. Why is there order? Why do droplets if water form into a sphere? Why does any of it happen? Why are there atoms? Why do they attract eachother? Why do these forces exist? Why is it all happening?

I subscribe to the Big Bang or a variation possibly the multiverse too. But do they all have atoms? Or antimatter? Are they all the same basic building blocks? Where did those blocks come from? Why do we accept this as normal why is this normal? Trees are weird plants are weird but much much more weird is the whole thing working together. The universe from the stars to the dirt underneath my feet. Why is there anything at all? Shouldn’t the universe be a blank white space? Why is there dirt?
 Consciousness is extremely baffling and may actually be the answer to all my questions 

Who knows if we’re seeing anything as it really is? On the EM spectrum I know we aren’t but what else what hidden are we missing? Neutrinos sure. What if there are other forces acting on things completely undetected or undetectable. What if our detection all of our data is fake or skewed in some way?

Hard to work your way out when you don’t know what you’re in
Hard to find out from inside

Everything normal is taken for granted when in reality every single thing in this universe is profound

We distracted ourselves with society and it’s gone on long enough now that most have forgotten where they’ve come from unless they’ve rediscovered the true world doing what it does without our day to day lives interfering. 

Our day to day makes up what we are but it also locks us into a system just meant to keep pushing humanity forward to greater discovery and wealth for all

The little kids grow up just a bit and start families of their own, still kids at heart well into late age sometimes. Everyone has lived their own life  and is their own center. Watching from afar brings perspective into your own life

We drive around in automobiles most people not knowing a thing about them. We take our life our achievements and everything for granted and I think that’s how we push forward.

The most important questions to take away, questions I’d like answered
Why is there anything at all? Shouldn’t the universe be a blank white space? Why is there dirt?
Consciousness is extremely baffling and may actually be the answer to all my questions.
Everything normal is taken for granted when in reality every single thing in this universe is profound

Specifically the laws we’ve tried and tested and know to be true, why does the universe follow the pattern it does

Could it be part of the Big Bang? An explosion over time and we’re experiencing part of a minuscule pattern that emerges, like a few bubbles in a row or a lightning zig zag, I guess I’m asking why those things happen in the first place once again though. I’m not sure we can answer these questions",1
1694143305.0,Is this just me?,"Alright. Just to make this short, I've been dealing with existential issues since I was about 6. However, there was multiple occurrences which I would mention if you asked me what type of issues I'm talking about. I don't know the name of this or if it's just me, but this is how I would describe it.

I'm at a market with my family. I'm having a good time until a FLASH of thoughts like ""what happens after death,"" ""what's the point of life,"" and ""you're gonna die one day"" all comes into my head at once. My heart feels like it drops for a second and now beats faster. I have this emotion that immediately takes over me, but the closest word I can get to describe it is fear. I feel like I'm having a mini existential panic attack, but im not sure a panic attack would feel like this.

However, this all happens in just a few seconds, or even a minute or 2. This occurs multiple days. Sometimes it goes away and doesn't come back for a good amount of months, but I can never tell when it's going away or coming. Is anyone else familiar with anything like this?

1694124276.0,The experience is what matters,"In the last months, I've been getting better from an anxiety-depression disorder and part of trying to get better mental health, I am trying to get a better framework for what is deal about our existence. I've been likeing and taking inspiration the idea of absurdism by Albert Camus (or at least why I understand about it).

So right now, I see the existence  intrinsically meaningless, but you can have a meaning born from your personal experiences, whatever they are good, neutral, or bad. The moments themselves have their real meaning, at least to yourself and to other people you share them with. Maybe this is a stretch, but also in the great picture those moments happened in an specific space and time and no matter how small they are, there is nothing in the universe that can change that (or at least for what we know). 

So, in some way, we create meaning in this meaningless universe by creating moments, following ambitions or ideas, communities, hobbies, art, and stories. Try to improve ourselves and our environment to the best of our abilities (with out punishing urselves) to discover new stuff and create new experiences and meanings that we couldn't experience before. And even if possible help to other people to have their meaning become a reality, and we should avoid to do ""bad"" stuff because it would mean to deprive other people from creating their own meaning in this universe.

However I think a mistake was made. Thinking that it was a probability based question. Meaning there was a probability that something existed and there was another probability that nothing existed. And we just happened to get lucky.

However the question seems a lot deeper than that. It deals with the most fundamental aspect of reality which created the universe, laws, consciousness and mechanism which allows us to be observers in this complex system.

The most fundamental aspect of reality in which everything is built from should answer the question. However it should also show why there was no other option. Reality was always going to be that way.

And just trying to grasp what that fundamental aspect of reality is seems infinitely out of reach. However the fact that we are here and everything turned out the way it is. Tells us that we were always going to exist and there was no way in which nothing at all would have existed.",1

1694028497.0,This is probably my final writing before I start looking for a psychologist.,"it seems that I could no longer contain this within me, this will be one large rant and probably my last one. An essay I guess is probably a word more appropriate to describe what you're about to read.

I must warn you in advance that what you're about to read is something that has been driving me to the edge for a long time, I hope it doesn't do the same to you.

But I digress. The topic, of this essay, is the complexity and cruel irony of life. 

We all search for meaning. Something to make us feel like we're worthwhile, like this life is worthwhile. Some of us find something that is enough to avert our eyes from the crippling thoughts of meaning and meaninglessness. Because meaning is subjective. There is no absolute law of meaning or purpose or reason for being.

Reality only exists in our heads. Did you know that you can't even perceive the colors you're looking at right now? We as humans cannot comprehend, with our eyes nor our brains, combinations of colors of more than 2. You think me a liar, go get 3 different markers. If you get anything, but brown. You're a 0.000000000001%. If you mix the core 3 colors - Red, Green and Blue - you get brown. Now I'm not saying to mix yellow, orange and some offwhite to get a lighter tone - therefore 3 colors I proved u wrong dumbass - No. Mix 3 core colors. So we cannot even perceive the world around us as it truly is. An insect is capable of observing 100m+ colors. Can you believe that? The beauty that we're incapable of comprehending... Such a waste... Anyway. 

The fact that reality is subjective and only exists in our heads is both something to be celebrated and lameneted. Simultaneuosly. Why? Because you can make your life anything you want. You can bend reality to be whatever you want it to be, all it takes is perceverance and mental capacity. You can build the reality you want to be in, you've all the tools. You want to be rich, in good shape and energetic all the time?The asnwer is quite simple, it hides in your head. In your subconscious mind, in your imagination. For example a way to get energy if you're feeling down. Imagine a moment where you were full of energy. Imagine it so vividly as if you're back. You'll get the energy from back then. You don't have such a moment? Neither do I. I make ones. Thru imagination. You bend reality. You get the energy you think you desire.

&#x200B;

**Desire**. Funny thing to think about. I read this comic - Sweet Home - a manhwa where parasites, that *\*SPOILER\** turn out to be our souls, trap us in our minds and give us all that we might desire. Every dream,  every goal, every ambition, every moment spent with a loved one, everything. And do you know what is at the end of desire? What happens when you achieve what you've set out to achieve? Futility. Futility is what  awaits us all. Hence the saying **Ralph Waldo Emerson “It's the not the Destination, It's the journey.”** it's climbing the mountain, not being at the top. There is nothing to do at the top. At the top is lonely. boring and cold. On the way up there's friends, there's camps, there's celebration for fails, for wins, theres fun. On the journey there's life. On the destination there's futility. How does one cope with it?

One finds another mountain to climb. Or suicide. No way around futility. 

But aren't our lifes futile either way? How you live? How you die? What meaning does it bear, to what end do we struggle and strive and be in pain for so long? Everything we create will rot and decay, everything we make will disappear and be forgotten. Our kids will wither and die, we will wither and die. The best of us will have their names echoe for centuries, but they will too be eventually forgotten. For example take the ancient civilizationsm. We all know they existed, but there's no real record of what they were or where they were. Just that they might have been at one point in time. No one remembers all those countless years of evolution spent building something.

At the core we're still animals all we want to do is find food, shelter and reproduce. Our hunting has just evolved, so that our senses become more dull and are more susceptible to mass manipulation. Because my friend believe me if 1 000 000 people simultaneously said ""My life is not worth 3k a month to barely scrape to pay rent and bills and await the next paycheck in anxiety of something breaking down."" If, just if - hypothetically - that amount of people woke up and decided ""No, this is enough."" it will be a disaster on a national scale. The sheep are guided by fear. Imagine 1 000 000 people  who have nothing to lose. Who have said 'What you have given me to think I might lose is nothing that I desire any longer, I want that which you're withholding from me. MY TRUE FREEDOM. AND I WILL GET IT ON MY OWN NOW!' That's what our governments truly fear. A mass of people capable of critical thinking with nothing to lose.

*"" You cannot strike fear into a man who has no one he loves*

&#x200B;

*You cannot persuade a man who wants nothing*

&#x200B;

*You cannot give hope to a man who has already given up*

&#x200B;

*You cannot argue with a man who does not care*

&#x200B;

*You cannot defeat a man who has nothing to lose*

&#x200B;

*So be wary of the man who is empty and alone*

&#x200B;

*For he has nothing to lose but everything to gain ""*

&#x200B;

We're drawing near to that end. As more and more of us end up alone and in the loneliness there is a piece of forbidden knowledge, accessible only to those who can survive in extreme solitary. That is above all the main objective of all the internet drama, news, every media... Diversion and propaganda, to silence the voice in our heads, to be used as jammers in the lonely nights. So the knowledge does not enter your head, but if you listen closely and ache in it you will get insight into so much that you've previously not even thought of. 

**The things you own, end up owning you. You need to let go, you're more than the sum of your urges.** At the end of the day who are you? You? Are you a sack of bone, muscle, fat and viscera? Or are you the individual experience compiled from everything you have been thru? What and who are you? Because you're neither your body nor your mind nor are you the combination of experiences that you have been forcefully thrust into. Then where does that leave us? Dangling over an edge on a bridge, called 'sanity' gazing into the raging waters beneath us 'madness', thinking ""Who am I?"" That answer I do not have. As I am sure most of us have experienced a moment in our life where we have had knowledge, previously never heard or learned anywhere, be accessible to us. In other words connecting with a greater source of knowledge. The majority of people have had at least one such moment. Where you've innately known something that you just couldn't have known, you didnt read, hear or see it anywhere. But you knew it. You connected with that source, even for just a limited amount of time, but you did outreach to something greater than you. Does that mean that we're not individuals, but parts of something. Cogs in a machine created by an incomphrehensible force? The force being god, whatever it is you believe in. I belive in chaotic ironic balance. Does that bring you solace?  To me it brings me distress. Knowing that I am created for no real reason to be a part of something I will never conciously grasp and be forced to play pretend in a theater that bears the name - society. 

Being a cog in a machine is for some people the dream. Some people like to be part of something else. To believe that they're part of something greater than themselves. Conciousness... That's the bane of it all. The sickening sense that you exist. We as people we don't really want to be beings, we just simply wanna be, but we cannot really be, because we strive constantly to disintegrate. Our self, tries constantly to disappear. Look beyond the veil of the most enjoyable activities in this life and realise they are the process of becoming unself. Sex, love, substances, alcohol... Even fun itself. Happiness is the process of killing self awareness... 

There's also the foolish belief that there's some combination of choices out there that will save you from who you are. That tomorrow you might wake up decide that you'll travel go to Parish, Prague etc.. That the new car will complete us, that a certain amount of cash will solve all our issues... It doesn't matter how satisfied your material urges are if you soul is diseased... With most of us our loneliness outweights our love with the gravity of a world.. We have more pains than comfortable moments, more regret than pride... How does the bad compare to the good in our life? The negatives are overwhelming. 

There's another sad aspect to this. You, the reader. There's a chance that you who is reading this have lived a life more comfortable than the vast majority of humans that have ever lived, yet you're here reading this.  And you're still unhappy. **What does that tell you about life?** 

How is this negative experience justified and worth it? A wanderer condemned to search for something he can never find... I have quite a bit more in me, but I will end it here. As I doubt anyone would bother reading further. If I went on I'd be writing a manuscript...

So it is sort of you're the most important person right now, the one that would leave me devastated if something bad happened to them, but I know a few weeks (months or years for some) after breaking up, I won't give a shit about you, and my friends being till the end is totally feasible, but even though I prioritize my current SO. This makes things pretty complicated, as I tend to overlay certain thoughts over my feelings. Thoughts like everything I feel is ""artificial"" or empty and meaningless, and I should never pass up any chance of something because I could break up with this person anytime soon and I'd be fine anyway.  One more thing that I can't articulate clearly, I would get over losing that person while being together, and this is the biggest cognitive dissonance ever, because how is there room in my mind for being so aware of the fact that the relationship is worthless in the long-term and at the same time I couldn't help but see that person as my only loved one forever if the ending of the relationship were other than our call?

I know I elaborated in a very weird manner, but the topic's there for anyone to comment.

The teacher was fantastic and I was enraptured by all the readings, but that's not really the point.  


I remember my teacher giving us this quote that really stuck with me, but I can't manage to find it. It went something along the lines of: ""If there are saints, they wouldn't be in heaven. They'd all be in hell."" something something because a true saint would be where there's work to be done. Does this ring a bell to anyone? I'd really appreciate the help.

1693918135.0,How Does Anyone Cope With This?,"I've fallen into an existential depression. Whenever I think about the ""why"" of existence, I think about the very real possibility that there is no ""why."" If I try to turn to a higher power, I think about how if we're able to communicate with one, then that must mean it's on some sort of similar wavelength with us, therefore, that must mean that it also just comes up with its own meaning to its existence. Hope that makes sense.

Evolution suggests that all we do is survive to reproduce, propagating our genes for some unspecified reason. Religion tells us that we exist to serve some higher purpose that was arbitrarily decided by a god, and even then, does the god know why they exist? Would any answer that can be articulated through human speech ever be sufficient? 

I suppose that it's almost comforting to think that maybe existence in general is all meaningless, so anything that exists can create its own meaning, but for some reason, that just isn't good enough. It's scary to think that the things we do are all centered around keeping ourselves alive.

We eat, drink, find friends, find mates, reproduce, and sleep. When you think about it in the context of the natural world, it goes like this: find sustenance to stay alive, find a tribe to stay alive, reproduce so that your genes can continue, and rest so that you can do it all again the next day. Everything else in between just seem like permutations of those very basic instincts.

Why does an artist create art? They all seem to have their own reasonings, some of which seem pretty deep, but at face value, is it really just because they find the things they create to be nothing more than ""cool""? Almost everything I've ever been into, when you break them down into their most basic form, only drew me in because I perceived them as ""interesting"" and/or ""cool.""

1693580606.0,Update: Help on a moment I can’t understand,"So I posted on here not too long ago about an almost episode panic attack moment I had but I didn’t describe it very well, I described it as feeling insignificant and having a loud voice in my head but I just popped out the exact feeling I had that can finally tell y’all what happened fully, so y’all can maybe understand and shine some light

This is the explanation the best I can, bare with me:
Imagine doing something in the span of 4 seconds, but then it feeling like those 4 seconds are the longest moment of your entire life, that’s how I felt when I woke up that one morning, like I everything had slowed down to the point where the first of the 4 seconds, was like it was taking a lifetime to reach even a single second if counting. This is one of those things where it’s more a feeling so it’s very hard to grasp a explanation of it, but trust me as I’m trying my best, because I’ve had dreams with this feeling before years ago and I’ve finally gotten enough conscious to finally speak about it and get it off my mind. 
Almost as if time and time around it is going so strongly slow, and you feel every single thing around you, you are moving but you feel the time, the slowness, and it feels hopeless as you realize you are stuck here, moving slowly, 4 seconds has turned into years, 20 years in and you have only reached the 3rd second of 4 seconds, that’s the best I can explain it, and that’s how I felt that one morning waking up, panicking, a voice inside my head getting louder, and that’s the feeling I felt, please if anyone can even fathom what I’m trying to say, please, I’m all ears",1

1693530756.0,Existentialism and science,"Existentialism is a concept that I have always been intrigued by. A while ago Mathematics and Physics sparked a further interest in existentialism. My main talking points:

1. Interactionism.
2. The problem with applying physics to philosophy. 

According to science, everything has a cause. 
What is the relationship between the body and mind then? Given that the body is physical, and the mind is non-physical, how can they interact with each other?

How can something that is not physical interact with something that is physical? This is, as you probably already know, called the interaction problem. 

Some people conclude therefore, based on physics, that the mind is simply a product of the process of our brains - that choices simply are an illusion. That free will is an illusion, because choices are already pre-determined given that everything has a cause. 

Other people do believe that the mind and body are different substances, and still are able to interact with each other. Perhaps there is a bridge between the physical and the non-physical that enables interaction between the two. 

If you base your philosophy only on science, the study of the physical world, then you are likely to believe that everything is determined.

However, I think this is a wrong approach when it comes to existentialism. 

The way I view it is that we are here on earth as humans, just trying to make sense of our existence. To help understand the physical world better, we have science. 
However, science is inherently limited to our senses. Our perception of the world is only based on our senses and how our brains interact with that information. We can only perceive the world to a limited extent. 

When it comes to consciousness, science is unable to explain it. You can therefore say: “if science can’t explain it, it probably does not exist.”

I fundamentally disagree. As mentioned before, science is the study of the physical world. Consciousness is a concept that most think of as non-physical. We may not have physical evidence to support the concept of consciousness, but that doesn’t mean it can’t exist. 

We have created the notion of consciousness because we experience it. We make choices, we think, we have feelings which we experience.

Science can’t explain it with its current formulas and equations. In fact, it may even conclude that the consciousness can’t exist due to these formulas and equations. 

But I don’t think science should be applied to non-physical concepts. We created science which is limited. The world is so much more than we can perceive, including the non-physical. Some things just exist and lack of a physical explanation doesn’t take away the concept’s credibility. 

Therefore, I think that making philosophical conclusions based on only physics is the wrong approach.

I tried as eloquently as I possibly could, explain my thought process. I realize that there may be some flaws. Perhaps in my conclusions, or in my writing. In either case feel free to correct my mistakes. In fact, I’d highly appreciate it. I came here to be challenged and to improve my writing skills. I am only 16 years old so there’s likely to be mistakes.",1

3. Serious-Goofy. People will not take my wisdom the way I want them to unless I am being serious. The downsides to me being serious are boring, hard, energy costly, large stakes, and stressful. I prefer to be goofy, but when I am goofy it is more mental energy costing for me control the conversation enough to get to the point I want to.

4. We fear moments. We fear the moment when we arrive at our car and our key is locked inside. We fear the moment when we have to say bye to a friend or go back to work. 

5. Ignoring negativity. It is possible to conduct oneself in a manner in which nothing another person says can impact oneself if one chooses. It is possible for one to be impacted by another person. It is not possible for one to ""make"" another person feel an emotion. One can facilitate, motivation, guide, teach, bully, or encouage one to have an emotion, but no person can make another person feel. What is the difference between make/force a person to feel an emotion verses encourage, guide, or teach an emotion?

Have you ever felt what it's like to have your entire essence and sense of being dissolve? I'll try to explain this to the best of my ability. Imagine this scene. You're laying on a patch of grass, you can feel the cool grass blades against your skin as you lay there, unmoving. As you relax and dive deep into your mind you no longer feel as yourselve. You're now the grass beneath you, the wind that blows, the leafs that gently rustle against one another... You feel connected to everything around you.. In that state I lose sense of reality and completely dissolve in feelings, shapes and forms that I have a hard time describing with my concious mind. The feeling of freedom, pure bliss, happiness and content is indescribable. I no longer feel as a separate particle, as a meaningless cog in a stupid machine, but as one with everything around me. The equilibrium I experience in that state is... I think I can compare that feeling to smoking weed, I guess. The best weed you can find, for a long period of time.

What I find hard to cope with is coming back from that state into this fucked reality that I must abide by. How do you cope with all this?

 I cannot enter that state if there are people near me, it is like their desperate attempts to shun the voice in their heads away prevents me from connecting with everything around me. As if they disturb my balance, jam my signal, my connection. The majority of time when around people I must remain hidden behind several masks to preserve myself, because I am able to, sadly, understand them on a very deep level. It is like their entire personality, problems, motives for acting the way they do. Everything. Is laid out bare for me to observe. Where the hatred and resentment of people might come from, why they feel that way, what made them lash out at that exact moment. By just looking at people's facial features I can discern the majority of their personality.  It is quite sad, because often I would try to understand people and show them that there's an easy way to feel at peace and be at balance with everything around you. You just have to remove all the jammers, to truly listen and to dissolve.

But the real problem comes there. Once you feel that feeling, that there is something beyond what we can comprehend as human beings, beyond what I could ever understand at this level of existence. How am I meant not to be suicidal when the prospect of death opens an indescribable amount of unkowns and it excites me so much...?

1693513593.0,Looking for reading recommendations on this specific concept.,"I was led to existentialism by some digging into my thoughts on purpose and meaning, and the nature of those thoughts lining up most closely with existentialist thought, from cursory reading. Specifically, I find the search for meaning itself to be pointless. Why does life, or anything in it, need meaning, why do people want a higher purpose or meaning of life so much that consider it a need? A lot of what I've found in existentialism (in this vein) focuses on finding your own meaning, or giving meaning to things, rather than going with societal norms for that meaning, but that's not what I'm looking for, that still implies that meaning is important, or that meaninglessness is a thing to find your way out of, when I see no need, abs have no desire for meaning at all. Is there anything I can read that delves into this viewpoint? I don't have any strong preference for fiction or nonfiction. Thank you.",1
1693500117.0,I am struggling with this,"I hate my own self-righteousness. 

I think my parents’ principles are inconsistent, irrational and antiquated. I think many of my generation’s principles are Hedonistic, lazy and cause a low attention span. I think many mental illnesses are not as tragic as mainstream media portrays, but are in fact a matter of low emotional intelligence and a low level of consciousness. Anorexia, for example (if this is personal to you and offends you, Im sorry), is caused by society. If one simply strips social expectations and constraints of their power through introspection and self-liberation, they become immune to this disorder. If one cannot do this, it is because their emotional intelligence and self-awareness is low. This is probably bad of me to say, in a lot of people’s opinions, but I truly believe it. 

Most of my closest friends consider me to be of utmost intelligence, wisdom, integrity, insightfulness and many other great qualities. However, when I assert unpopular opinions that I consider to be unpopular truths (such as those concerning the existence of objective morality, objectivity in art and aesthetics, politics, religion and other topics of philosophical controversy) I am often rightfully met with criticism. Criticisms such as elitism and self-righteousness. I truly believe I am better than the average person, and I do not believe it is bad for me to think that so long as it is justified. 

I do not abuse substances irresponsibly; I do not waste my time on TikTok; I read critically; I safely explore the world of psychedelia (fully conscious of the risks, being just 17 years old); I do not allow my moral, practical, educational, social or financial decisions to be motivated by ego, hubris, lust, envy, greed; I work my hardest and make no excuses due to laziness or weakness; I accept my flaws and try to work on them. I do so many things to be the best person I can possibly be. 

Is it truly wrong for me to think of myself as being above and superior to those who do not even try to do these things? Is it wrong to consider myself more morally righteous, intellectually strong and psychologically conscious than those whose principles and self-identity are defined based on racial and sexual prejudices; an economic class they were born into; institutional testimony from governments and churches; egotistical perceptions of themselves; the words of big names in mainstream media and the not-so-impartial evaluations of news stations and social influencers? 

Is that truly bad?",1
1693465823.0,Maybe stop over-asking/thinking about meaning/the point/reason of something/doing something/being somethings is a good thing for you.,"This is what I think: to seek meaning/point/explanation/justification/significance of doing/being something is a psychological mechanism to makes you feel good/confident/significant about the thing that you want to do/to be. This is part of human nature, but keep in mind that this function is influenced by many factors, and sometime the outcome could come out cheap. Some examples I could give is the people who gives their life to their countries or religions in the old days (or current days), because countries and religions are ""good-enough"" reasons to justify their actions and choices. Or evidences are ""good-enough"" to suggest that those women are witches in the Middle-Ages. Nazi and communist or capitalism propaganda are convincing-enough to their followers, etc..  


See what I am doing here? I just want to point out that human is a reason-seeking creature, even the reasons are sometimes poor. And probably people seek reason not because they are clever, but they are vulnerable for them.

Another suggestion that I would give, is to not consider your mind/brain, language and logic are sufficient enough to give you reason of doing something. In other words, just don't sit at sofa and think what is actually worth doing in life. I have that experience, and I am sure a lot of you did. ""Oh.. just give me a reason, or something worth doing, I will devote my whole life to it"". 

I believe that you do things because you do things (if more explanation needed, go to neuroscience), I would say you don't need to convince yourself or other people with ""reasons"".

Another interesting thing I notice and experience, is that ""well but I don't know what to do?"" This question alone is fun, I would say this is multi-factorial. I don't have an answer, maybe there are so many choices? Maybe we are smart and skeptical, so that we won't devote to anythings easily? Maybe there are so many entertainment in life, we need some abstinence for ourselves in order to gain motivation again? I don't know, but we have time to figure it out.

Maybe the most cruical thing that I really want to say is, understand yourself, understand the ""seek-reason"" mechanism that you have, accept it, use it, but don't think it is the ultimate perfect mechanism and suffer when ""that thing"" couldn't give you answer to/in life, and feel lost in own mind.

1693440658.0,Why I think a universe with a GOD is not something I want,"I'm a hardcore atheist.  But let's not discuss the truth or falsehood of God, but rather why I wouldn't even hope there is.

Religious people are often shocked to hear this.  Many people's conception of God lies solely within hope itself.

IF there is a God, one of two things MUST be true:

A) God was the start and created the universe and ethics themselves.  What is good and what is bad was solely upon God to decide.

B) What is Good and what is Bad existed as part of reality and God is bring those ethics with him upon his creation.

c\*) (updated 3rd option: counter argument #3 \[below\]) Ethics are human made.

Most religious people get defensive at B.  Probably because God would lose his title as highest power and be limited to constructs of the universe that made him.

Let's go to A.  God made it all including the concept of Good and Evil.

Now we have a universe that some egotistical unknown entity ""decided"" what actions you take are correct and which are incorrect.  You have been enslaved by this God.  You may have free will, but you will still face his judgement and incorrect actions will bring you eternal horror.

Who in their right mind asks to be enslaved?

I am free.  I just deal with the existential dilemmas of nihilism, but I am free.

Hoping for God is hoping for enslavement.  A king that sets the rules and takes away our freedom.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 8/31:

Ok I can't keep up with all the replies, but I've noticed they all say one of only a couple things So I'll get ahead of some of these arguments....

1. If you use the bible or bible verses, I counter with quotes from Harry Potter to prove that wizards are real.
2. ""I have a limited view of God and what that means"".  If God has so many definitions, the word GOD is useless.   Here's a word, ""nslkdnfoe"" I made it up and its super hard to pronounce.  Its definition is anything you subjectively want it to be.  Should we add it to the dictionary?  No, because words are sounds that convey ideas from one person to another.  If a word has multiple fluid meanings, its useless as it is not a sound that conveys an idea from one person to another.

When God was shown NOT to be a dude on a cloud (we created in his imagine) he just became more abstract and heaven was in the cosmos.  We checked he wasn't there so now Heaven is another ""dimension"".

I'm not interested in chasing God into the semantics of the metaphysical.  That's just human thought and word play.

By God I mean:

A. monotheistic

B. It is an entity

C. it is conscious

D. It had something to do with the creation of our reality

*\*\*I'm letting us off the hook on ""god creating humans in his image"" since we proved that false way beyond a reasonable doubt with evolution.  Also its paradoxical as we no longer view God as a dude on a cloud.  So if he's abstract we were obviously NOT created in his image or we would be abstract interdimensional everywhere all the time floating looking things.   So I'm generous here and not using that in the definition.*

&#x200B;

3. Ethics are a Human construct.

Well, if God dictated the reality mechanics, its his construction.

If he allowed us to navigate freely with free will and we just came up with the system of morality, we will still have to settle for his decision of what afterlife is.

If God simple created us and walked away from the universe, that's within my definition as well, however, at this point whether I live in a universe with or without God seems to have no different outcomes.  In which case, I'm still justified in picking the universe without God, cuz the choices are equivalent.

&#x200B;

PS, I've done things Id consider bad, not evil, but I've made mistakes.  The parental God did not scold me, or do anything that I could see.  He doesn't talk to me.  If he's real, he's so quiet I can't see the difference with or without him.

People tell me I'll see when I get to the afterlife, but I've noticed almost all (I think all) of those people are people that are not dead so could not know.  So I'm having trouble trusting their call.

1693431293.0,Why Why?,"\*Quick update on the people thumbs downing this.  I love when people can't argue the logic, they just ""don't like it"" so they dislike the comment.  Such a strange way to exist only believing what you'd like.

&#x200B;

Words are used to denote a concept or idea with a sound so we can translate that concept or idea to another person.

Many people seem to lose this principle when they start reflecting deeply.

WHY?  What is the definition of this and WHY is it the question asked so often.

""why?"" in regards to the universe really has no more validity than asking the color or flavor of the universe.

If I ask why something happened, the ultimate answer will bring us to the ""first cause"", the big bang or beginning of the multiverse or whatever.

I've found that most people using this question mean one of two things or a combination:

What was the intention?  or What was the initial cause?

To ask the intention is to already assume a god-like theory as non-conscious objects have no intention.  So without God, intention is a meaningless question.

As to the first cause, this becomes fairly ambiguous.

First of all God cannot be proved to be the first cause simply because of the rule, ""everything needs a first cause"".  For example, If there is not God, how did the universe start.

This is paradoxical and a self-defeating argument.  If the rule is everything needs a cause, then God needs a cause and could not be the first thing.  If God doesn't need a beginning, then why did you say everything needed a beginning and thus we don't need to tag on this God-theory because now the universe CAN have started itself or lasted forever.

The words ""Why"" and ""God"" are meaningless as everyone has their own idea of what that word means.  And as I said to being with,

words are sounds to communicate particular ideas.  If that sound no longer functions as a communication of a an agreed upon idea, the word is now just a sound with no meaning.

&#x200B;

Why is this?  Just cause.

&#x200B;

\*Fun addition:

The universe has no meaning and no purpose if God does not exist and therefore these questions also do not need to be asked.

What is meaning/purpose?  They are similar to intention, but more than that, in order to ask the question of the meaning of the universe, one first has to assume the universe is NOT real.

Why did I say that?

What is meaning?  Well we often talk about meaning of something like a book, play, work of art, movie, or some off handed remark that ""meant"" something other than the literal words used.

This means that the direct literally reality of the thing to which we want to apply meaning, is only a representation of the ""true thing""

What did ""2001 Space Odyssey"" mean?  Well it was about a plot of humans traversing space, but the author meant it as a comment of the transcendence of the species, as an example.

So, what does our universe mean?

Well, nothing.  It is real.  It is the literal objective reality.  There is no plot behind it.

So non-religious philosophy has little reason to ask:

the meaning, the purpose, or the ""why"" of the universe as these questions have no ""meaning"" to begin with that is applicable to the situation of reality.

Long answer: 
If there was a meaning, who says you would you be able to live up to it? Let's say there's inherent meaning to life: let's say you're objectively born to do x. If theres was a punishment for not doing it, that would mean you would have no freedom to do whatever you want. You'd only be happy if you COULD and WANTED TO live according to the meaning of life. These are two conditions that would need to align. Of course, if there was no punishment for not living according to the meaning of life, then it wouldn't matter and you could just do whatever you want.

I understand that this subreddit is full of people suffering from uncertainty, confusion and depersonalisation, but it is natural to feel these kinds of things. It's okay not to know the truth. I know that the anguish of not knowing is due to a lack of control in our day-to-day lives, and I think that leads us to focus excessively on ourselves, on our identity as something that can be ""significant"" or ""important"".

The mistake is to forget the roots from which we spring. We are nothing without the environment from which we are nurtured and relate. The world is our context, it creates and guides us, it is everything to our subjective experience! We cannot imagine alternatives to life itself then. If we already understand that we are part of a big system on a universal scale, we will see that our life is just a small cog.

Everything we have (computers, sofas, education, hospitals...) is a product of society, not of ""human beings"". We are not superior because we know more than other animals, but because of our ability to communicate, which has allowed the cumulative abstraction of very complex concepts. Our burden as an individual is small, life did not give us the ability to rise above our nature. A protozoan is not so different.

1693002482.0,Embracing Life: Letting Go of Existential Overthinking and Living in the Present,"

In a world where information is at our fingertips and possibilities seem endless, it's easy to fall into the trap of overthinking, especially when it comes to existential matters. Existential pondering often revolves around persistent thoughts and questions about the meaning of life, reality, and one's existence. While seeking answers is a natural human inclination, it's important to remember that dwelling excessively on these questions can hinder us from fully experiencing and enjoying the present moment.

As human beings, we possess incredible minds capable of profound contemplation. However, this gift can turn into a burden when we get caught up in a cycle of endlessly analyzing the nature of reality. It's true that we are complex beings with intricate neural networks, yet our existence extends beyond the boundaries of our minds. Life happens not only within our thoughts but also in the experiences we share, the emotions we feel, and the connections we make.

Rather than getting lost in a labyrinth of hypothetical scenarios and alternative realities, we must recognize the value of embracing the one reality we have - the life we are living right now. Life is a blend of pain and happiness, challenges and triumphs. By fixating on abstract questions, we risk missing out on the simple joys that are right in front of us.

The allure of seeking answers to existential questions is understandable, but there's a time and place for everything. Constantly ruminating on the mysteries of the universe can prevent us from engaging in the world around us. It's essential to strike a balance between introspection and immersion in the present moment. Instead of allowing existential pondering to dictate our thoughts, we can choose to live with intention, pursuing experiences that bring us fulfillment.

One potential reason for succumbing to the clutches of excessive existential thinking is the comfort we find in our own minds. In many parts of the world, individuals are preoccupied with basic survival, making existential contemplation a luxury they cannot afford. This contrast highlights the privilege of those who have the freedom to explore such questions. However, this privilege should not become a hindrance. It's vital to acknowledge our blessings while also recognizing that excessive contemplation can lead to unnecessary suffering.

The key lies in actively participating in life. Engaging with our surroundings, forming connections with others, and pursuing our passions can offer a sense of purpose that counters the grip of existential pondering. Instead of allowing our minds to spiral into unending analysis, we can channel our energy into creative pursuits, personal growth, and meaningful interactions.

In conclusion, while existential questions are an inherent part of the human experience, it's important to strike a balance between introspection and living in the moment. We have the capacity for deep thought, but we must not let this gift rob us of the joy of living. The pursuit of answers should not overshadow the pursuit of a life well-lived. By embracing the present and actively participating in the world around us, we can free ourselves from the chains of excessive existential thinking and truly experience the beauty of life.",1

We exist and some of us are afraid to die because of the unknown of what happens to consciousness after death. Some of us, for that reason, dont want to die but if you live then you will question it and be terrified. But reality makes us live and die, so we have to experience both. Nature has laws/mathematics that we can't even understand fully. We create our own language of logic and math to try to use laws of nature to solve problems but we can never know why it is. There is no way to prove axioms like 1 + 1 = 2 because the only way to prove it is with mathematics and mathematics is made up of axioms, we just discover it and accept it but never know why and yet it governs us and literally everything we do.

A lot of us like to play-pretend with enjoying our lives, I think this is to avoid existential dreads about what are we making out of our lives

But I feel like with age and with the changing times, life becomes more bleak and soulless, but the question then becomes is this because we start to see life more for what it is and don't engage in this wishful thinking about life and the highest hopes for the universe like we once did or is this a product of gaining more intellectual curiosity and philosophical prospects of life over time?

1) this is my first time on this subreddit.

2) Im 17 years old and NOT a fucking ancient philosopher who somehow digested centuries of research covering belief.

3) I expect to be criticized in both nice and harsh ways. I accept that and even invite that.

4) I'm still working out and discovering my beliefs everyday, which means some of this could be foolish or purely incorrect. If thats so, that doesnt mean i'm retarded, it means I haven't happened upon the information I need to accept the idea was foolish.

Let me explain my current beliefs. I view myself as an existentialist. I don't view myself as this because I think I'm cool or I think it makes me unique. No good has ever come out of trying to have an existential conversation with other dumbass highschoolers in my grade. I view myself as an existentialist because I believe that there is no inherent meaning to life or existence. I do, however, believe that meaning can be somewhat internally and temporarily found through the discovery of passion. I believe that the discovery of this 'passion' is not inherent either.

This universe is extremely confusing, absurd, unfathomable and lacks instruction (a clear objective). I despise the many mysteries and unanswered questions that the universe dangles in front of my face as I beg to fall asleep. I hate that I don't have access to the truth of why everything is the way anything is. Why nothing was apparently something before everything. For some time this made me so angry that I turned to nihilism. I was younger and even MORE uneducated on that matter than I am now, and I just wanted to reject the idea of meaning in the most brutal way I could. I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle it. Yet, eventually my mind found some ease. I realized that these questions are and will forever be unanswered to me - to everyone.

So wait what about the almost revolting title? Im fucking getting to it...

For most of my life, my grandparents on my mothers side were fantastic. They were such lovely people that only cared that I grew up happy. Eventually, both of them got a little too old. They both had heart attacks and multiple strokes, but they survived. It was hard for me and my brother to cope with how sudden this was. At the beginning of summer, my sophomore year I believe, we visited them and had the most wonderful time. By the end of summer, we weren't sure we would ever see them again. We never even got to see them much before, other than occasional talks on the phone, because my mom wasn't exactly terribly close to them.

Holy shit I'm getting there. Bear with me...

Eventually they were back in somewhat okay health. No visits were on the horizon, but they were able to start calling to talk. Immediately, the only thing they would ever do now was preach their lord and savior Jesus Christ. I would tell them about my fantastic day that I had at school and how I had gotten an A on the project I was so stressed about... they would attribute MY success to god and then carry on telling me about how when I die there's gonna be some eternal guy whos like ""Did you see that, I did that shit"" and i'm gonna be like ""Huh, see what? Who are you?""... ""Im God. I just crafted that entire storyline you followed. Your welcome"". Piss off. Please excuse my apparent aggression, this is just me releasing my current contemplation through my fingers and into the keyboard. And yes, I know that's a complete mockery of what different religions believe happens at the end of the line... apologies. The point is that I refuse to attribute anything I do to some God we 'have faith' exists. I create my existence and choices.

My grandparents are afraid. I hate how harsh this sounds when I type it, but this is what I believe. My grandparents brushed death. Life snapped its fingers and both of them realized that in a moment's notice they wouldn't exist anymore. Life will be OVER. Everything they have done is definitive. Everything they do from now on is the final strokes of the pen on the final page of their story. So they panicked. They clung to anything that would disprove that this is the end of the line. They turned to mankind's distraction, religion. Now life isn't over, it's simply reaching its next supposedly eternal chapter. It's a religion that provides a fake sense of internal satisfaction. ""yea, I said those shitty things. I did those shitty things. I hated, and loved at all the wrong times. I allowed myself to succumb to many, many 'sins'. But ya know. Gods got me"". Please, please, please continue to understand that this isn't backed by any Q&A with my grandparents. It's simply my hypothesis. My belief. I don't agree with the way religion allows you to pretend it's all under control. It isn't.

In conclusion here. I invite ridicule or agreement with anything I said. Its like 10pm where I am and I spent the whole school day listening... not to the teachers... to my thoughts. these are those thoughts. I finally deemed it necessary to externalize my thoughts and really gather a public opinion on the matter. Am I insane? Eh... Do I think I'm an ancient philosopher who somehow digested centuries of research covering belief. No, I already fucking said... I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! That's the point. I want to know what im talking about.

We try to convince ourselves that we are meaningless and everything is either meaningless or God’s Will; never accepting our responsibility to create a future we can all survive.

We together form an embryonic Singularity for an embryonic Universe, and we collectively say “Fuck That.” 

We have one evolutionary instruction that makes completing this evolutionary transition automatic and everyone knows it whether they choose to acknowledge it or not; “Be kind and take care of each other.” 
Never yet since Nature evolved us up and we have had the responsibility to create our future have we followed that instruction. 

7000 years of religions, revolutions, and even science, we have never learned to quit using war and slavery to subsidize our lives and luxuries.

1692644056.0,Slaying my demons enlisted.,"I remember as a kid, I could lay down and lose myself in the sensation of floating up to the ceiling at will. I would observe my immediate surroundings, enjoying the feeling of falling down into my body. Those were innocent times, a time of kindness and curiosity, untouched by anxiety or worry. My soul was brimming with curiosity, eager to explore the vast world that lay ahead.
There was so much to discover. Hours would slip away as I watched ants and other bugs on the ground, observing bees as they went about their busy work. I was gentle, never stung, enamoured by colours, captivated by flowers and trees. Freedom was mine, and happiness a constant companion.

But then came the moment when I was told, ""No."" Don't touch the bees, they warned, or you'll get stung. Avoid dirt, they cautioned, or you'll fall ill. In an instant, innocence gave way to suspicion, concepts I had yet to grasp. I was told I wasn't important, pushed toward the chains of obedience, shown a world of religion and punishment. My freedom slowly eroded, and I was left with the notion of being trapped, surrounded by unseen demons, the ones they made me believe in.

Leaving home in search of independence, I thought I'd reclaim my freedom. Yet, society too held its own demons. The concept of masculinity, feminism, borders, racism, body image, religions, classes, money – the list grew endlessly. Walls arose around me, constructed from fear of hurt and loss, confining me from the world beyond.

Yearning for that lost innocence, for freedom and exploration without anxiety or suspicion, I've devoted my life's remainder to the pursuit. I strive to dismantle these walls, to release the demons instilled in me. Naive? Perhaps. But I'll treat all with the best intentions, granting trust without the need for its concept.

This is me letting go, tearing down barriers. Whatever may come, I am prepared. If I'm hurt, then this world wasn't meant for me. Society, it's your failure, not mine. So if you encounter me, extend your best intentions. Who am I? I am everyone and everything. I am you.",1

""We can take a moment now and then to consider where we are and where we would like to be. It is these moments of stepping back, and looking at our lives, that can help us clear the fog and choose a path forward. But which path?""

""We tend to think we know what makes us feel fulfilled, what is good for us, and what is bad for us. No one knows us, we think, quite like we know ourselves. The problem is we’re so good at being ourselves, we don’t always see that there might be another way.""

Shunryu Suzuki: “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few.”

Lesson 1: LIVING AN EXAMINED LIFE
""Asking honest questions about ourselves is the first step toward recognizing that we may not be experts on our own lives. When we accept this, and we accept that we may not have all the answers, we step into the realm of possibility. And that is a step in the right direction.""

Lesson 2: IN PURSUIT OF SOMETHING BIGGER
""Some of us have lived the majority of our lives and find ourselves looking back, others have most of our lives in front of us and are looking forward. For all of us, regardless of age, it helps to remember that the question 'Do I matter?"", of leaving something for future generations and of being part of something bigger than ourselves, is not just about our personal achievements—it’s about what we mean to other people. And it’s never too late to start now and leave a mark.""

Lesson 3: FILLING IN THE GAPS
""Good relationships keep us happier, healthier, and help us live longer. This is true across the lifespan, and across cultures and contexts, which means it is almost certainly true for you, and for nearly every human being who has ever lived.""

Lesson 4: THE NEED FOR RELATIONSHIPS
""We are born with a need to connect with other people. Because this need for connection is fundamental to a flourishing life, social fitness should be taught to children and be a central consideration in public policy right alongside exercise, diet, and other health recommendations.""

Lesson 5: ADVERSITY ON THE PATH TO THE GOOD LIFE
""Thousands of stories from the Harvard Study show us that the good life is not found by providing ourselves with leisure and ease. Rather, it arises from the act of facing inevitable challenges, and from fully inhabiting the moments of our lives. It appears, quietly, as we learn how to love and how to open ourselves to being loved, as we grow from our experiences, and as we stand in solidarity with others through the inevitable string of joys and adversities in every human life.""

A FINAL DECISION 
""How do you move further along on your own path toward a good life?
First, by recognizing that the good life is not a destination. It is the path itself, and the people who are walking it with you.
As you walk, second by second you can decide to whom and to what you give your attention. Week by week you can prioritize your relationships and choose to be with the people who matter. Year by year you can find purpose and meaning through the lives that you enrich and the relationships that you cultivate.
By developing your curiosity and reaching out to others—family, loved ones, coworkers, friends, acquaintances, even strangers—with one thoughtful question at a time, one moment of devoted, authentic attention at a time, you strengthen the foundation of a good life.""",1

1692505759.0,coffee and life,"🌟 Embracing Happiness and Letting Go of Existential Doubt 🌟

Dear friends,

Today marks a significant chapter in my journey, one where I choose happiness over the endless maze of existential ponderings. It's easy to get lost in the labyrinth of life's unanswerable questions, to be consumed by thoughts that only seem to lead to more uncertainty. For far too long, I found myself entangled in this web of introspection, searching for a meaning that seemed elusive.

But here's the realization that has set me free: life is too fleeting to be weighed down by the burden of questions without answers. The very nature of our existence is a marvel, and while we may never fully unravel its mysteries, it's the beauty of the journey that truly matters.

I've made a conscious decision to break free from the chains of existential dilemma. I choose to focus on the present, on the laughter shared with loved ones, the moments of joy that light up our days, and the simple pleasures that make life worth living.

It's liberating to accept that there are questions beyond our grasp, and perhaps that's where their magic lies. Just as the cosmos holds its secrets, I've come to acknowledge that some truths may remain veiled until the end of times. And that's okay. For in the grand tapestry of existence, we play our part, embracing the unknown with open hearts.

Some philosophers, while offering insights, can inadvertently become viruses for the mind. I've come to understand that it's more enriching to live a life filled with experiences than to spend it endlessly seeking the ""why"" behind those experiences. The pursuit of happiness and growth, the laughter, the tears, the shared moments — these are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives.

And as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, I'm reminded of the simple joys that await each day. I'm grateful for another chance to participate in the exhilarating game of life, to savor its tastes, sights, and sounds. This perspective only becomes clear once we shift our gaze and view life through a different lens.

So here's to a future filled with happiness, to cherishing every sunrise and finding wonder in life's smallest details. Let us lift the weight of the inexplicable from our shoulders and savor the journey for what it is — an extraordinary adventure that defies easy explanation.

With newfound clarity and a heart full of optimism,

1692426466.0,Mortality,"I (24M) have struggled with my own mortality since I was around 8 years old. I don't know what triggered me to start thinking about it so young. Before I would get deathly afraid of the thought of it. I would be absolutely terrified, in my bed, not being able to shake the thought of it out of my head. I would start coddling myself and holding my head in fear as if it was right around the corner. It was like that for a while. More recently though, I've been thinking more about the absence of life rather than being dead. I was scared of the inevitable (and still am from time to time) but it's more rather about not being able to experience anything anymore. When I'm dead I won't be worrying about anything, because I can't.   


I guess I stems from worrying about not living a fulfilling life? I wouldn't know the deeper psychological meaning of why I think this way, though I'm sure most have had a thought about it from time to time in their lives. But I am constantly thinking about it. As I said before I used to be extremely afraid of it but I got really annoyed that I was living in fear almost every day and something changed. I realized the moment it changed but now I can't remember what clicked. From time to time I still get afraid of it but now it's more relaxed or worried thoughts. I don't know man.   


Another odd thing is, nowadays whenever I get into bed to start to go to sleep, that's when I think about it, without fail. I don't know what it is about the bed that gets me there every time. The correlation between sleep and death? The fact that it kinda feels like I'm being placed in a casket? I really don't know.   


I've tried to see what I could do about these thoughts, on and off for a little while now and I think I made a huge breakthrough with swithci9ng from fear of it, to the worries, but there's still some further part of it that I still don't understand. I know I won't be able to completely get rid of these feelings but I want to be able to try and understand them more. I don't want to get to the end of my life, not having thought about it, and then come to the realization I'm going to die soon, and go kicking and screaming. Who the fuck wants that? I know I don't. I've met people and seen people who claim they have either overcome the fear of death to the fullest extent we possibly can, or at least found some kind of peace. Either they've found a revolutionary way of dealing with it that comes with age or certain experiences, or they are all just lying. I really hope its the former. I I really hope I can get there one day. We all will march through the gates of life to the eternal beyond, whatever it is. I'm no different form every single living being in the history of the universe. Everything has and will die. I just want to be able to come to some kind of terms with it.   


What are your thoughts? Does anyone here have any wisdom they can bestow upon me? I would really be glad to hear it. Have a good day everyone. Treat people and yourselves with love and care. That's all anyone ever really wants. ",1

1692401608.0,The Temporality of Consciousness and the Continuity of Existential Experience ( Self written idea),"*I have been working on a theory of mine for the past months that I feel like i finally solved. If there is any critique, please let me know. This is my first philosophical work I have ever written.*

**The Temporality of Consciousness and the Continuity of Existential Experience**

The perception of time, as Kant might argue, is an intrinsic part of our human experience. Our entire life is based on clocks, dates and calendars. However, as you might know, our perception of time changes when we are less aware or when our consciousness ceases. Consider a dreamless sleep, where many hours can feel like a few minutes passing. Might this feeling of time passing be even faster in the absence of consciousness all together?

**The Instantaneity of Existential Transition**

Building on the idea that time feels different or even instant when we are not conscious, there emerges an interesting idea about the continuity of consciousness. If a consciousness cannot perceive its non-existence due to its absence (of existence), then any subsequent revival of such consciousness, irrespective of objective time passing, would be perceived as instant. As a thought experiment, say that the chances of a consciousness re-emerging after death are near infinitely small, and say that it takes an near infinitely long time to happen, for the experiencing consciousness that ceased, it would feel instant. A councious being can only be councious, because it can simply not experience not being councious, thus making existence eternal. 

This explanation does not claim validation, because it treads on grounds that modern science cannot measure or proof. Instead, it's asking us to think deeply about the mysteries of life, what it means to be conscious, and how we experience time. By asking these big questions about life, death, and time, we get new ideas about the ongoing journey to understand ourselves.

1692400275.0,Summer reflection,"Hello everyone, people of good and bad, I take advantage of my anonymity to open widely my thoughts and feelings about life. 

Time has passed... It is 2023, I am at least 20 years old. In quiet moments I often think deeply about the consequences of being alive, that is when I realistically imagine death and that well of infinite human incompleteness. When I remember my age, it gives me a wake-up call; it whispers to me the uncertainty of my lived days.

Why am I alive, why am I conscious? There are people who talk about the meaning of life, which is an explanation for our survival in the world. The truth, I believe, is that ""meaning"" is a human construct that is either meaningless in relation to objective reality, or so distorted that it does not even touch the logical characteristics that define the universe.

Why are we so far from the truth? Heh... When I hear people say that happiness is the meaning of life, I can't help but feel a mixture of sadness and indignation. It's like I don't understand the reasons that make them feel secure in their hedonism. It makes me wonder, are people aware of their nature? I really don't think so. 

We are not aware of how enormously influenced we are by evolution and its biology. To exemplify, we tend to see the world as a large-scale lego, where we presuppose that the concepts we conceive of are rigid and superimposable. When I look at a person's face, I can see the uniformity of the whole and recognise it as such, but the reality is far from what we perceive. Underneath that face is a coordinated set of fluids, muscles, bones, cartilage.... In a different conformation, we would see a very unpleasant image that would unleash contrary and terrifying emotions.

Emotions (such as happiness or fear), colours, space, time, etc., become perceptions that have an impact on us. They become perceptions that make evolutionary sense, but which we normalise as something that has always ""been there"".

There are also people who tend to abuse metaphysics, thus speaking of infinity or finitude, which is why some end up in nihilism... It can't be that simple. We are not timeless beings; we do not understand the magnitude of the problem if time (and space) is the means by which we instinctively reason EVERYTHING we imagine. We cannot suppress time in order to put an end to paradoxes that make us believe that the universe is infinite.

It is not about having the answers, but about being aware of the problems. 

Right now I feel an emptiness that fills me in a strange way. I can't help but feel doubtful and worried about my passage in life, but that is my context, it is everything to me. Does this mystery satisfy me...? I guess I'm not too far from the hedonism I repudiate either.",1

Our willingness to accept and act out truth is not perfect. All of us have at one time told a lie, at another behaved dishonestly. In ignorance, we act on untruths and half-truths seeded by people who thought they knew more than they did. It is abundantly clear that we cannot be the source of our own correction.

Looking to universally understood objective facts is also in vain, as applying them requires subjective interpretation. If we had the infrastructure and technology to ensure the perfect health of every person on earth, we still wouldn't know to what end we do it. The critical thing that distinguishes a life of authentic purpose from a vacuous spree of hedonistic indulgence is beyond us.

Of course, nihilism isn’t too far of a walk from existentialism, but it doesn’t necessarily have to lead to that.

Not just on Earth, but in the whole universe, multiverse, and so on. So everything, no matter how big or small. 
Question: would the world still exist? 
I guess this question doesn't make sense. One could say, of course it would still exist, even if only floating rocks remain (or not even that, just atoms far-far from each other). But is that really existence without any perceiver? 
Maybe after some time a lightning would struck just in the right place and there would be life again. Maybe life emerges from the physical world only and it happens more often than we would think. But still, for at least some time, there is no perceiver, so can we say the world exists for that moment? Can we say the world really exists after every living thing dies?

We are born without anything, we come to this world naked in all senses, at what moment in life do we learn what things matter?

I have had this question all my life, and recently, I figured out I might not be the only one, but I’m certainly the only one in my close circle, my family, my friends, my coworkers, they all seem to live the same reality but me, they get up, go to work, come back home and wait for payday. That’s it.

Is that really what life is?

I meet someone online, a young man who lives thousands of miles away, who lives a life I could only dream of, in a big city with a creative job that pays, meanwhile I’m in this small town seating in front of a computer from 9 to 5, earning the minimum to reach ends meet every month. Over and over again, in a cycle that never ends. I’ve always have had these thoughts, but I always hope they would go away as years started to accumulate behind me, I saw myself as a “rebellious” teenager, always questioning my existence, begging the universe to bring me peace of mind, to make me “normal” like the rest of the people I knew, to take away from me the burden of my own existence. And I have to go even further back, when I was a small child, I was told I was gifted, smart and with a bright future ahead of me, definitely a burden no kid should ever bare, I didn’t wanted to be gifted, I wanted to be happy, I wanted to be ignorant of the things grown ups told me were important. But that burden only got heavier, all my life I’ve been trying to figure out how to get rid of it, fighting and running from it but it always seems to find me, and now with social media, smartphones, and information everywhere I look, it is even harder. There is no escape. I write this hoping to find someone out there that can show me a way out of whatever this is, some people call it a simulation, some other call it capitalism, I don’t know what it is or where does it come from but I didn’t chose it and I don’t want it, and I want to relieve my children from it, and all future generations.

But tbh, taking time out for yourself and simply being good and present for yourself is also highly important and can be understated. Just making your life about which goal you achieve next is actually considered another form of dopamine chasing more centered around the ability to delay gratification - but you’re still chasing a hit.

1692026486.0,Why God is Unique,"# Why Believe in God?

What sets belief in God apart from belief in any myth? God, being the eternal First Cause, is the cause of all belief in Him. The likes of leprechauns and fairies are beside the point. One who believes in a myth believes in his belief in it, while one who believes in God believes in the cause of his belief.


# With so Much Evil, How is God Good?

To address the problem of evil, it helps to understand what evil even is. Here are some examples of unambiguous evil:

The serial killer derives pleasure from depriving his victims of life.   
The rapist derives pleasure from violating his victims' bodies.   
The controlling sadist derives pleasure from depriving another of his freedom.

All three of these deprive their victims of the means of purpose. So we may conclude evil is manifest in a will against the purpose of things.
If the purpose of all things was ordained by God, then it's nonsensical to say God is evil, that He wills against His own will. Even in considering the possibility of an ""evil God,"" by what means would we know it to be true, that good and evil are defined (since God is the source of all purpose) by adherence or lack thereof to His will? It is perfectly rational to believe God is invariably good, and all evil seen in Him is the result of error and deception.


# All Hope is in God

You might be tempted to say ""I can live a good life on my own."" If not in God, where do you place your hope? What assurance is there in probability, when every die will roll a 6? If you wish to leave behind a legacy for future generations, what is there to ensure no one destroys it? If you wish to live for the thrill of it, what hope do you have after you're gone? If there is a God, wouldn't you take Him over the fleeting speck of a life you otherwise have? I know He's there, not because I wish for it, but because He's revealed a hope for Him that I've always had.",1

I can't explain just how fucking beyond terrifying these panic attacks are, it's like it's actually surpassed panic and turned into something way way more nightmarish and hellish, when I have these panic attacks it truly honestly feels like *the most scariest possible feeling that can ever be had in existence* like no other being has been as scared as me in that moment, truly the most horrifying fucking fear ever, worse than actual hell, and this happened multiple times throughout the day and night

1691981865.0,Capitalism. Existentialism. SUFFERING.,"
I, like many of you, have been inadvertently placed on this cumrag of a planet to be a clockwork wage slave. The consequence of my existence is just that: to serve as a means of achieving what is not mine. A paycheck, as rewarding as it may seem to some, is not something to be proud of, for any set amount of newly displayed digits that appear on your checking account are to only be allocated for the sake of monetized survival. Humans have essentially monetized everything in existence, including your very own existence. Water, which is found nearly everywhere, still comes at a cost. Air conditioning, which is fundamental to one’s health, comes at a cost. Health itself comes at a cost, and at a big personal expense at that. Sanity comes at a cost. What I find to be incredibly fascinating is that the preponderance of human beings, regardless of menial occupation (however, heedful of pay rate, workload, and status), can and must work five to six days a week to make ends meet, with only a mere day or so off, while of course still failing to make ends meet.

We were not taught money in school because the government does not want us all to be rich. The majority of the work undergone by those who frequent this subreddit seems to be menial jobs; regardless, it is devoid of anything positive, and understandably so. The feelings of helplessness naturally intensify when one goes about working their menial job, and observes their bosses or “leaders” nonchalantly going about their day not suffering one bit; as the subordinates {the menial worker} of the said individual/s in ‘power’ {i.e., bosses}, stress in anguish as they are yelled at or disrespected constantly by customers, guests, and even the said bosses, who trivialize the menial worker's existence so that expectations can be met at the expense of inhumane suffering. Ironically, the menial worker's, or subordinates, financial expectations are almost never met. Conversely, if a menial worker is having a bad day on a Monday, or any day for that matter, how is that said individual supposed to get through the next day, all the way up until maybe that Friday, or even Saturday— in a sane, fair-minded way without the usage of pharmaceuticals, without self-harm, and without resorting to violence? Because conformity is an essential byproduct of monetized survival, wage slaves, such as myself, must suppress our natural human instincts in the face of adversity due to the consequential prospects of employment termination and the elimination of income. In other words, we have been conditioned since grade school to be robotic in nature to serve these purposes, and I have finally opened my eyes.

To my belief, capitalism is chiefly responsible for all of this, to an extent. Although, socialism was created in response to capitalism, I personally believe that even if the economic climates were to have been swapped, humans, especially those in power, would still find ways to manipulate, abuse, and screw over us helpless, brainwashed, conditioned, and frustrated individuals. Conformity, at least in my eyes, is synonymous with tolerance. By collectively conforming to this evil system as a whole, we are therefore tolerating the system as it is. However, the only effective means of action for any of this is through force, which is seen in the eyes of the rich as evil; moral hypocrites. Socioeconomic disparity, as a term, is seen as nonexistent in the eyes of those in power. Furthermore, those in power who express “suffering” do not in fact suffer, regardless of micro-, managers, leaders}, or macro-classifications of power {CEOs}. “Suffering” expressed and “felt” by those in power is subjective; suffering felt by those outside of that spectrum is objective. To conclude, one day, the sun will set, and the torches will be lit. Us young individuals will become powerful in the height of our uniforms made red.",1
1691979643.0,Your Point of View May Be Crucial,"I went for a walk today, I had a rather simple thought and I figured it might help some of you.

When we think about quantum particles or the universe, about death and meaning - we tend to feel very little and insignificant. My emotions? Biochemistry. Free will? Doesn't exist. Achievements? Death. God? Only the laws and riddles of reality. Why is there anything? What is even existence? Nothing matters!

However, this is probably just the ""wrong"" perspective. We should not try to minimize the greatness of existence measuring it with extremes. You probably would not look at your beautiful Lego castle and react in the same way. ""Nothing but bricks after all."" No! You would admire what arose to be. 

So, we should probably not think little about life and shit, which is inherently awesome, because there are limits to our understanding. You experience qualia, you love, you hate, you ask. This is the actual summit of creation. Viewing particles and the universe and time and whatever else we can not fully grasp as necessities for beauty is a way more positive approach than deconstructing beauty until it's gone.",1

1691961251.0,How strong are your convictions?,"I have a value system I adhere to pretty well I think. I try and hold empathy, humility, and self-awareness as the main tenets I live by. I have never been religious, despite being raised among mostly fairweather Catholics and an incredibly devout mother-figure. No one could ever explain to me good reasons, in my opinion, why they believed in a Christian God and could never provide satisfactory explanations for the hypocrisy and cruelty their religion seemed to condone. I’ve considered myself agnostic since middle school when I first learned what it meant and have not moved away from the label since. I am most comfortable resting in liminal spaces or ambiguity. I prefer exploring and analyzing the effects a mystery has on those experiencing it more so than trying to solve it. I like open endings and the feeling that I am a small piece in an incomprehensible maze. I understand this isn’t how everyone feels, and that people may feel untethered or anxious in these spaces, so I don’t often challenge people on why they cling to the answers they do for the big questions.

While I am confident I cannot and will not know the mysteries of the universe, if there is one or multiple deities or dimensions, if anything happens after we die, etc. I do feel more connected to some beliefs than others and have a general structure around my own spirituality and theories for what happens that make sense to me, but I have always thought it was incredibly…arrogant, I guess, to hold real conviction toward any of them, especially to the point of promoting my beliefs for others or proselytizing. 

I am interested to hear from others who’ve felt like this, because I realize I don’t meet many. And those who’ve felt like this and then later found a belief system that clicked that they now fully believe in, how’d that happen? What changed? Are you happier or less afraid?

I am also wondering how those who are religious and spend a lot of time theorizing about life and death and the meaning or meaninglessness of it all handle their beliefs. How do you hold faith and confidence that what you believe is going on is actually what is going on? How do you challenge those beliefs, if you do, and why? Are you uncomfortable acknowledging that you can’t possibly know and will never know? How do you process doubt and what makes you reaffirm your beliefs when it creeps in? How do you reconcile philosophies that you connect with, but are incongruent with the dogma you’ve chosen?

Hi! i've made similar posts in some other subreddits trying to get insight, but to put the rest of what i'm about to say into context, I'd like to learn more about philosophy but have no idea what to start with, especially given that it's not known for being an easy subject to read. I am 20 years old and halfway through a chemistry degree, I really like what I do and want to go into clinical research but have never been hugely passionate about one specific career, which makes it kind of tough when thinking about how to figure out what i'll be doing 40 hours a week the rest of my life. I know that part maybe has more to do with the politics of this country, but it's a grim reality right now and that being said I want to do everything I can to make sure I have a genuinely fulfilling job and in turn a happy life. No pressure! So, it's impossible to think about that part of my future without getting all existential. I know very little about philosophy in an academic sense, but have heard a bit about existentialism, specifically Camus, and I guess I agree with what seems to be his take which is that there is no definitive meaning to life (worth mentioning that I am not religious) and one's purpose is to do whatever doesn't make you suicidal. I honestly think this is a good perspective to have; I only have one life and should do everything I want to do and make the most of each day. But I know it's really not that simple, and recently i've had this looming fear of ending up with a job I don't like as much as I thought I would, and regretting that I maybe can't change my situation or go back to school, etc. Basically, I think that getting into philosophy would probably give me some insight but don't know where to start.

Nobody handles climate change anxiety by talking to sociologists, it is treated as a mental health problem like any other.

In a recent post, somebody was frustrated over having spent *6 years* here out of desperation with no results, they only stayed because they didn't think anyone else would understand how they felt. Someone else answered that the masses are too stupid to understand philosophy and that their random eclectic philosophy is the solution instead. There's simply nothing about existential crises that are incomprehensible to ordinary people, and the *years* they've wasted listening to snake oil salesmen such as that person are years in which they could have found real support from people who care about their feelings. In fact, a *real* mental health subreddit would have pointed out the nature of his problem almost immediately. This community (although it's mostly the fault of us mods) has really failed this person by not drawing a fine line between philosophy and existential crises.

If you want to support someone with their mental health, or if you're here for a personal reason and want to know what proper support would look like: read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/talking_tips/) excellent post by a hotline advisor. It's about suicide but much of it is generalisable - arguing people's feelings as people do in this subreddit is a terrible idea. If you're obsessed with whether a particular theory is true or not in a way that affects your mental health then you might have [OCD](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-obsession-existential-and-philosophical-ocd/#:~:text=Existential%20OCD%20involves%20intrusive%2C%20repetitive,or%20even%20one's%20own%20existence) \- either way the last thing you should be doing is feeding this obsession with philosophy.

When we start making changes we'll be updating the community and looking for feedback as to make this a shift the community can buy into, so we aren't doing any hard content bans yet. That being said I've spent *hours* everyday deleting posts and writing messages to users explaining how they can best get the help they need,so I'll be removing these posts entirely from now on.

1704665862.0,Subjectivity is the Starting Point,"*The word subjectivism has two meanings, and our opponents play on the two. Subjectivism means, on the one hand, that an individual chooses and makes himself; and, on the other, that it is impossible for man to transcend human subjectivity. The second of these is the essential meaning of existentialism.*

Jean-Paul Sartre, *Existentialism and Human Emotions*

The core of existentialism, to hear Sartre tell it, is that ""subjectivity is the starting point."" Imposing order on the chaos of being and human experience is just dealing with literature. And if you're starting with Reality, some totalizing construct that you consider self-evident, then you're dealing with secular theology.

This isn't some picayune hair-splitting, it's the very crux of existentialism. Subjectivity may be the starting point, but it's certainly not the end; whatever knowledge we have of history is due to human experience being processed through modes of professional and communal inquiry and organized into a third-person account that's extremely useful as long as we realize how artificial (I didn't want to say ""illusory"") it is.

If we get rid of God, we have to get rid of the concept of a God's-eye-view of reality. Everything we know we owe to human perception and experience, and like all human constructs even our so-called objective methods of inquiry are sodden with the biases of the historically and culturally situated agents who conduct them.",1

1704575455.0,The meaning of existence," 

I had a discussion with friend who is an extreme theistic fanatic and I had no idea how to explain to him what is the actual reason for my existence (by the way, I am an atheist, an evolutionary biologist and just someone who has never asked himself why I am here, but all my life I have only tried to explain to myself that theistic beliefs have failed deeply). I have read a little about what are the philosophical explanations of my existence and as an evolutionary biologist, i.e. someone who understands why a certain species exists (which is primarily reproduction and survival) I would call myself an absurdist But as a member of a species that has extreme intelligence, I cannot understand my life only as food and sex, so i would call myself an existentialist (however chaotic and in a way senseless this life may be, in the sense that some star may explode tomorrow in the vicinity that will destroy us all, each of us simply has to find some reason why he is alive, but he has to find it himself, it must not be imposed by any means), but to some extent I also find myself in nihilist (because I don't really believe anything and I don't accept any norms except those that I would have placed).

I apologize if the question is somewhat stupidly asked or if I misunderstood the point of these philosophical directions. In any case, I am interested in whether what I believe can be classified into one group and whether it is legitimate for a person to accept several philosophical directions if they all fit into his beliefs. I would also like to ask you to recommend some books that would explain the meaning of my existence, but in the light of what was written above.",1
1704447033.0,"If ""nothing"" cannot exist without the concept of ""something"", is there truly ""nothing"" after death?","I always used to be a hard core atheist that thought this life is it and after we cease to be it's over forever. Which was very comforting to me, I preferred the idea over an eternal afterlife.

But in my mid twenties my philosophy began to change. I began thinking, it doesn't make much sense. Reality has never been 'nothing', because for 'nothing' to exist as a concept of a lack of 'something', then 'something' must too exist.

The argument people make that ""Death is an empty void just like the empty void that came before life"" is an extremely easy to disprove theory in my opinion. Your brain is what holds your consciousness, it is a material thing. It cannot remember what consciousnesses came before and after, it only stores information locally. So if we lived as infinite consciousnesses forever before and after being a human, our brain simply would never know.

What is your guys's take on this? This is all a bit of a batshit crazy theory but it's what I truly believe, when we die, we will experience 'everything' that can and will exist as long as time and reality is an infinite thing, and through our different consciousnesses, we will likely never remember anything that came before or after.

Or, even more bizzarely, we may be born into a consciousness that randomly had all the thoughts of all its previous and future existences stored locally through complete random chance, and then you would die and be reborn as a bird or some shit. Or you may be reborn in eternal hell or an eternal orgy. Basically anything that can happen will happen.",1

And would you look at that, there's a paper that explores that exact Idea by investigating a pair of conjoined twins that have linked brains.

https://philarchive.org/archive/COCACO-6

It points to the consciousness being Constant a fluid state that is subjected to change, It is a Very scary thought that what holds us together seems to not be in our Control, How our decisions are dependent in past information and How the now only makes Sense because of that, but even at that, It always makes Sense but not because It really does, but because It needs to.
Also It reminds me of a Fun piece of literature that being

Let’s imagine Planet Earth, same as now, same problems with politics and economy, same dark and mysterious universe, same laundry to do, everything as we currently now. 

The only difference, is that we are immortal, so forever doomed to live. 
And I mean, totally immortal, you could jump in a volcano and still you won’t die. Like in GTA, you just wake up outside an hospital in the nearest city in no time. 

Every human would reach a certain age and then stop aging, meaning you won’t live pain and all the problems related to old people.

In my journey to becoming an authentic person, I seem to contradict myself very regularly. Every time I believe myself to be authentic, I find another layer, another perspective that disillusioned me and put me back to square one (square one = emptiness). It is a difficult path to walk.

Therefore I would love to hear the perspectives and personal experiences of the people here.

1. What does authenticity mean to you? and what inspires you to be authentic?
2. How do you deal with the contradictions related to 'self'?
3. What philosopher, who writes about authenticity, inspires you?

1704400295.0,"Yalom's Take: Individual Responsibility in Existentialism?""","Diving into existentialism and getting into Dr. Irvin Yalom's ""Love's Executioner,"" I stumbled upon a passage that got me thinking. Yalom drops this line: ""Since patients tend to resist assuming responsibility, therapists must develop techniques to make patients aware of how they themselves create their own problems."" It's a glimpse into Yalom's take on therapy, putting a strong emphasis on personal responsibility in tackling mental health challenges.

But as I read this, I couldn't shake the feeling that there might be something missing. The complexity of how internalized issues intertwine with external factors, especially for folks facing unique challenges, seemed to take a back seat. The quote kind of suggests that individuals bear the full weight of their problems, making me wonder if Yalom might be inadvertently sidelining the socio-political aspects that contribute to mental health struggles. This concern becomes even more pronounced when considering the experiences of marginalized groups.

Being a newbie to existentialism, I'm eager to figure out if this focus on individual responsibility is a recurring theme in the broader philosophy or if it's more of a Yalom thing. Is it a fundamental aspect of existential thought, or is there room within the philosophy to grapple with the intricacies of socio-political contexts? I'm curious if anyone can shed light on whether Yalom's works generally navigate these complexities or if existentialism tends to lean towards the idea that all problems are self-created.",1

An axiom is a presupposed, given truth. It is not proven, it is assumed to be true for the proceeding endeavor, such as logical reasoning.

The existence of physical reality is predicated on the axiom that it exists. We cannot prove that it exists. We assume that it does. 

All that we know, is that we experience. We assume that just because we have a map, that there is a territory.

Scientific observation requires experience. Measuring equipment is observed.

Experience is not reliable. Therefore, the scientific method is not, in all intellectual honesty, reliable.

Is the scientific method useful? In that paradigm, yes.

We identify with this ""fruit"" and we say we are a separate being. Therefore many people are terrified by the thought of death and disappearing into nothingness forever. Because we are just this little mushroom on the surface, isolated, fragile and helpless against all the predators and dangers, standing there alone not knowing where we came from and where we're heading, not knowing that we are connected with the giant fungal network in the ground, that we in fact are this whole network. 
Another example is golden jewelry. There are all kinds of forms, rings, chains, crosses etc. made from gold. But in fact the nature of all these different items is not its form but the gold itself. The form of the gold is just in our minds, our minds give meaning to it. But it can be molten and remodeled into other shapes and it remains just gold.

The state we are in now, thinking of ourselves as separate beings that have a start and an end, would be fake and the state after and before it would be the reality.

Instead, please read to the end the link I am sharing; give it a few minutes, because the ideas build up. (Hint - it is about what do we do with this magic that we all are. So yes, it is about the meaning of life. You’ll even read a true story of a 10 years old girl who asked herself - why was I born? 🥹❤️ reminding us that indeed, at different stages in life, wherever we are on the map & regardless of the century or decade, we have always asked ourselves this question.)

This quick essay you are about to read is the moral of a free street game (scavenger hunt) that you can browse through as if it was a coffee table book with lots of pictures. 

However, you can read the moral without going through the hunt; it makes sense independently!

(On the other hand, the hunt gradually brings some info about afterlife - based on logic, about the power of inspiring each other with real life examples, about the wonder of being contemporary and perhaps some more ;). 

This could be something good to read ahead of a new year 🤍🪽🫶",1
1703995902.0,Kierkegaard on authenticity: Detachment is only the first step,"Kierkegaard's first major work was his master's thesis, ""[On the Concept of Irony.](https://archive.org/details/kierkegaard-soren-the-concept-of-irony)"" Part Two in particular lays out the program of passionate authenticity that Kierkegaard would explore for the rest of his life.

I mentally divide the program into two steps.

Step One is the mode of being most associated with existentialism in the public mind. He recommends an ironic distance from the world, society, organized religion and even moral values. This allows one to ""negate the world"" and shed the false identities that are imposed upon us.

This rejection of artificial values and counterfeit essences can be found in many practices, ancient and modern. Everything from Buddhism to stoicism to self-help books preach the idea of ""radical detachment.""

But it's Kierkegaard's second step that gives his thought power. He believed that radical detachment must be followed by radical ATTachment.

Kierkegaard described people who never move on from Step One as ""ironists.""

“In order to really and thoroughly to be able to create himself poetically, the ironist must have no an sich. \[in itself\]…. Therefore the ironist frequently becomes nothing, because what is not true for God is true for man — out of nothing comes nothing. But the ironist continually preserves his poetic freedom, and when he notices that he is becoming nothing, he includes that in his poetizing.”

Kierkegaard does \*not\* believe that we're free to become whoever we want or choose our own values -- at least not if we want to have a life with any meaning.

“Irony is indeed free, free from the sorrows of actuality, but also free from its joys, free from its blessing, for inasmuch as it has nothing higher than itself, it can receive no blessing, since it is always the lesser that is blessed by the greater.”

Kierkegaard believed that giving oneself to God was the path to authenticity - as long as this was an authentic faith.

Dostoevsky, the other great Christian proto-existentialist, famously used a Biblical metaphor to describe this two-step path of death and rebirth: ""Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain, but if it dies it bears much fruit.""

What do you think? Personally, I find myself continuously examining my life for inauthenticity and working to live in a genuine way. It's enormously fulfilling.",1
1703993254.0,"How are we supposed to be “okay” with being a living, thinking, breathing, fully conscious being one moment and the next basically becoming an object for an eternity of nothingness?","I sort of wish we knew for 100% sure it was like sleep or unconsciousness or the time before conception, cause yes billions upon billions of years passed and it didn’t feel like any time at all, seemed like time jumped almost instant to the point in time when we were born. But we had nothing so we didn’t care much about the millions of years of human development and events we missed out on. However it’s different after life cause being a human we’re the epitome of consciousness, we’re on the top pf civilisation so we’re very aware and it’s actually programmed into our instincts that we’re gonna die and that it’s gonna be forever.

I’ve been chronically ill and it’s horrifying to think that one day I can start feeling unwell and I might only have a few seconds or few minutes to comprehend that I’m about to enter the eternal void, the nothingness that goes on forever, and I’ll be all alone in it, leaving everyone and everything I’ve loved behind in a whole different realm and world.
As much as my life is full of suffering and I make it worse for others a lot too, I’m still so not ready to step into that other realm alone and for an eternity. Even if it seems like the easy way out sometimes.

I don’t want my brain, body ruined, even though I understand we’re just borrowing this vessel to house our consciousness in.

1703959497.0,Existentialism Theory of Everything vs. Nothing,"I'd like to try to explain a theory of existence that I've been kicking around in my head, and I will do my best to explain it.

Simply, we exist because we have to. Because at the very base of everything is the fact that there is either existence or non-existence. There are the mathematical expressions (forgive me, I will not use the correct mathematical terminology, as I am not an expert in math, or existentialism, or anything related - these are just my ideas) for ZERO, and then anything but zero. There's Yin and Yang, positive and negative, etc. We exist because there IS and because there is NOT. What I mean by that, is the moment there became anything positive or negative, observable or non-observable, with or without matter or energy, there instantaneously became something that is either negative or positive. I believe this is fairly well supported in math and that most proven theories have a counterpart in mathematics. Afterall, there cannot be something if there is no such thing as nothing. 

Last night, I was watching an episode of ""Under the Dome"", and I started wondering to myself what side of the dome would be more affected by the fact that these people were stuck in a dome with no communication. Would the impact of such a situation be greater on these people inside the dome or outside the dome? Mathematically, there is far more outside of that point in space-time than there is inside, so wouldn't it be safe to assume that the greater effect is on what is outside of the dome? We can call this dark matter or dark energy in this theory. 

https://preview.redd.it/2u9e2l5b2h9c1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=083c967606055d8def2d907109410748e86bd9a8

**My theory is that we exist at the intersection of oneness, and nothingness, and that everything we see, feel, observe, etc. is all a result of those two universal forces pulling on each other.** 

I think that the thing that we should be doing our best to understand and map is the **nothing**, the zero, the anti-matter, the anti-anything. For example, at any given point in space time, there may be something observable or there may be nothing. If we are considering that which is observed, I think we need to only look at what ISNT observable. The Yang, the negative, the infinite. That is where the math stops because we cannot breach that terminal line in space and time. We only call it dark matter or dark energy. What if we were able to plot everything that ISNT at a given point in space time (I know the math would be unimaginable large and require more computing power than is likely possible)? 

Basically, what I'm saying, is the REAL is everything that we currently perceive as not. Imagine taking a very large, very intricate black and white picture, where most of the picture is black, but there is an obvious observable image made of up white pixels. Now, take that picture and invert the colors so that everything that was previously black is white and vice-versa. Now, do this with everything that is observable in the universe at a given point in space and time. Everything would assume it's mathematical or observable opposite and THAT is what we would look at. Blues would be orange, blacks would be white, reds would be green and so on, but with ***everything***. something that would be classified as a 2 would be a -2. Everything with matter (or mass) would be measured as the complete opposite. Something that appeared as having zero matter, zero energy, or zero mass would be measured as having infinite matter, mass, or energy. Do this with everything and map it. I know, it's a lot, but the universe is a big thing. 

This is why I tend to believe that we are a program. The reason there is unobservable anything is because it's on the other side of what is ""real"" and what is programmed"". Because of this terminal point in space/time, we can and will never be able to observe anything on the other side. It's written into the coding at the very beginning and acts (through mathematics) as a boundary that cannot be crossed. It will never matter how much progress we make in the sciences of gravity, light, or other fundamental forces because they are all, at one point, even if VERY difficult, observable. They're observable because they are of the basic coding/building blocks of our ""existence"". I would even venture to guess that we are ""alien"" or ""viral"" lines of code. Self-replicating, quickly spreading, malignant-at-times, lines of code that have the ability to destroy or create other like code. I believe that when UAPs, religious, biblical, and other instances of ""seemingly impossible"" or other-worldly occurrences have happened is due to active interference by a force capable of changing our coding or the coding of the ""world"" we live in. These things are being coded into existence and then ""displayed"" for us through our abilities to observe in order to push civilization in one way or another. This active interference is more of a reason to consider that we may be a program. Is it more likely that aliens from outer space are coming to visit us, or is it more likely that whatever we are witnessing (more often than ever before) is something that's already here, overlaid on top of our existence, but on the other side of the mathematical wall that prevents us from observing them? I think that's where the ""real"" in the universe exists and that we are only lines of code. 

We've all heard the Ufologists talk about, ""What could be so dark that they refuse to let the world know?"" Well, think about it for a moment. Imagine that scientists were able to confidently discern that we were almost certainly programmed into existence? What if our purpose was simple to be the oil in a machine? How would people feel about knowing that another force could end us instantly at any time? What if what seems like an eternity to humans (thousands even millions of years) is experienced to our creators in the same way that we experience hours? What if the end of our civilization was determined simply by when our programmers become bored of their latest hobby? I think this is one of the darker paths that have been postulated and I think it's dark enough for a secret to be kept.

1703946635.0,Who is Man who we are and speak of,"I wish to know of your perspectives on the concept of Man, whether you can answer or dissolve the question of the meaning of Man. Who or what is Man? Heidegger: the being for whom Being is an issue (Dasein). The Socratics: the rational animal (*animal rationale*). Cassirer: the symbolic animal (*animal symbolicum*).

However you answer, whether you undertake the synthetic approach (wherein Man is seen as a totality) as opposed to the ""reductionistic"" analytic approach (wherein Man is seen as a mere composite of parts), it does not matter. I simply wish to know what you think of Man. Do we reduce the answer to a biologism or psychologism? 

If I am to give a definition, I am less for the tendency to mathematically define Man as an abstract, bloodless, rigid, formal genus through a theoretical/disembodied view-from-nowhere than for the tendency to otherwise conceive of Man in his very concreteness, in flesh and bones, as a living, breathing being, as we see a fellow human being, understanding Man from ourselves, through ourselves. 

I posit that we already have a good know-how/tacit knowledge of Man. It shows in our dealings in our everydayness and how we treat different things differently. Otherwise, how will we even question the concept of Man? This is to circumvent Meno's Paradox. Heidegger did the same thing but with Being. I'm merely regurgitating to make a point. One might say that all what is left of us, then, is to uncover from the surface phenomena the underlying patterns of psycho-statistical registers or social functionings. One might even say that we can penetrate through the fluidity and multiplicity of Man to reach the universality/essence of Man by means of dialogical inquiry.",1

1703878641.0,"Birthdays Make Life Feel More Absurd than Usual, Why Am I Still Here at 24?","Turned 24 today and I've found myself from last night and waking up this morning to now in almost a constant state of laughter about how absurd this all is. 

It started in the shower last night enjoying scrubbing my head with shampoo and the hot water running down my body and just thought to myself that I'm happy to be in a hot shower and to have made it to 24. But then in great absurdist fashion I found myself thinking at any moment a freak accident could occur, that it's possible shampoo could come running down into my eye, I could freak out, slip, fall, and break my neck and die. And I think in the past before I started thinking about philosophies like existentialism and absurdism this thought would've made me paranoid, but instead I couldn't stop myself from giggling about it.

I think the giggling turned into a general laughing about why have I made it to 24 and how absurd it is that I'm still here when I currently have no real goal or movement towards something greater than my current life. And also how absurd it is that many people who did have aspirations centered around a greater goal or movement are no longer with us.

You hear stories all the time of honor roll college students or teenagers with huge aspirations being victim to freak accidents or crime or violence. You hear stories of people who are in roles or were wishing to become occupations like doctors, lawyers, scientists, et cetera dying tragic deaths. You hear or watch stories of children dying due to wars or child labor across the world. All people with a ton of potential towards the ""greater good"" of the world, people who are hard workers. 

And then I think about myself. I will preface it with I have worked hard for many things and had many goals accomplished. I did very good in grade school and got into a great university. I busted my ass working through college and with my full time job afterwards to be able to afford a house and set myself up for a decent life. However this year, now that this is all done, I've realized that these were essentially all of the goals I had. In addition to this I also feel like I've felt everything I've always wanted to whether it was love or accomplishment or ecstasy, so I'm just sort of lost.

So I think this birthday has settled in me that I'm just quite ambivalent towards life currently and I'm finding the conflict of it absurd. On one hand I'm enjoying how inconsequential my life feels now, but on the other there is a bit of guiltiness as to being on this Earth and knowing how consequential life can be if you work hard for it, but I don't wish to work hard anymore, so why essentially am I still here?

I’m gonna dive into existentialist philosophy(and contrasting stances) in my gap year come September, here’s my plan so far:","I’m going to begin with At The Existentialist Cafe by Sarah Bakewell because it is apparently a rather comprehensive but easy introduction. I will then move onto the father of existentialism with Søren Kierkegaard’s Either/Or (primarily because of the Elliot Smith album), followed by The Concept of Anxiety. Next, I’ll read Existentialism and Humanism by Jean-Paul Sartre because it is not as long as his other essential works. I’ll then read The Myth of Sisyphus and The Stranger by Albert Camus for a second time, followed by my first read of The Rebel. Afterwards, having already read Metamorphosis countless times, I’ll give The Trial a second read and The Castle I’ll read for the first time. Having hopefully cultivated better existentialist literacy at this point (and I’ll have hopefully already read some of his Essays and Aphorisms), I’ll get into Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation. This is mainly because I’m conscious of how essential his influence is to absurdism (which I’ll have just covered) and Nietzsche (who I’ll be getting into next. This is where I’m a little uncertain. I’m hesitant to move into his more dense and difficult works until after my undergraduate, so I’m thinking of starting with The Antichrist and Beyond Good and Evil, but I’m unsure if this is a good place to start. Finally, Im gonna give Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre a go (and give up a tenth of the way through hahaha).

1703821533.0,What do you guys think?,"New here, just looking for a place to share some feelings and ideas with others and see if anything resonates. All opinions welcomed, just wanted an opportunity to write some thoughts down for once and see what happens.

I was always atheist and nihilistic growing up, but as I've got older, I've become convinced that there is some kind of higher power beyond this life, just not necessarily in the guise of any of the established religions practiced around the world.

While I can't effectively describe what I sense this higher power to be, the only thing I feel certain of is that how we morally behave in this life determines what comes next (whatever that may be). Essentially the same as heaven and hell, but just not confined to how it is portrayed in Christianity. 

For example, if this life was just a simulation run by an advanced species, I still think at the end you would be judged on how kind, honest, fair and hardworking you were, as opposed to how financially successful you were, etc.

Since developing this view, I've realised that most of my values align with the virtues of many religions - so while I do not consider myself religious per se, I fully appreciate and respect what it means for people to try and 'walk with god' and to strive to be good people in spite of the hardships of their lives. (I hate it when people automatically dismiss religion as something negative or outdated without fair appreciation for what it can offer those who practice it in the right way).

We are all born into vastly uneven circumstances and it all appears so random and often grossly unfair, so I can understand why some people are skeptical of a god - but the only leveller I can see for nearly everyone is our capacity to choose whether to be a good person or not, and that for me is the true measure of a person. If you can be a grateful, caring, courageous person born into poverty, disability and adversity, you are living a much more successful life than a selfish, covetous millionaire born into total security and comfort - in my view.

This world is completely random and at times, downright chaos. But what better way to judge someone's character than by seeing how they behave when dropped into a completely random arena with no clear set of instructions on how to behave? That's what I think this life is.

Challenging to condense this post down into the main points I hoped to get across without rambling, although I fear I may already be doing that so I'd better leave it there. Just glad of an opportunity to verbalise these thoughts and see if anyone else shares my non-theistic view of morality and a potential afterlife, which also happens to share some similarities with the views of some religions.

She would’ve been a grandmother. I’ve lost 6 close friends/family members due to gun violence or opioids in the past 5 years, starting to doubt if an afterlife is real or just wishful thinking.

Just being forever imprisoned as a void that doesn't exist and can never exist anymore and knowing that that is what will happen. No rebirth, no heaven, no hell, nothing tangible to grasp onto or get. 

I have this immobilized fear of it when I really actually think about how it feels to be on that timeline, to really think about knowing that. My need for control, only to know that I live to become nothingness forever, to never understand the warmth of the sun ever again, or play in the snow.",1

Meaning that there is no right or wrong and life is pointless. It’s opposite (existentialism) is the believe that there is no fate, destiny, higher power, etc, creating meaning in our human existence. Instead, it’s through our experiences in the here-and-now in which we create our own meaning in life. Nihilism is empty, existentialism is full of hope. Rant over.",1

In fact, I don't understand why this idea is considered the most ""rational"". 

Many assume that as our neurons no longer work, everything stops. Indefinitely. For eternity: Nothing.

I specify once again that I have no problem with this idea but I wonder why this idea is considered by many to be the most ""rational"". Why is the field of vision not wider?

When we die, we will no longer exist, it is factual. But can we really think that from non-existence nothing is possible anymore? In this case, if we think that then how to explain that from the inexistence we ended up existing at our birth?

Can we really believe in an eternal nothingness (or to make more ""poetic"" in an eternal rest)? If the universe is not eternal, how can we think that non-existence is eternal?

In fact, I think that even non-existence is not eternal, I see our birth as a formal proof that non-existence cannot be an eternal purpose.

I know what a pansy, but it does feel great to say those things, instead of keeping them in my head all twisted and raging. Its relieving to be quite honest. I know you the reader, knows absolutely nothing about me. But these are the thoughts that race in my head continuously. And I feel like writing them down. I want to explain how I feel, what I think, and hopefully find peace, true peace of mind. Whatever that means, especially in todays society, where you cant be given the time of day to actually sit down and decompress thoughts and feelings appropriately. I know theres stuff like therapy, which I do not have the means to go and do, that’s why I am here. Talking in a mess of OCD rantings. 

Anyways, do you know what is a weird? Getting thoughts or feelings that feel, well, weird, thoughts that you can’t really explain properly, but the thought is just so intense or off putting.  Is that just me? Like an example is the thought of being alive, me, you, a sentient being in an unknown universe, full of unknowing possibilities. And that thought that all that keeps me here to experience this is my heart pumping blood throughout my body to my brain, that thought to me is scary, it is insane to me. It makes me feel insecure, like I have no control over myself and everything that happens in my life. I know that’s OCD probably, and anxiety as well, the unwillingness to accept uncertainty. These should be natural thoughts, but I keep them pent up in my head, like a tense ball of energy. I am a tense ball of energy. I don’t like to be so existential all of the time about everything, but I am, and I can control the thoughts I get, so why not write them down? It feels so terrifying thinking about all of these crazy uncertainties. Its like I see something others don’t, why me? Am I cursed? Or is it a gift I haven’t seen yet. Because I truly love this life, there’s so many cool things out there in this universe I want to experience and see. People, animals, environments, the earth, stars, moons, the universe. Where am I in all of this, stuck in my room contemplating if I am insane (I most certainly am). But this feels good, talking about the thoughts. 

I still feel stuck in my life, like I don’t know where its going, like purgatory, am I a bird trapped in a cage? Or am I a bird that’s sitting in the cage with the door unlocked but that’s too scared to check if I can be free? I guess we will have to see who releases me from my cage.

[?](https://preview.redd.it/yq5vk1czs88c1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef268dd44c883bce88aebe9ab6850f79f44d80c)

This article is intended for philosophical discussion only and does not suggest that one cannot enjoy life or should cease living; if you are experiencing psychological distress, please seek professional help before delving into these profound topics.

## The Proof:

1. **Foundation in Determinism and Physicalism:** As established, all phenomena, including human consciousness and decision-making, are governed by deterministic physical laws. This framework negates the existence of free will and independent agency.
2. **The Illusion of the Self:** The 'self' is an emergent property of complex neurological processes, not an independent entity. This understanding implies that the beliefs, desires, and motivations we attribute to our 'selves' are also products of deterministic processes.
3. **Absurdity of Self-Created Meaning:** Since the self is not an independent entity, and our thoughts and desires are products of deterministic processes, the concept of creating one's own meaning is inherently flawed. The idea of ""creating meaning"" presumes an agency and self that are illusory.
4. **Meaning as a Human Construct:** Any meaning that individuals believe they are creating is itself a result of deterministic processes. It is not an authentic expression of free will or personal agency, but rather a byproduct of the same deterministic laws governing all other phenomena.
5. **Circularity and Lack of Foundation:** The act of creating meaning is based on the premise of having a self capable of independent thought and decision-making. Since this premise is invalid (as per the deterministic and physicalist view), the act of creating meaning becomes a circular and baseless endeavor.
6. **Inherent Meaninglessness Remains Unresolved:** Consequently, attempting to create one's own meaning does not address the fundamental issue of life's inherent meaninglessness. It is merely a distraction or a coping mechanism, not a logical or effective solution to the existential dilemma.

**Conclusion:**

* **Futility of Creating Meaning:** In a deterministic and physicalist framework, where the self is an illusion and free will does not exist, the endeavor to create one's own meaning is both absurd and meaningless. It does not provide a genuine escape from the inherent meaninglessness of life, but rather represents an illogical and futile attempt to impose order on an indifferent universe.
* **The Paradox of Perceived Control:** While we are essentially prisoners in the deterministic game of life, our inability to perceive ourselves purely as biological machines compels us to live as if we possess independent agency. This paradoxical situation allows us to continue our lives under the illusion of control. However, the awareness that this control is indeed an illusion shatters the enchantment of our existence. This realization makes it challenging to overcome the sense of life's meaninglessness. In this context, there is no ultimate solution or definitive goal. Distinctions between choices like not to continue life, indulging in hedonism, adopting stoicism, or embracing any other worldview become inconsequential.

Ultimately, in a deterministic universe where free will is an illusion, nothing holds intrinsic significance or value. This perspective leads to the conclusion that all choices are equally meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

1703276291.0,Ontological Experiences (Example: 'You were born in the wrong era') - Discussion & Invitation,"I've been a lurker here for a while, and recently felt inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/18ojbix/we_should_legitimately_name_this_place_rnihilism/) (versions of which pop up now and again) bemoaning what some see as unconstructive/self-indulgent posts, wherein OPs maunder nihilistically in their existential angst. The main objection apparently being that the resignation, despair, hopelessness (etc.,) being expressed falls short of the kind of committed engagement with and exploration of said angst-inducing experiences that existential philosophy is all about.

I don't want to add more fuel to the fire, as I truly believe many who make such 'venting' style posts about their angst are motivated by genuine, overwhelming suffering. Like so many of us, they are sensitive to burdensome ontological truths of the human condition, and are wrestling with them.

That said (and in response to the critique being voiced and echoed in the [aforementioned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/18ojbix/we_should_legitimately_name_this_place_rnihilism/)), maybe we could give a more 'committed engagement' and 'exploration' a shot?

As an example, I was playing the video game *Fate/Samurai Remnant* earlier today, and had to pause when one character said to another, in a mournful, commiserating tone: ""You were born in the wrong era"". I was struck by the inchoate anxiety I experienced as I tried to imagine myself being told such a thing, while identifying with it as true. Of being a person whose values and sensibilities seem to clash so greatly with the mores of the prevailing culture that I would feel utterly unmoored in my own worldly existence. In this regard, I think Heidegger did an excellent job when he characterized such 'uncanny' experiences of ontological anxiety (wherein meaningful and coherent orientation in the world collapses) as: ""the 'nothing and nowhere' \[...of...\] 'not-being-at-home'"" (*BT*, p.233) in one's being-in-the-world.

Then, as I dwelled further with this unsettling experience I was trying to vicariously immerse myself in, another emotional layer of the ontological experience began to surface. Somehow, as much as it might feel comforting to be told by someone, in a commiserating tone: ""You were born in the wrong era"", I also feel that there is something very disquieting about receiving that message from the Other. Specifically, the experience of someone else encapsulating the totality of your disquiet with your own worldly existence in a pithy, 7 word platitude (a disquiet you yourself may yet to have actually put into words, up until now). This is the kind of self-alienation/dislocation Sartre discusses in his analysis of 'the Look'. Certainly, what can feel dislocating about 'the Look' is when the Other's objectification of you is incorrect, yet you cannot control it. This means reckoning with the ontological truth that part of who we are is our 'being-for-others', and the Other's judgement(s) can be wildly in contrast with our own self-construal. Yet in the example I give, the Other is instead correct. The person who says: ""You were born in the wrong era"" is identifying something about you, which you may have latently felt, yet never articulated until now. And somehow, I imagine that feeling awful as well. In fact, precisely because it is accurate, it feels as if the Other has somehow 'taken' a discomfiting truth about my worldly existence, and bludgeoned me with it, blindsiding me with an existential realization I would much rather hide from (and may have been somewhat successfully hiding from until now). Yes, the comment was made with the intent to commiserate my misery, but in a way, it has only intensified it by making me more conscious of it, now that I have the actual words to articulate and ruminate over it.

And yet, dwelling further still with this example, additional experiential layers begin to surface. Let's take the phrase once again: ""You were born in the wrong era"". Really dwell with this and where does your mind take you? For me, I begin to try and imaginatively construct the succession of 'eras' in human history, over time, in an effort to properly contextualize what it means to be born into one 'era' in particular. I begin to appreciate the really very tiny window of time I am allotted in my worldly existence, when projected against all that has come before, and all that may come after. And somehow, in imagining this, I feel desperately trapped. I come to regard my 'thrownness' (as Heidegger would call it) as a non-consensual prison sentence, delimiting the worldly possibilities I can hope to access, to only those that sync up with the span of my own mortality. No, more than that, that sync up with my geographic location and the material means (e.g., money) that might empower me to expand my horizons even slightly (while still ultimately being delimited by my era). I feel so utterly small and helpless before this small window of opportunity. And yet, what is the alternative? Just a fantasy I could construct of what it might be like to be an omniscient, eternal god-like entity, who is not delimited in the way I, a mortal, am.

And of course, all of this brings me to my mortality, and my 'being-towards-death', which might prompt yet further layers of experiential depth to this ontological experience, triggered by a single line of dialogue in a video game! Indeed, a line of dialogue I have self-indulgently chosen to extemporize about to strangers over the internet with the sheer stubbornness to read this far (thank you by the way!).

Nevertheless, as distressing, and humbling as all of this is, the emotional exploration also leaves me with something else. I notice that I feel a kind of awe at the sheer depth and breadth of what it means to be a human being, only a sliver of which I have been able to explore via my (incomplete) analysis of this example. There is something... oddly fulfilling about having written this post, unpacking the depths of emotion that are part of my existence as a human being, when I really make the effort to dwell with the complexity of my Being. And at least for me, this fulfilment, this facing of disquieting ontological truths disclosed through things even as 'mundane' as one errant line of dialogue in a video game... it leaves me in a state of wonderment. Perhaps it's merely the natural catharsis that comes from putting latent feelings (however disquieting) into words. Or perhaps it is because, as Heidegger says: ""Dasein's Being is care."" (*BT*, p.329). There is a satisfaction in exercising my natural (dare I say 'essential'?) ownmost 'concernful involvement' with my own Being. A gratification in somehow, paradoxically 'coming home' to myself, to what I am as Dasein, to the ontological truth(s) of my Being, even amidst such experiences of 'not-being-at-home' in my existence, as I have explored in this post.

I wonder if anyone else can recall experiences they've had (either those contacted directly, or imagined vicariously) like the one in this post? I truly believe that a careful phenomenological exploration and existential-hermeneutic analysis of even seemingly mundane experiences can un-conceal the hidden depths of our Being. And as inevitably angst-laden as this process is, I firmly believe that committed exploration can lead to a paradoxical form of fulfilment (authenticity perhaps?), like I've found in my own musings here. Maybe we could work together and unpack some other experiences likewise?",1

- if there is no god, how is it possible that you can already look forward to a holiday at the end of 2024, for example. You are actually a year closer to death, but you don't care about this.
Something tells me that our subconscious secretly knows that there is more after this life. Otherwise I don't think you can have these thoughts about looking forward to a holiday if next year.

1703181296.0,Detachment as a way to go through life happily,"I have recently came across this idea since most of my life has been defined by pain, suffering and trauma and I always surrendered to my emotions whether it was falling in love, pleasure, sadness or mainly in my life, crying. 

A few months ago I decided I was fed up of always being hit by life and saw that crying didn’t make me feel any better and definitely didn’t solve anything. I would end up in a state of anxiousness, depression and panic attacks but by controlling my thoughts and impulsivity I have been able to not identify with my trauma. Whenever I started to feel bad I just kept a strong mindset by not allowing myself to cry. And that kind of toughens you up. 

With it, I became detached from reality as well. And I think I plan to live like this the rest of my life, because although my life is weird in kind of a third person, at least it shields me from all emotions (good and bad) blocking the potential for suffering and additional trauma which I will have trouble processing. As I keep ageing, traumas become more severe and difficult to handle, so not adding new ones becomes essential by all means necessary.

Sure, I will not fall in love, find anyone, or make any of the plans I once had, but honestly life is a risky business and after reading about another woman who lost her daughter made me think what’s the point of becoming engaged with reality at all? The pleasures are so short-lived and ephemeral life’s unworthy of taking such risks. It feels life will keep hitting us until we become detached from it so it won’t hurt us anymore and then we may wake up from this illusion.

I am wondering if any of you have been at this crossroad and have voluntarily chosen detachment as a healthier way to rule your own lives rather than handling a life where you are driven by your emotions? I initially joined the antinatalism subreddit but I found out the my AN views have nothing do with world population. It is even made out of selfish motives as keeping antinatalist views can help me better cope with my life events based on this detached perspective I am talking about.

Her dementia hasn't gotten any better, and it's quick to notice her deteriorating state after asking the same questions moments prior. After she left, I began to ponder what it means to think and ""see"" things. I recalled a previous situation I thought of regarding an inebriated person. The idea goes like this:

""You can only see things as they are in the present, only because you'll remember them in the future""

Say you were utterly drunk, and the next day, you woke up in someone else's room with entirely different clothes. You ask your sober friends what happened, and they recall stating that you went absolutely wild, and trashed the whole place. To you, you were utterly oblivious. You had no recollection, you didn't consciously ""see"" any of the events unfold. It was as if you were accelerated to the future without knowing what happened prior. This effect is even further noticeable if someone suffers from total amnesia. To them, they were suddenly in the body of (say) a 26 year old. It was as if they were born that way. It's because they never remembered what they did prior to contracting amnesia, it was as if they never ""saw"" the things happen at all. 

So, what does this have to do with my theory. Well, considering death is the total loss of life, where everything from your senses, to your consciousness AND your memory is erased, shouldn't we have already accelerated to that point? Like if we are all going to die anyway, why haven't we accelerated in that point in time when all our memories will be lost. Yet, we don't, and maybe the possible reason for it is that, we still have consciousness, in whatever form. Consciousness that allows us to see, but more importantly, one that allows us to remember.",1

1703112682.0,"To grasp existentialism, start with essentialism.","Existentialism says: ""Existence precedes essence."" But what exactly does that mean? How do we organize our thoughts to make sense of it?

A good place to start is to first understand essentialism.

To wrap your mind around essentialism, let's consider a famous actor such as Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington.

From an essentialist point of view, one might say that they were born to be actors. *""Tom and Denzel were born to be actors. That's why they became so great. They were born with something inside of them that led them to pursue acting, and ultimately become highly successful actors.""*

In other words they were born with an ""essence"" inside of them. It was this essence that steered them around into the directions they took. It led them to acting and becoming the actors they became.

An essentialist might also say the same thing about a criminal. ""*He was born to be a criminal. That's why he spent his entire life in crime and ended up in prison. He was a criminal from the day he was born.""*

Here's some other examples from the same line of thinking:

* *""He was born to be a leader.""*
* *""He was born to be a doctor.""*

This is not an uncommon way of thinking. We've all said this kind of stuff about people or even ourselves at one point or another. The notion that people are born with some type of life defining essence or soul inside of them is not a new idea. Most people prefer to believe that everyone has a soul. We even entertain the idea of ""old souls"" or ""young souls"". It's a very old concept that goes back to Greek philosophy and Plato and probably even before that.

Plato believed that everyone is born with an essence: [an eternal occupant of our being.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_theory_of_soul)

That's essentialism in a nutshell: We're born with something inside of us that more or less dictates what we end up doing with our lives. It's the essence, the soul, that came first. Essence precedes existence. 

Now that we understand essentialism and essence, how do we grasp existentialism?

You just flip things around. Existence comes first, THEN essence. The big difference is that the essence have been reduced to essentially nothing. Essence is something that you create on your own. It develops during your life, not before.

An existentialist would probably argue that Tom and Denzel were not born with any type of ""actor essence"" inside of them. An existentialist might say: *""Tom and Denzel were born with a clean slate. Everyone is born with a clean slate. We create our own essence as we grow. The essence of our life is formed through the decisions we make during our own unique life experiences.""*

Existentialism pretty much dismisses the idea that a person is born with some kind of essence or life guiding soul. The idea is that everyone is born with nothing. We create our essence on our own.

So why then did Tom and Denzel become actors? It depends upon how you want to think about it, right? Some might say it's always been with them. It was in their soul from the very start. Others might say it's because of their life experiences, who they were around while they were growing up and how both influenced them.

And now think about yourself. Why did you end up becoming who you are? Is there something on the inside that's been guiding you all along? Or did you make every decision all on your own? If not, then where did this internal essence come from? Did someone create it? Or is it just a phenomena of nature?

1703120458.0,The problem with awakening,"The problem when you start awakening to the reality of this world, seeing that none of our actions are actually done by our free will, that everything we do in our lives is constrained by the laws of physics is very disturbing. Knowing that I have no free will, unless I choose to sacrifice myself. But I must do it from an awakening point of view. The most important thing I’m doing lately is not feel emotions for anything at all, good or bad, I try to keep a passive attitude towards life, either good or bad, and the most difficult thing has been to contain my tears when I’ve been very hurt, but somehow I noticed that my life energy was being sucked every time I cried. I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed a similar thing to this awakening because I’m getting the understanding that if I must have free will as I claim to be I must completely set myself free from this world, by my own sacrifice. Anyone else is dealing with this thought?

I decided to write here instead of in the SuicideWatch Reddit because the attitude and the approach is completely different. The end is the same but the way to get to the other is completely different. When I did in the past I was so overwhelmed and in such anxious emotional state that it prevented me from reaching my goal. But now that I’m trying to reach the same goal, be free from this world, although with a complete different mindset, finding peace in my decision, and instead of ending everything impulsively trying to end it being at peace with myself, awakening to the world around me until this reality can no longer hold me because I’m no longer responding to its emotional triggers.

I think if we get to very deep contemplative meditative states we can in fact transcend this limited reality and achieve our goal of being free from the shackles of this world. However, when we act impulsively and try to hurt ourselves, or end our life violently we get exactly the opposite effect because we are emotionally trapping ourselves into this illusory world  and giving it authority over our sovereign self. It may seem counterintuitive but according to the classic oriental teachings this is what they explain about detachment. 

TL;DR If we really want to die then we must detach from this reality by NOT HURTING OURSELVES acting impulsively because SELF-HARM is a TRAP that keep us BONDED to this 3D dimension through OUR EMOTIONS (which are the dark side of the Light/Force)

If we lose track of this stillness, if we begin to have difficulty returning to it, of finding our meaning once more. It is a result of the cacophony of sound within our existence that we lose track of the meaning in our lives. A consistency of motion, a repetition of actions within the chaotic experience of existence, feels reminiscent of this stillness, but it is not stillness. This repetitive predictability in a chaotic existence is a feeling of fluidity, rather than the experience of fluidity itself. For all systems in existence, finding rhythm is their closest experience of stillness. For humans, our.ability to contemplate beyond the confines of existential reality, through awareness, is what allows us to unveil the quietude of stillness. The once laborious constancy of noise whose shadow obscured our existence, may only alleviated when we find the rhythm of stillness beyond our existential experience.

1702996101.0,"James Burke's Connections, and and Existentialist Critique of the Supercomputer Fantasy","I was a huge fan of the *Connections* TV show in the 70s, wherein host James Burke demolished the linear view of progress and explained how innovation depended on interconnections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. As Jennifer Oullette on the [ArsTechnica blog](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/fans-of-connections-rejoice-rebooted-classic-sci-doc-series-returns-with-original-host/) explains:

>\[E\]ach episode would start with some past innovation or event—the invention of the cannon and subsequent changes to castle fortifications to eliminate blind spots, for example. Then Burke would spend the remainder of the episode tracking a path through a series of seemingly unrelated events—maps, limelight, incandescent bulbs, substituting guncotton for ivory in billiard balls, the zoopraxiscope, the telegraph—to demonstrate how they all connected to produce a modern-day breakthrough: the movie projector. 

As an existentialist, I found this focus on progress not as an inexorable algorithmic process but as a contingent operation that depended on the input of countless historically and culturally embedded human agents—none of whom necessarily expected their effort to result in the ""end product""—to be a much more realistic way of conceptualizing change.

This made it all the more disappointing when I watched the first episode of the recent reboot of *Connections* and heard Burke immediately hold forth on how a supercomputer, loaded with data, will be able to predict the future even down to details like the clothes you chose to wear this morning. I'm sorry I don't have a transcript of the episode, but it's a common enough trope in science-fan discourse: with enough data, a supercomputer could predict the future.

Am I the only one who sees this as the kind of machine fantasy that Burke's thesis itself refutes? I thought the whole point of Burke's reverse-engineering of a momentous innovation was to demonstrate how many conceptual, methodological and technological precursors had to be in place before the innovation could exist. If the facts of history had been just a little different, we have every right to conclude that either the innovation would never have happened or it might be radically different than the way it turned out.

The supercomputer fantasy plays into the Dream of Reason that the existentialists found so monstrously unconvincing during the rapid technological progress of the 20th century. It makes *quantity* the magic ingredient in producing the oracular ability that ancient humans found such a tantalizing mystical goal: *enough* data points loaded into a device with *enough* processing power will give us access to the eternal and unchanging Truth about ourselves and our universe.

The problem is that data alone don't arrange, emphasize and interpret themselves. The irony for the Greeks about oracular pronouncements was that knowing details about the future won't prevent humans from making mistakes anyway; the Oracle at Delphi regularly dispensed wisdom about the future that inspired folly and led to disaster for the people who received it. Burke's entire career is founded on his ability to describe how fortuitous and exceptional events have momentous and unforeseen consequences. The Holy Grail of complete knowledge through data processing should inspire skepticism rather than confidence.",1

1702777205.0,"I feel alienated from this world and from any person. It makes me feel really lonely. Nothing is worth an investment, as we all will return to dust.","Well, from any person except my family to be honest. 

I just don't fucking care about anyone. I've got ""friends"", but at least from my POV these are fake friendships because I could drop them in an instant. Heck, I even forget to actively stay in contact with them and it's them always messaging me. 

I also don't feel interested in anything really in this world. I don't have a career wish or perspective. Currently I'm doing my PhD and the most bearable option for me is to somehow stay in academia. But I am definitely not doing my PhD because it's what I wanna do. 

Literally nothing and no one interests me. I don't have any hobbies (except sleeping and YouTube), I am not interested in people, and I also don't feel any romantic or sexual interests (I am an aromantic asexual - my testosterone is fine, I've got it tested). 

I honestly don't know if this falls under the category of being schizoid. It's at least the closest thing I've found which matches me. Either this, or I am just very depressed.

Now the question: Why does nothing and no one interests me at all? The answer: Because I don't know, whether there is an afterlife. If there is no afterlife at all, then nothing matters and I can try to watch YouTube all day long until I die. If reincarnation is true, then this life somehow matters but I'm still going to be upset as I won't meet all the people I've met so far again. If heaven is real, then it's the best option: I'm gonna meet people again and I'd be able to look back at a cool life.

But of course we don't know what will come afterwards and it's ultimately a matter of personal faith. 

So why should I make friends and get into relationships if we all will die alone eventually? Why should I try to use my talents and make a career/something out of my life if we all will return to dust?

Right now, I have to literally force myself to do anything for my PhD. Reading an e-mail, reading a chapter in a book feels like forcing oneself to puke. Like it's possible, but it's physically unpleasant. 

At these times, I really envy religious people, especially those born again Christians. 

tl;dr: So basically I got to a point in life where nothing is worth my time: Neither friendships, neither relationships, neither career. As long as I'd be able to somehow survive (i.e. somehow make money, eat, sleep, watch YouTube), it's fine, and it can last for the next 75 years until I'm 100. For me, life is just waiting for death. If there is no afterlife, nothing is worth the investment.",1

I have kinda self isolated myself so I’m usually often in my room either sleeping or on my phone. 

I don’t like the environment I’m living in as I have terrible parents and siblings and bad memories stuck to that environment but I don’t have the ability to leave because I don’t have a stable job or any savings or anywhere to go to. 

I dread waking up everyday because unfortunately I’m not ignorant or closed-minded anymore and my existence seems futile. I don’t have any close friends, hobbies, talents, nor a support system which makes it even harder.

It’s all one big hoax to keep me in it. Then I get to thinking that it’s not just my thoughts that I’m hearing, but it’s something influencing them. I also think “If this were true, than how come ___” but then I come back to “What if I’m only thinking that to stay in it.” I have no idea how to cope with these feelings. I’ve tried therapy for different reasons, and while it did help get out my emotions it didn’t give me much comfort in the fact that it will be like this until I die. There is no more I can see than what is in front of me, and I have to accept that.

1702709340.0,An Optical Illusion of the Soul,"What if no one truly knows where the wind blows. What if we fabricate our reality. What if we are dreaming. What if I am the main character, and no matter how conscientious everyone else seems to be, it is truly all a fictitious act.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An Optical Illusion for the Soul

What do we trust?

Our senses can be deceived. Optical illusions shatter what we put our faith in oh so dearly. Sounds can be skewed to sound like different words. Intentions can be misidentified and warped with our natural human lenses. 

Is the soul the final space? Is the spirit within us the rock that everything is based upon? 

Why does nobody ask the question “What’s above the soul?”. Why have I never heard that question asked?

There is debate of beginning and end, but no debate of depth. Our senses seem fickle—in fact scientifically *every one of our senses transmits data that has already happened in the past by the time it gets converted in our brain.* Even just for a millionth of a second, it has technically occurred in the past already.

And we know our senses can be deceived—even in the soberest of people.

So we rely on the spirit to ground.

But is it possible that the spirit can be tricked as well?",1
1702768467.0,The odds are that we’re living in a dead memory,"I just watched a video in which someone was talking how we are in this very moment living in a most likely forgotten memory: Many (mundane) things we do are things we never again think about or can recall, what you’re now doing is probably one of that! Everything we are currently doing is from this perspective just a mental phenomenon even though it is right now a real subjective experience. This is fascinating because one reason for things we think or do alone (or even with people since we can apply this idea to their situation as well) demonstrably existing is our experience and memory of it.
At the same time what we remember is so biased, flawed and edited through repetitive recall that it’s almost a totally different thing. Is/will our experience then just be non-existing or a mental phenomenon? Of course you can also argue that our experience is/creates something that allocates space and time which therefore exists and will exist regardless of our view of it. I’m not trying to make a philosophical argument here but i’m interested in hearing concepts relating to this and your take on it.

Edit: Putting it differently: Memories and momentary experience are of course very different things conceptually. Momentary experience is a subjective feeling that is however from any other point in the timeline something inaccessible, something forgotten. We have a single current moment but we have had innumerable moments that were forgotten, and looking *from any other point in time* our current moment is one of those forgotten moments.",1

1702610486.0,Realization of my own meanings and the responsibilities to keep it.,"I'm familiar with existentialism philosophy, though not an expert, I read some works from Nietzsche and Walter Kaufmann's existentialism anthology (stopped at Jaspers because I had a hard time understanding him). Also pardon me for my poor English if you notice a mistake. I'm not a native English speaker and I only use English in text, not in speaking.


[How I arrived here:]

Since primary school (I think I was 7-9 yrs old at that time), I had these obscure thoughts alienating myself from the world around me. 

I asked myself questions like: ""Why do I see the world in first person?"", ""How do other peope view the world?"", ""Why my viewpoint of the world is limited by my body?"" and then ""Who really am I?""

At some point, I began looking at things weirdly. I noticed that the more I look at something, the more it becomes alien to me. What was once familiar, is becoming something that genuinely scares me. The feeling of the unknown and being insignificant to it.

All of this thoughts was stopped by my First Catholic communion. Heavily indoctrinated, my mind was occupied with god related things onwards.

Fast forward, now an agnostic 19yrs old (I wholeheartedly thanks Nietzsche for that), after comprehending some existentialism philosophy, I began to assess what's truly meaningful to me and what should I do to take responsibility for it.

[Realization of my own meanings and the responsibilities to keep it.]

I will make this short since It's impossible write all of my meanings here.

…

1 month ago, I walked early in the morning. While slowy walking across the streets, I appreciated the warm sunlight and the mundane serenity of the streets. It gave me simple happiness. 

And then came the realization: ""So this too is part of my meaning..."" but then, suddenly asked myself: ""Is happiness really that easy?""

After asking those questions to myself, I realized a problem. I have no full control of my own meanings. Why? It's because I'm afraid to wake up early everytime in the morning! 

Yes, I'm not talking responsibility for my newly realized meaning! It's still my meaning but it will only exist in my memories unless experienced again. Maybe accepting that I have no full control of my own meanings is taking responsibility?

1702533547.0,this strange little planet in the middle of nowhere is generating conscious experiences,"So I have no idea if this is existentialist or not. Reddit keeps pushing this sub in my feed. Hello everyone.

I can't stop thinking about this. Everything we experience - indeed, experience itself - seems to be completely anomalous in the universe. We are little pieces of the crust of this planet, temporarily animated by a runaway evolutionary process. This strange little world just grew us on accident. Nothing about this is usual.

The universe doesn't know we are here. It doesn't understand anyone is looking at it. We are its voyeurs.

I think a lot about our five senses. You never really experience *people*. Your own soul or the souls of your friends or family. Everything you see, hear, feel, taste or smell is a piece universe. Even your inner monologue, your emotions and impulses, follow pretty clearly from your animal structure, pounded into this shape by millions of years of evolution. Our consciousness was never a clean slate; it has always been a very idiosyncratic thing, peculiar to this environment and the kind of creatures we happen to be.

I think as individuals we only barely exist. We are little sparks of animal intelligence, firing off in the darkness and then gone in a flash. What we have discovered - and this I think is incredibly profound - is that *this* exists. This vast place. We may be the first to realize this. At least the first within earshot.

There is no natural order. There is no way any of this is *supposed* to go. None of it is planned.

And that is just incredibly startling.",1

1702511768.0,Started having death anxiety after starting to enjoy life,"For a long time I have accepted death, even welcomed it. The thought that you didn't experience before birth, so things will just go back to what was before, was enough for me to cope. 
Now I think all of this was the case because I was depressed and even suicidal at times for a long time of my life (10+ years)
Now I am in my late 20s and have finally had a lot of experiences which people usually go through earlier in life and my life is finally unstuck and progressing, I am getting absolutely terrified of death.

I get these periods where I become hyperaware of my consciousness and fleeting existence and I cannot cope with it. The more I think about it the more primitive I see myself: a bunch of molecules which simply respond to stimuli producing thought, some of it becoming more fixed and habitual forging an identity to deal with it's own awareness.
Just a fleeting process, one piece of a puzzle formed by the laws of physics and elements of the universe.

I have long lost the hope for any answers, as there are none. I can't even form definite opinions on most things, I strongly believed I should figure out some topics before I could fully live. My family and I strongly disagree on some things and I just don't give a fuck anymore. I don't try to argue or put much effort into figuring out answers, as it seems quite pointless. I don't have much time and I think it would be more productive to spend it on other things. Now I just believe I should strongly figure out how to best do certain mundane things, so I can best teach my future child.

If all goes well I am nearly 1/3d through life and it is only going to get faster. It is really incredibly short and I know that all that is important is right now and I am enjoying it, even seeing the process as the important thing instead of just the eventual results, like graduating and stuff like that.

But I have so much anxiety thinking about how short it is and... Meaningless in the end. Like I have a partner now who I know I want to be with until death, but in my mind it is already nearly there when I think about it and it keeps me up at night. It's even harder to think about how my dad also has death anxiety and he is much closer to death than I am, he even had a near death experience once before.
I don't know what to do and I guess I'm looking for some comradery or some helpful ways to think about things.

Like the modern world has probably lower crimes and more ways to protect the rights of people than it had in the past. 

But, isn’t the modern way of work and lifestyle is kinda responsible for it in some or the other cases of misery?

Like imagine, physics, math, music, paintings, writing, or take the most forms of arts and sciences: in the earlier generations, it used to be done or is represented in the most genuine and heartfelt and desirable manner. 

Even though there are more researches done than in the past, but most of it is to just consume the work for some kinda profits in terms of consumerism or corporate profits or materialistic satisfaction or some kinda greed. Not everyone, but it is kinda obvious in many instances.

Even till the early 20th century, many people were doing it for the love of subject. But these days, it has become so much about status and profit for any and every research field. Like all the values of loving the subject is gone out of the box.

Like I’ve seen students being shoved with so much of studies without making them understand or comprehend the essence of subjects. They just study go to college get out with good or bad grades and just fall into the trap of corporates that they don’t get the time to even think how and what they’re doing. Even in the very little time they get off of work, the materialistic or the crap of some holistic modern day bullshit takes over their head to escape whatever misery or dread they go through the work.


Like all the advertisements social media s movies and tvs and everywhere it is just constant shoving of things which are so obviously out there to make people paint the miserable word with some shitty delusional crap. 


I don’t know if I’m even making any sense right now, but shit is worse. 
I understand that as the days go by we need to learn more and more to stay competent and sustain in the word, but why has it gone that way? Why has everything just being dragged mercilessly by the materialistic greed profit seeking spineless cowards? 


What in the fucking world of insanity is this even helpful or make a person want to continue?


Just had to get it out of the head. Thanks for reading.

Edit 1: I’m not talking bout every job, I’m talking bout specific roles. I understand that things have gotten better in terms of ethics and right as, which I mentioned in the very beginning. 


Edit 2: After reading through some comments, I guess it also depends on how and what a person has gone through and how life has turned or good or bad given the circumstances. It’s a perspective I guess and an opinion than a fact? Maybe? I don’t know


Edit 3: For people saying that earlier centuries had worst job scenarios than today, as I mentioned earlier I’m talking bout specific jobs and not every job on the planet.
 Please do read the entire thing before trying to raise out or come out with your words or bashing against it. 


TLDR: Although lifestyle and job situation in terms of ethics and morality are now much better than it used to be, specific fields like researches in sciences and art for its pure form seems like they lost their glory due to the societal pressure or some sort of capitalistic profit pressure attached to it.",1

When people ask the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" I always wonder if they understand the question they’re asking. Life is different for everyone, so you wouldn't think there would be one definitive and universal meaning for every single life. Perhaps what they mean to ask is not ""what is the meaning of life?"" but rather ""why is life?"" or ""what are we supposed to be doing?"" People don't ask these questions directly though because they don't like the answers.
	 The answer to ""what are we supposed to be doing?"" has to be decided by every individual on their own.  The answer to ""why are we here?"" is that when the big bang happened some sludge with proteins in it collided with some water and they then mixed together to create some very simplistic form of DNA and that DNA was then read by another type of protein conjunction called RNA and Then RNA was then read itself by another protein jumble called ribosomes. The ribosomes then followed the instructions written on said RNA and created life. 
But this is a tangent. 
Returning to the initial question of what is the meaning of life? To understand this question let's deconstruct the word meaning, meaning is the word we use when we want to say one thing indicates another. For example, the word paraphernalia's meaning is ""objects that are used to do something or tools used for a job or a hobby"".  For instance, a d20 is dnd paraphernalia. Another example of meaning would be the lesson of the fable “The Tortoise and the Hare.” The meaning of said lesson is that: Taking your time to do something well rather than rushing through it will give you a superior result, so the purpose of the story is to give you a lesson and the lesson has a meaning.
You may realize that these two examples of meaning have something in common: they're both made by conscious beings and they both only make sense in the context of a society. Both the word paraphernalia and the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare were authored by people who live in a society and because of that, they were created for other people living in the same society that they were. The word paraphernalia would not mean anything to a species that never developed tools and the story of the tortoise and the hare wouldn't mean anything to people who never try to accomplish things and sit around all day, these things mean something to us because of the context of our society. But even though the creation of life was without context or purpose it's not the case that where we went from there was without meaning because once consciousness was brought into the picture then meaning could be imposed onto existence.

1702434717.0,"Irrational Man, A Study in Existential Philosophy - William Barrett","I was really impressed by a recent rereading of William Barrett's *Irrational Man*. We need to be reminded that there are many constructs and institutions that only exist to dehumanize us and dismiss our experience of Being as illusion or wishful thinking. His thesis is just as powerful and relevant today as in the 1950s:

""Existentialism is the counter-Enlightenment come at last to philosophic expression; and it demonstrates beyond anything else that the ideology of the Enlightenment is thin, abstract, and therefore dangerous. (I say its ""ideology,"" for the practical task of the Enlightenment is still with us: In everyday life we must continue to be critics of a social order that is still based everywhere on oppression, injustice, and even savagery—such being the peculiar tension of mind that we as responsible human beings have to maintain today.) The finitude of man, as established by Heidegger, is perhaps the death blow to the ideology of the Enlightenment, for to recognize this finitude is to acknowledge that man will always exist in untruth as well as truth. Utopians who still look forward to a future when all shadows will be dispersed and mankind will dwell in a resplendent Crystal Palace will find this recognition disheartening. But on second thought , it may not be such a bad thing to free ourselves once and for all from the worship of the idol of progress; for utopianism—whether the brand of Marx or of Nietzsche—by locating the meaning of man in the future leaves human beings here and now, as well as all mankind up to this point, without their own meaning. If man is to be given meaning the Existentialists have shown us, it must be here and now; and to think this insight through is to recast the whole tradition of Western thought. The realization that all human truth must not only shine against an enveloping darkness, but that such truth is even shot through with its own darkness may be depressing, and not only to utopians. But it has the virtue of restoring to man his sense of the primal mystery surrounding all things, a sense of mystery from which the glittering world of his technology estranges him, but without which he is not truly human.""

When the Existentialists were first crawling out of the rubble of our world wars, it couldn't have been more clear that the legacy of the Enlightenment was a vast apparatus of exploitation, control, slaughter and domination. What that means is that the abstract, artificial Reason that rationalized slaughter and domination is as far from the truths of human experience as you can get. If you're still committed to the Dream of Reason and the nostalgia for progress, I have no idea what appeals to you about the Existentialists.

The darkness that Barrett is talking about here isn't the epistemic horizon that is constantly being pushed back by scientific progress. It's something in humans and human society that can't be rationally understood, the core of Being. Society has constructed unwieldy control systems like religion and science to try to either make it useful or explain it away, but it's an abiding problem for humanity: what does human existence mean? The Existentialists say that the first step toward answering this isn't studying Scripture or mapping the human genome, it's the individual living authentically.

The Enlightenment program led to the Industrial Revolution and the juggernaut of colonialism and exploitation that went along with it. The Holocaust was a grotesque demonstration of the horrors of technological efficiency; the shadows on the Hiroshima walls were the result of the way the Reason Machine looked at ineffable human experience as irrelevant next to the glories of scientific progress.

The existentialists weren't fond of rose-colored glasses.

But Nietzsche takes this a step further, his idea is that the universe is structured in such a way that everything about it, and everything in it expresses a will to power.

He uses the idea of an elemental organism that keeps eating and eating until it can no longer sustain its own size.

1702270961.0,I had a wake up call,"I just want to talk about my experience sorry English is not my first language.

Basically when I was a kid I remember waking up the first time and asking my self who am I, I didn’t know my family like if they were strangers. Since little I feel presence and I’m able to feel people’s energy and I’m really good at identifying patterns. Since kid I try seeking for answers of why I feel those presence because I started having sleep paralysis, I took anti psychotic pills and all sort of medication and it never went away until an old friend of mine the use to tell me that she use to feel energy and said the my energy was super strong, she told me about meditation and something weird happen when I try it the first time,I got up from the position I was meditating and began going outside. I saw a guy holding what it looks like a sword and he was glowing like a white/yellow color. We started speaking in another language And I was able to understand than I went into a vortex and wake up in a sleep paralysis, once I was out of the sleep paralysis I want to go back meditating because I was curious what just happen, than when I started meditating I open my eyes and there was bunny and bird going all over me in the bed, and than I saw a women what it looks like a trumpet and started speaking to me in the language. when we finish talking she put a finger in my head and I went to a vortex again, and when I wake up I was again in the sleep paralysis but this time I was able to move the first thing the went to my head was punching the “demon” and he did a little noise and went to the closet. When I open my eyes I found the door open and I check the cameras and I check the footage of when I was meditating and it was green, I wasn’t able to see what happen but since I guess I’ve been waking up and now. My life took a turn that I have never thought would happen. I still feel the presence but I understand now that is just I can feel my energy. btw I try suicide 5 times and every time I feel pain in the heart I fall of sleep and wake up the next day like nothing happen, like if I didn’t took a entire bottle of buspirone

1702219068.0,"Why are so many people saying nothing is real, it is all you (solipsism)?","Hello, I am currently struggling with existential questions and my focus is oftentimes on solipsism. The idea that I am the only conscious perspective that exists. That other people might be there as appearances but not as conscious perspectives like I am. I want to clarify that I am not a solipsist. I don't believe it. I am just scared of it. A lot.

Whenever I dig into existential questions about free will, existence, consciousness, why everything is the way it is etc. I always end up seeing comments like ""They are all you. It is all you. Only you"". Or things like ""You are the only thing that exists. Everything else is your imagination."" Oftentimes upvoted multiple times.

This freaks me out because I don't understand why people would say that. The only reason I would ever say something like this is to gaslight or troll someone. For no other reason. And it is hard for me to believe that all the people I see writing this are doing this with malicious intentions. Because they are not saying it from their perspective ""I am all that exists."" They are saying it about me.

To me this is unexplainable. And it scares me because it seems like a nightmare where my imagination is telling me to wake up. Why would anyone ever claim that they themselves do not exist to tell me that I am everything? Does anyone have an explanation?

I may be very well just driving myself insane but what leads me to this question is how every day follows the same dynamic of we wake up, eat, socialize, follow our individual routines, every now and then a major event or news happen in our society but nothing to the scale I mentioned.

At the same time the more I think about it, I realize this concept of “ordinary” only exists in my own illusion of reality because I exist in this very moment as a conscious being in an incomprehensible universe which quite literally not a single one of us knows exactly why or what’s going on. Any way I look at it whether the explanation of existence comes through religion or science in the end it does not give a satisfactory answer to the question of reality.

Following popular Abrahamic religions the explanation is that there is one God who created us and don’t get me wrong I definitely believe in a higher power, it just doesn’t make sense to me to believe we are simply here by chance as some non-religious people believe. Now if we take a different approach and look at the also popular Big Bang theory at some point in time the atoms and elements became conscious? And I love science because it tries to explain and understand how our universe works but I often find people grow arrogant and believe these theories to be the definitive “truth” but true scholars are aware of the incredible amount of things we do not know. These are all axioms created by us humans.

Couldnt cry,
Fear of myself looking on the mirror,
Feeling that i lost myself when i watched my old photos,
Not recognizing family members and wife (that was the worst thing),
Waking up one day and realizing that u wont recognize anyone in the world not even urself.


Everything listed here were my symptoms. Went to my psychologist and she told me that ur in a somatic moment.
My cardiologist told me ur heart is totally fine,
My ophtamologist told me that yout vision is clear and u have no problems,
My neurologist told me that theres nothing wrong with u.

every symptom that I had now they all are gone, Or even if i feel soemthing its only the shaky hands or feets sometimes its a heat flush that I get or sometimes my stomach feels like having butterflies. I started feeling joy and happiness started gettning better, i can now talk to strangers, i can be myself, i can eat whatever i want and i feel myself grounded hopefully but there's something still haning out with me.

The FEAR OF BEING IN A DREAM or should i say False awakening, it happened a month ago and I was thinking that I wake up and i sit on my PC but no, i was in my bed and I went nuts and the anxiety just locked my entire body, and the second time it happened was when i was woth my psychologist and out of nowehere while she was talking my mind just told me ""wait ur in a dream"" and I just locked and felt so bad and forgot like everything i talked with my psychologisit, she told me yes it happens because u just were constantly mentioning and it came :) but I was ok after but when that happens my happines just goes down and I feel depressed after. Sometimes while doing something my brain tries to recall every fucking thing like what happened 10 sec ago and I try to recall it and that makes me sick because I know not everything should be remembered like that, otherwise i remember things clearly from the past and have no problems about it not even today but sometimes recalling something or trying to remember anything related to a task was a struggle cuz I couldnt remember anything what someone said before, it made me feel that I am stupid ina  way and my IQ went down or someshit that was the biggest fear.

I have no one in my family that has/had any schizophrenia, dementia or anything else.

I Think im on my way recovering like 80% maybe even 90% but Im afraid of being happy now because I sense that the feeling of being in a dream will destroy my happiness again and again :(.

I live a happy life, i work a lot but now my doctors told me to reduce stress cuz thats the main reason of feeling like this. And i reduced work in the matter that IM working but not gicing stress to myself like omg why i didnt finish this thing.

I would like to know ur stories about this, and I would really appreciate everyeones time on this. Im feeling better im totally betetr than i was in the 1 month ago even better a week ago.

I think I still fear from what I experienced and its all in my mind but im trying to get out of this :)

I pray for everyone of u and It will go away trust me I had so many symptoms that I didnt even know what to do but here I am now.

1701928907.0,How do I choose the meaning of my life? How do I live the best life? [Intractability],"Sure, life has no inherent meaning. Sure, we give our life meaning by choosing what we want our life to be about, and there are certain well known heuristics, e.g. [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/COOX6mecXW)

This is misdirection. The human brain is a simple optimizer that demands model to optimize, and the actual question people are asking is ""how do I live a well-lived life?"" ""What model of life can I find so that things start to make sense and I can move ahead?"" 

You may say, well, existentially, there is no solution. That's not true. At some point, someone may be able to weigh their life and say ""I figured out how to live my life and it went just about as well as I could ask. I didn't mess up any key decisions.""

In any event it doesn't much matter, you are required to make decisions.

It's like chess, a general perfect decision making model of chess is impossible, but if you won chess it's easy to check.

You may then say ""well, just like chess, making a perfect model is impossible."" Sure, but imperfect models aren't impossible, and in fact we do it for chess. The way we approach life is very similar to how we build decision making models for chess.

1) in the short term, we step things ahead a few moves and see if we get to a better position
2) for the long term, we make moves based on guesses and ""feelings,"" and you may say 'no it's not a feeling' and I would say, yes it is. AlphaZero is a model-free approach which means it has no idea what is going on, it just feels like it's closer to a victory state.

You may say, 'well we make decisions every day, what's the problem?'

I'll give some examples from my life:

""I have a PhD, but many other PhDs end up unhappy in cubicles. Should I be a creative? Do I want to try and start my own company? What if I work 80 hours a week and make millions, would that be good? Billionaires seem to like it. Is Elon Musk happy? What if the right answer is just to raise kids and it doesn't matter? What mindset should I have here?""

""I have a fun but kind of messed up love interest. Do I turn it down because I can most likely find someone I'll like more? How does that make sense though, perpetually searching for a perfect partner, shouldn't I just make the best with what I have and move forward? What mindset should I have here?""

""Should I cure cancer, join the government, get my name in textbooks or what? What mindset should I have here?""

""Does morality actually matter or is it just the frontal lobe sweet-talking our limbic system? What mindset should I have here?""

I don't know if I am really conveying the idea. These questions are dependent on my understanding of the purpose of my life. Despite this, life is beyond the ability to start to solve the slightest sense of it, it is unsolvable or 'intractable.' More to the point, the goal of life is itself intractable. For a decade I have wished I could clone myself at every key decision and take both paths, but I am alone at every doorway.

Is this where everyone ends up? Is there nothing but broken and poorly applicable heuristics to jam into my life, fully aware that they are no closer to the truth than anything else? I'm legitimately, not rhetorically asking, because as I see it, the following path is inevitable:

(1) There is no purpose because there is no real meaning in life.

(2) You automatically act according to some facade of a real purpose based on a heuristic

(3) The heuristic is incomplete, and either screws you (hedonism is fun until your partner leaves you for cheating) or can't be applied well (ok cool I want to be known throughout time for my works, how do I get started?) and you realize you need to adjust your heuristics closer to the truth

(4) you attempt to understand the nature of your life, and are unable to grasp major aspects of critical pieces

(5) you convince yourself you've gained some insight and adjust your decision-making heuristic

(6) you repeat 2-5 until 7

(7) you give up and convince yourself you made it, in a fate similar to Winston at the end of 1984. You put on some tinted glasses that convince you that the void is colored a lovely shade of some ideology, say singulitarian. You begin trying to help immortality research. You laugh at people who have different colored glasses on.

Conclusion and TL;Dr: Is there no way to make decisions in your life besides complicated forms of pure guessing? On the microscopic level, it seems easy. In any other perspective, it seems impossible (intractable) to even make progress, unless you lie to yourself to simply things incorrectly",1

1701892597.0,Losing My Mind Over Many Worlds Theory. Is there any way out?,"Hello everyone,

Posted this in [r/AskPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/) and [r/QuantumPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumPhysics/). They told me that this is more of a philosophical than a physical question. So I post it here now.

I  am going crazy because of Quantum Physics. According to my limited  understanding of quantum mechanics there are theories out there that  state that in our ""reality"" every possible branch that could exist  actually exists. Of course this is meant on a particle level but with  enough branching it would also translate into our daily life.

If  that is true, would that not mean that there is absolutely no reality  to anything? My girlfriend or mother have no character. I just happen to  be in a universe or reality where they behave in a certain way. They  are not actually in any way. There is an infinite number of realities  where they are slightly different or completely different. Nothing at  all is in any sense ""real"". It is just a version that I happen to land  in. Same goes for myself. I am just whatever randomly happens. Why would  I even care about anything then? Why would I try to help people? Why  achieve anything? There are realities in which it happens and those in  which it doesn't. Also, there are realities in which people are tortured  in eternity.

What's scaring me even more is communities like [r/NevilleGoddard](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/),  where people use this ""knowledge"" to shift realities based on their  desires. They have this idea of EIYPO (everything is you pushed out) and  that our assumptions about reality cause us to jump between the  possibilities of the wave function. Meaning that when I deeply assume a  behavior of my girlfriend, mother, friend etc. I will end up in a branch  where this actually happens. And if that is true, who are other people  even? Are they even conscious entities or am I just jumping as the only  solipsistic perspective between branches.I know this probably sounds  stupid to you. But this is freaking me out. I am in therapy already  because of this. It is horrible. I don't need any definitive proof  against it (as I know it probably does not exist). But do you have any  insight into this, that can put this into perspective? Is the theory  stupid? Is my interpretation wrong? Is it correct but I am viewing it  from a bad angle?

TL;DR: The idea  that everything that can exist does exist, causes me intense feelings of  panic and terror. I don't see any point in living if no action makes a  difference, since all outcomes exist anyways. And very very horrible  realities (eternal torture) also exist. Is there a way to escape this  perspective?",1

1701915442.0,Free Will,"Can someone explain to me why they think there is free will? I barely see anything logical about it.

Let's start off by examining how free will would work. In my opinion, free will would operate in a world where the future is completely unknown, which our future isn't, due to the butterfly effect. We all know that we can calculate and predict things, and the precision is determined by the amount of information we have. Imagine there is a hypothetical being that freezes time and possesses all of the information in the universe – and by all of it, I mean completely all of it. The being can calculate everything and anything into the future, leaving our future at a 100% chance of happening in a certain way. It's important because if there is only one outcome possible for the whole universe, then an individual doesn't have free will.

I believe our world is made up of massive interconnected energy/ies. I got this from Tesla's numbers theory and the apple in the sealed box theory. What's in the box will go through every single possible way the energy there can change places and transform, etc. Basically, that is our universe in a big never-ending box with energy interchanging possibly forever. Essentially, the energy is like numbers – 1+1=2 – and you get something different from adding one thing. Our universe can expand and interchange from how many 1s there are before going back to the starting state, as in the apple in the box theory. That only can't happen if there is an infinite amount of energy, for it would be changing forever forward.

We're basically the same as everything but also different. Like us, the tiny portion of our universe doesn't have free will like we think. It's just a construct; it isn't really real. Instead, there is a process of thought that happens from the will of the interconnected energy. It is funny how one piece of the universe can look at another and think it's, for example, dumb.

The only way I see there being free will is if somebody is controlling our bodies without us or our bodies knowing it. But it doesn't make sense because then it would still mean that, in this world, there is no free will, and our minds operate in this world.

I can't think of one logical way for there to be free will that doesn't require a massive leap of faith. Can anyone inspire me?",1
1701870726.0,A thought experiment for y'all,"***First part***

Imagine that in - let's say - 30 years from now, our capitalistic society gets so individualistic to the extent it cannot function properly anymore. Or maybe there is a big natural disaster that destroys the societal structures as we know them today and we need to build everything from scratch again.

A tech company allies with the state in order to implant little ""compassion chips"" in our brains, which make us more empathetic and altruistic towards others. They are only meant for utilitarian reasons.

Here's how the compassion chip works: every time you do a good action, you get a big rush of dopamine/endorphins. You start to associate being a good person with pleasure ; in other words, you become addicted to doing good things. It doesn't mean that you feel the urge to do it because it feels morally right, but because **you** ***become*** **addicted to the feeling of euphoria/pleasure it gives you**.

**Would these people still be considered moral, even if they do the right thing (e.g. saving someone from drowning) only because it gives them a rush of pleasure?**

***Second part***

Now, imagine you were one of those people whose brain chemistry has been altered by a ""compassion chip"": one day, you wake up and realize that the functioning of the chip has been **reversed** (we don't know whether it's an error or whether someone changed it intentionally). You realize that you can only feel a rush of dopamine/endorphins by hurting others and doing morally reprehensible things. Not only that, but it even physically hurts to be a good person. It feels like pure hell. Imagine the worst kind of pain you could inflict on another human being without killing him - and that's it.

The more significant your help is, the more severe your pain becomes (e.g. saving a child from drowning is much more painful than just holding the door for an old lady, for instance).

**How much time will you manage to remain a good person in these conditions? Do you think you could continue doing the ""right"" thing while constantly being severely punished for it by your internal brain chemistry?**

1701812809.0,I don’t know what to believe anymore,"I just want some like minded folks to talk about this with.

Lately, life events have just made me question everything. The more people I talk to, and the more perspectives I learn and understand, the less I feel like there’s any fundamental truth to anything. And the more I learn about philosophy to try and make sense of things, the more I feel like ultimately nothing makes sense.

It’s hard to even articulate how deep it goes in my head. 

I’d describe myself as being somewhat of a spiritual person. But lately it feels harder to believe in that. I’ve met so many people who told me their struggles and experiences with immense suffering. The senseless type of suffering, such as spouses and innocent children dying of cancer. The occurrence of these things alone makes me think that there can’t be a fundamental goal or higher power in the universe, lest the fundamental power be largely indifferent to human suffering. I also find it hard to believe that all suffering happens for an ultimate ‘purpose’ set by the universe. Otherwise we’d be able to somehow quantify what that purpose is. A lot of the world’s suffering honestly just feels senseless. 

This has also led me down the path of questioning other things such as ethics, morals, right and wrong, etc.. And the more I think about these principles, the more I feel like they don’t objectively exist. We make them all up, and basically govern by popular majority of belief. 

Like morals for example. A lot of moral issues have no clear right or wrong. Hot button political topics are notorious for this. The more I learn about either side of any debate, the more it becomes clear that there just isn’t a morally correct answer. Sure I can pick a side on these things, which I naturally do, but I also recognize that my opinion is largely based on my own limited perspective and is far from being the ultimate morally correct opinion. 

This applies to any framework which we humans collectively attempt to agree on. Like what is a good person? What is a bad person? I used to think an objective truth to that fundamentally existed. But it just doesn’t.

I feel like I’m coming to the conclusion that when you break anything down to its root essence, everything in existence ‘just is’. Sometimes the majority agrees on what is true, but it doesn’t make that thing actually true. Everything just is, and any meaning we assign to something is made up. 

We construct everything to have a meaning so that we can operate in accordance to that meaning. But all roads lead back to the meaning we give things being entirely made up for the purpose of our own survival. 

I feel like I no longer can say which worldviews/ideas/opinions are morally correct.  I feel like I can no longer say which conclusions are most truthful. All I can do is state that which resonates most with my perspective.

How can an objective ethical truth exist if right and wrong is not a fundamental  framework of reality? That is to say, if the universe itself does not abide by ethical principles, then we have no basis to determine any fundamental truth. Any and  all conclusions are constructed by our collective agreements and disagreements. 

At this point, I can’t help but confront the fact that anything I choose to do in this life ultimately doesn’t have a purpose other than the one I give to it, and I recognize that any purpose I choose to give to it is ultimately made up. 

Nothing makes sense, nothing we do means anything, and nothing we place a moral/ethical value on is fundamentally correct. Even to state that nothing is objectively true is a paradox, since that itself now becomes a fundamental truth. To state that nothing is objectively true is to state that nothing being objectively true is in itself an objective truth. Like it just doesn’t make sense. No conception of our existence makes sense.

I’m just curious if anybody else has come to a similar conclusion. I don’t really know what to think anymore, and I can’t make any sense of our existence.",1
1701807374.0,Bruh whaaaaat?,"So, I saw a reel on instagram where a mother is grieving her son, like 2-3yrs old toddler. And it made be think about how pointless life is. The longer you live, the more you grief. All the people you ever loved will die one by one. Who wants that??
And if you die young, then what’s the point of being here in the first place??
And the fact that we humans keep reproducing even though we know how shitty the world is? Like, there is pedophiles, rapists, murderers out there and there is no guarantee that your child will never run into them. And it’s not like you can keep your kid locked up in your home for safety. You have to let them go.
Life is a meaningless prison and the only way out is death. And nobody is 100% sure what happens after it. Some are a bit more delusional with the whole heaven and hell stuff, but that’s faith and there is like 0 evidence.
And the fact that we are all going to die??? I mean I don’t want to live for eternity but I sure as heck don’t want to experience the process of dying!

Lets look at this from the basics. First of all, I know I exist. Like Descartes said, ""I think, therefore I am."" But how do I know that others exist? What if everyone is just a figment of my imagination?   


Well, we don't know anything, for one. I could be secretly Kanye West under my skin and you wouldnt know unless you skinned me. Which you won't do, because what if I'm not actually Kanye under my skin and I just lied? The same applies to solipsism. You're not gonna run into a grocery store naked and screaming, because what if solipsism isnt true and everyone is just as real as you are? There you go, you don't actually believe in solipsism. That's a good thing to get out of the way first.  


Second, if I'm truly the only person and I created this existence for myself, why am I not a billionaire with gold cars and toilets and women at my service 24/7? Why would I give myself such a boring, basic life where I'm purely just unknown and random to the world? And why can I not control reality, like why can't I just make my crush like me or destroy that building with my mind? If I truly created this world for myself, it doesn't make sense for me to have given myself such a basic and pathetic life. And someone might argue that another God placed me here with fake people, well that alone debunks solipsism because therefore I am not truly alone.  


Third, why do I have such limited understanding of the world? I still don't understand 9th grade algebra. I still dont understand the creation of the universe. I still dont understand conciousness. And theres plenty of smaller things I don't understand, like how touch screens work or how recording works. If I created all of those things, then I think I would be at least somewhat capable of understanding it. But i'm not. And if I was truly some almighty creator who placed myself in a normal life, then I would understand it.  


Fourth, I can make an idea, and then give it to others, and that idea can be improved. That also proves that theres something or someone participating in this reality with me that is capable of improving my ideas. And I can also ask someone to feed me random numbers, and that also proves that people are somewhat capable of thinking things on their own. If you guessed their numbers before they said them, then it would be more plausible. Same thing also goes for math problems, if someone stumps you with a math problem they gave you then they are capable of thinking, and therefore, they are.  


I'll try my best to disprove any arguing comments. This is all the best arguments i've come up with. For any solipsists i hope you get through it soon.",1

1701783615.0,"The Son of Man; February 5, 2022","Why don't I commit suicide? A question that keeps echoing and protesting on my doorsteps. I start my day with an anxiety of an incomplete mind. I do things that I don't know what they're, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, illusion from reality. It's difficult for the mind of this being to comprehend the self and the whole; no, the self and the other—is there an all after all?

Myself mocks me, creates distance between me and my states. What drives me is the barbaric that my species loves to adorn—that energy of life, the will to exist and actualize. The enchantment of triumph that pervades every movement, though we're rarely aware of it. I long for my people, but am I really yearning for my people, or do I miss myself? The echoes  within the realm of my mind don't answer. Did I really have that soul to begin with, or, with some stories, do I molly-coddle myself?

In a darkness of a dictatorial boundary of the self, I find myself thinking in random aimlessness. It begins and ends with me. This is a ruin of a self that toys itself with its outer walls.

And I always ask about the meaningfulness as If the the word has a meaning. Strange letters that have the power to stop my futility, but absurdity is a transcendental entity telling us that there's nothing truly transcendental.

Among words, there are those whose necks have been twisted till they no longer mean anything: will, power, desire, sex, potency, actualization. Isn't language a functional illusion that we live inside and that lives and becomes real with us? But, no, what about this sentence?

If you do, you live. If you stop, you die. Every stop is a medieval woman, except that she's the type who chases death—that lord, that noble of darkness.

The desire to kll the pen and extinguish this paper fire haunts me. It's a fire destined to be extinguished if the pen dies, the arena is destroyed, or if the poem commits suicide and is forgotten. I realize now that this seat itself doesn't leave the description of random aimlessness that I don't know what it's.

Every ""I"" is alone, even if she showed compassion to herself with statues of what's outside. Even if she called them neighbors, even if she wrote about them threats or the idolization of the beloved. Love is an idol worship of what cannot be known. To love is to have power over you. To be loved is to have authority and potency over someone; desire, competition, and revenge. What a power of adornment to what the person has of fear, loneliness, and desire for concealment! We mask it in a product that we shop for in miserable madness. And then there it is, the grand celebration of the celestial; this meaning of life. I apologize, Schopenhauer. The good is not an illusion, but it cannot be relied upon.

I ask about the pronoun ""we"", and I find no answer or thought except for ""I ask about the pronoun 'we' "".

Do as you please of wounds bandages and music. This species has no hope. But before that, does this species even put a positive value to this claimed hope? And really, Is this desired really desirable? Is it really goodness? Thieves of the word goodness are everywhere and every domain.

And why goodness, in any case? Why not evil? And why the two to begin with? I propose a new religion in which we crusify who invented the two, and then we demand from those who used them to ask for forgiveness, and after that, we crusify who invented the word contradiction.

All that is real is this existent becoming. If we crusify the truth, does it remain true? From the misery of the ego to the misery of matter. What's wrong with illusion anyway?

Love is an adornment of a transcendental appearance and a beautiful social mask for what lies within the essence of sex, which is conflict, violence, and power.

I am uniquely conscious of my life as each person is uniquely conscious of their life.

The question that then arises for me is why is it the case that in all of time, I became conscious personally of this life, with this brain, in this body?  Why not someone in the past or the future or not at all.

Let’s put aside religious views and ideas of soul for a moment.  How do we comprehend the existence of an individual’s unique consciousness and identity.  Yes, we can say that the brain is the source for all senses and consciousness.  But how does that explain why I am actively conscious for this life, body, time and you are separately conscious for your life, body time (and so on and so forth).  Why do *I think, therefore I am*.

In trying to better comprehend this individual person-specific consciousness and identity a second question arises.  Why would it not be possible or conceivable that at some time in the past or future “you” or “me” was, or will be, actively conscious of another body, life, time?  Why am I the conscious thinker of this personal existence?  Why do I think, therefore I am.  And is it possible that at some point in the past or future another being existed or will exist to which I (whatever “I” is) will be the active conscious observer.

If time and the universe are infinite (which are debatable), I would suppose that it would be more likely for multiple conscious experiences.  In my view, this can be the case even if there is no continuity of a unique individual consciousness.  Instead the role of the observer can be achieved multiple times by whatever anatomical characteristics form an individual consciousness.  Whatever those fundamental characteristics are - like how do you resolve that identical twins do not share a consciousness but rather each have a separate, unique individual consciousness observing their life.

Alternatively, one could argue for the theories of a continual consciousness that survives bodily death or a universal consciousness whereby we are all just the means by which the universe observes and experiences itself.  

It all still makes me wonder why me, why now, why this life, as this current observer instead of never being an observer or being the observer at any other time and as any other person.",1
1701695837.0,"Being part of something larger just shifts the problem one step further away, it doesn't solve it.","For many years I had no existential angst or fear of death. I found great joy and  meaning in being a parent as well as belonging to communities and causes larger than myself. This made me feel at ease with death as I knew that these communities and causes would continue beyond my death. And all these endeavours felt so meaningful.

But then it suddenly struck me that this ""belonging to something bigger"" just shifted the ""problem"" of impermanence one (or several) step away from myself. I had this truly brutal epiphany that nothing lasts. Everyone and everything we love will perish one day. Maybe even existance itself as we know it (altough no one can say with any degree of certainty if that is actually the case, despite theories of heat death and similar concepts).

My epiphany caused me great distress. I no longer felt the joy and satisfaction of raising children, working for causes I believe in and just generally trying to be the best version of myself. Psycologically, I used to be one of those people who took great joy in living life in a general pursuit of optimization: optimize your health, optimize your nutrition, optimize your parenting, optimize your training... etc. Suddenly all that just felt like exercises in vanity.

My first reaction to this epiphany was that I wanted to go back, to simply forget this ""insight"" and pick up my old life again. But now it seems more and more unlikely that this will work. So now I am trying to convince myself that maybe this is part of necessary existential maturing on my behalf (I'm rapidly approaching the age of 40).

I'm trying to make sense of my existence in light of this new ""insight"" I had. I'm trying to meditate on the idea that existance and life itself is a beautiful miracle, and that it is a gift to be alive. But as much as I try, that thought is not enough to make me happy or feel satisfied. In fact, I have no idea what it would take to make me happy again. Which sets off an entire chain of thoughts in itself: ""Oh, so is that the meaning of life? That you should be happy? Why?"". In other words, the more I contemplate this issue, the more confusion it seems to bring.

What I do know for a fact is that I do not wish to suffer. And that is enough to provide me with a foundation for my quest in search for meaning. Because if I could find a sense of meaning again, I would no longer suffer.

As for the big question itself, I gravitate more and more towards the idea that the solution lies in exercising the discipline to refrain from thinking about the purpose of existance. To stop questioning if there is any point in pursuing my human desires. To simply be. Because like children are prone to doing, it is easy to keep asking the question ""why?"" into infinity. Furthermore, even talking about a ""solution"" implies there is a question to be asked. It seems to me that no matter how you try to tackle this subject you can not and will never be able to make sense of the meaning of existence or the foundational purpose of anything by means of logical analysis or rational reasoning, deduction etc. I think I should chose to simply accept that I exist and focus more on being and less on meaning. This seems more likely to make for a happy life and even though I can't say that the meaning of life is to be happy I sure know that I WANT to be happy.

It seems to me the more and harder I think about these questions, the more I risk going mad. For example: I find myself even asking what the point is in me feeling a sense of meaning in life. Why is that meaningful? Is it even meaningful? Is the meaning of life dependant on my feelings about it? In the end it seems that this is simply a hole that you can tumble down into that has no bottom as you can always keep questioning even the foundation that your question rests on. In other words: at some point you just have to accept being and stop thinking so hard. And don't ask why.

Has anyone else had similar thoughts to these? How do you handle them?

1701634200.0,I cannot stop being conscious and it makes me panic like nothing else,"I'm basically cursed with this absolutely fucking AGONISING overawareness that I'm ""trapped"" being conscious, like think about it, it's impossible to just simply stop thinking about anything, your mind is always going to be bombarded by thoughts wether you like it or not, and there's literally NO WAY to turn it off or make it stop, even when you sleep you'll be thinking in your dreams, there is absolutely 1000000% no escape from this ever, from my perspective I'm practically ""stuck"" being conscious, and who's to say death is even a escape? I'll more than likely just transform into another form of consciousness since the observer never dies

When I say it makes me panic, I mean panic that makes me pace around my room nonstop for 3 hours straight, or lying in bed completely stiff and too terrified to even move or open my eyes, fighting every fucking urge to guzzle my whiskey to get a moment of peace, at its worst I can't eat, I can't shower, I can hardly get up to go pee, it completely and utterly disables me, all because I fucking realized that I cant stop being conscious, I also have a constant 24/7 wince on my face because I'm so uncomfortable with my own consciousness, it's turned into this very physical sensation of being trapped inside my skull and it's absolutely beyond fucking excruciating

Every day I absolutely fucking despise myself for becoming aware of this knowledge, I've had to stop absolutely everything in life I love because of these debilitating panic attacks:

But the problem is, we believe we have the ability to make decisions when it really seems as though we are compelled to do them from some external source.

Do we really have control in this world? Is this place somewhere we actually have a say in? Are we out of some black mirror shit that seems to never end?

If we die would we have a life outside of this life? Are we energy? Have we already died and is this a life that we are playing black again?

Why does it seem that there is a spiritual essence behind and backing everything that seems to be occurring?

When will science be able to detect life force and soul? And will we know it is the same thing we have been fantasizing about for millennia now? Or will we cling to our old beliefs of the gods of the past?

Perhaps Alzheimer’s is a microcosm of our existence on an eternal scale. Perhaps we are beings on life support suspended in eternity living as though we cannot remember. And we get glimpses of the eternal but never the full view.

Maybe chaos is our mother.

The essence inside of each of us seems to be both unique and the same. The paradox of the double slit experiment rings true as the essence is observed and experienced.

Is there a purpose? 

Is there an end? Is there a reason?

If time doesn’t exist, is there a need to do anything?

There are higher levels of enlightenment. Is there a dimension higher than what I perceive with my faculties.

Is it wise to jump dimensions when I haven’t experienced all of this one?

So I’ve been on this journey for 2 years now and I’ve got all these different realisations regarding life, death, being human, what is beyond human reality, God, and stuff like that. 
I’ve accepted some some different philosophies on these. Mostly I believe, or feel, that I am a part of everything, and that everything is part of nothing and for me that is God. I’ve felt that on *all* of my trips, meditations and day to day life and I do believe that. 
But, and here’s the but, that fucks with me, I sometimes feel that I am nothing more than just atoms and molecules arranged in such an order that this arrangement itself, the brain, is the thing that gives me consciousness. And I don’t see God in that. I want to, but I can’t. 
The feeling that I am nothing more, than just a brain in a human meat bag suit gives me bad leves of depersonalization and derealization, but in the end, that is all true. I am a brain in a meatbag suit. 
How do I accept that? How do I find God in that, if that’s just chemistry, biology and nothing more than that? Is that the point? God being God through human biology, chemistry and everything we are discovering in the world about the world, about us?

God……

From their attempts to persevere, blissfully ignorant that they have gone adrift from what matters in the end: moments.

Nowadays, human are highly educated.

At the same time, people are uncertain about so many things that they don't know what to do.

I’m a complete loser and I want to change my life around. Problem is, is that I don’t know what to fight for. I’m really struggling to find purpose, meaning, and goals to work towards in my life. 

The way I see it, there are 2 pathways in life you can take. 

The first of which is when you live for yourself. That means you pursue what makes you happy and whatever desires you have, examples include: pursuing a great job to make money, putting yourself out there to meet women and form relationships, and travelling around the world to see new places and experiences. Basically, you put yourself and your happiness first.

The second pathway is when you live for your family instead of yourself. This means you pursue a great job to support your family and have a roof over their head, finishing university to make your mother proud, and supporting your cousins in whatever endeavor they undertake. Basically, you put your family first and yourself second.   

I tried and failed at the first pathway, because despite my best efforts I am struggling to find a job, haven’t ever had a girlfriend or women show interest, struggling in university and am really broke. At the age of 25 I’ve missed every great opportunity to form an amazing life with friends and an amazing woman, and have completely given up. 

So I then started to look at the second pathway, I figured if I can’t live for myself and find happiness, then instead I can live for my family and try to make them happy. However, I also failed in this regard too because my family is extremely toxic and dysfunctional, and I don’t think they love me anymore. My father is an abusive alcoholic and my younger sister makes fun of me all the time for being a loser. My mother is amazing, but recently she’s been giving up on me due to my struggles and failures. My family doesn’t love or believe in me anymore. 

So that’s it then really, the pathways in life that I believe one should take are both blocked to me. I can’t live for myself because I’m a loser virgin with no hope, and I can’t live and fight for my family because they don’t love me anymore. So, what do I fight for now?

1701301076.0,romantic relationship thoughts,"Hi everyone

I hesitated to write here but I feel the need to share my views on relationship and confront my ideas through rational prism.I've always been single and mostly rejecting romantic love and couple. I'm a man of 27 yo. This rejection has extended to love in all forms, including family and friends, even though it didn't last as I got into very dark mental places.

I will focus below on romantic love

1. **Attraction** to someone based on psychological and/or physical characteristics  
the formula is highly complex and by no mean do I try to master it, but it's interesting to try list some factors- one's scent and overall physical chemistry- physical attributes, attitude or character that is reminiscent of one's figure contemplated in his environment or seems complementary at given time in their life- sexual desire also nurtured by the above, hormones and complex factors
2. **Projections**  
beyond attraction, projections nurture the idea that the object is able to respond to some human primary needs: affective, sexual, inner void, sense of meaning,...
3. **Chemical bound**  
when the two above are met, should it be instantly of after some time, chemical response will eventually bound the two and be identified as first sign of Love arisingI don't associate love with this chemical reaction, so that a crush is not necessarily Love, but it may start with it
4. **Pairing, needs bound and material strenghtening**  
pairing can take the form of an exclusive couple, or any other form (open relationship,...)but one's recognize his love and expresses it, and it's met with reciprocality in feelings.  
It comes with the charge  to participate in fulfilling part of affective needs of each otherIt's a contract which terms are not explicited, demanding active participation of both into fulfilling these needs.   
Both demand and love reinsurance can be expressed through a Love discourse (do you love me? I love you), or other active proofs overtime.  
There can be social constructs aiming at securing love (and therefore needs fulfillment) under forms of Marriage, family, material mutual possessions and life projects making it difficult, consciously but often inconsciously, to come to separation later. Not all of the listed is strictly deriving from need to secure love but they can be part of it
5. **Projections disappointment and Chemical bound fading**  
eventually one comes to realize the other is not up to his initial projections which can have effect on the chemical bound that therefore ceases to effect. it can be that one has his needs changing overtime which the other object cannot respond to due to his own characteristics that do not match anymoreIn any case, the chemical bound cannot be sustained overtime and certainly shouldn't have to. It can derive from the projections break it was primarily made to bound into pairing
6. **Attraction fading**  
as desire is nurtured in the absence and risk, and that such love object is easily accessible, attraction can also fade
7. **Attachment & some needs bound**  
what persists in the end can be attachment meaning habit and comfort in the romantic relationship, along with needs that can continue being satisfied. Great risk to it is boredom 

In light of the above, i've always seen love as an exchange of needs on basis of complex factors attraction and needs bounds. Two objects are using each others as to move on in life.I deeply struggle seeing the inherent virtue of this exchange, apart from common idea that it's a need we must compel to

I like to use **extremes to put to the test general ideas**:Now in application to the above

\- what if a man fells in love with a man who shares characteristics of an abuser, and gets being exploited as a prostitute. He will certainly feel Love, and who are we to question it? Some may say it's an exception because he's under influence, yet one can be attracted to abuser characteristics, and will be seeking such object of Love in life. 

\- what if a disabled man meets a woman who sees in him the possibility to achieve meaning in life while having sense of security since he is not able to harm her physically. Now this man recovers and she is losing power and meaning she once had. Remains eventually attachment which may fade with boredom. Was there virtue in this Love?

1701240806.0,my grandma just passed.,"TRIGGER WARNING (d3ath and grief) 

It has been one week since I lost my grandma. I’ve been helping take care of her for the last two years, until six months ago she had her first major stroke and I transitioned into taking care of her full time. She was my best friend, the first person to hold me after I was born, and the only person in the world which I had an unworldly connection with. I was the person who found her having a major stroke and had to call 911. She passed away two days later. I’m not a religious person, but in moments like these, I wish I were. I miss her so much. My heart aches every single day. My mom and her siblings grew up in my grandmas house. My grandpa helped build it in the 50s, and it’s one of the only original houses on my block. I’ve been living here with my uncle and my grandma for the last 3 years, but I also grew up here. My family is going to sell the house to a builder, and it makes me so frustrated to think about how we can’t afford to keep it. The house is going to be torn down and over time it’s going to be rebuilt over by some rich family, and my whole childhood home is going to be erased, like it was never there. I’ve been struggling with the idea of how we have such a short amount of time in this life. We have so little time to LIVE. Especially now adays, I feel like we have been robbed of our quality of life. When I see my uncle and the rest of my family I see the little kids they once were. Time slips by all of us, and we all grow up so fast. The people we love die. Our bodies grow old and we too will become just another portrait on our family’s wall. A distant memory. I’m so tired of living sometimes. I don’t know the point. I know life is beautiful and I am grateful to be here, but the pain which comes along with living is so heavy. I’m 23 and I know I am young, but I can’t help but think about my death. I just want to be little again. I want my family to be alive again. I can’t help but wonder if I really will see them again after death. What if there really is nothing and pure darkness? I can’t even imagine the day I lose my mother. I’m so tired. I miss my grandma.",1

1701288909.0,Please help i need to prove afterlife,"Let's just get straight to the point, it's paradoxical for afterlife to not exist as we conciousness are kind of bound to existance, for example when you fall asleep you wake up instantly as you experienced non existance which is not really somethin you can experience so you just skipped over it. The same could be said about afterlife, it can't be nothing because you can't experience nothing. But there are problems ive seen here, like what if consciousness can't be recovered when lost? This is a bit paradoxical because you can't experience non existance, but going back to maths, there is this paradox where it says no matter how many times you throw a dart at the board it will logically only land at the same place one time and never again. This is a big problem for afterlife because it could mean that things like consciousness could possibly happen once, but again maybe that is wrong because non existance can't be experienced but there is this paradox that says things are unrecoverable in this case making non existence experiancable. If we disprove the dart paradox and that things can happen once and never happen again we prove afterlife.",1
1701231758.0,There's actually a lot evidence for a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives,"This post relates to existentialism because ideas of a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives are often used to counter the idea the world is essentially absurd or meaningless apart from the meaning we arbitrarily ascribe to it. 

I think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit there is conflicting evidence as to the nature of a higher power and an afterlife, if such things exist. I also think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit that anything that can be attributed to the existence of an afterlife or a god has alternative explanations. 

All that said, many, many, many people throughout history testify to having convincing personal experiences of interacting with a higher power or having access to knowledge of an afterlife. 

Furthermore, it is in fact logical to conclude humans are incapable of fully comprehending most of our reality, so just the fact that it is thus far impossible to model or conceive of a scientifically supportable way for consciousness to persist beyond death does not mean consciousness does not persist beyond death. A caterpillar has no way of knowing it will become a butterfly, but it does all the same. A dog has no way of knowing it was the product of selective breeding from wolves, etc. etc.

Just as a pet hamster can never understand the myriad forces that lead it from a pet shop to a child's bedroom, perhaps we similarly cannot comprehend the god or gods involved in our lives.

It is, in fact, a faith-based proposition to assume humans are capable of creating a model that completely explains reality. If humans are like every other species we observe, then we must have limits we cannot surpass, no matter what, and we must be subject to forces, very probably including higher intelligences, that we can never understand. 

So, we KNOW we can't understand everything that affects us. And we KNOW that, if we are like every other observable life form, we are being influenced by HIGHER INTELLIGENCES. If there really is no higher intelligence beyond human intelligence in the universe, than humans are so exceptional that there probably IS a some sort of god responsible.

Combine the near certainty that we are influenced by higher intelligences with the extensive, albeit conflicting, reports of interactions with what appear to be higher powers, and the existence of AT LEAST one such being seems incredibly likely, if, of course, not at all certain.

If you want to take comfort in a godless and absurd universe and the end of consciousness after death, do so. But, similarly, if you want to take comfort in the idea of a greater purpose and an afterlife and a god or gods, do so as well because, MOST LIKELY (although it's impossible to say what the exact odds are) there IS something like a god and there IS something like an afterlife out there (the existence of the god-like being is more likely than the existence of an afterlife).

This does not mean you should abandon reason or critical thinking. Seeing reality for what it is doesn't mean making shit up to fill in what you don't know. For example, a preponderance of evidence indicates atheists can live long and happy lives, and there is certainly nob particularly convincing evidence they inevitably experience eternal punishment in the afterlife (if there is such a thing) either. 

Whatever you do, be open to the truth of reality and do not let your own assumptions override this truth. Try to recognize what you do not or cannot know with certainty, if at all.

Also, if you haven't actually had one of these seeming encounters with a higher power, don't be too quick to dismiss the experiences of those who have. I think a key aspect of these encounters are how convincing they are. It's possible to have the convincing experience without being sure of what you experienced. But if you've never found any ""encounter"" to be convincing, I would argue you've never actually had an encounter, not that you're just smarter or more of a critical thinker than the people who have.

The real test for the skeptic is being confronted with something that is TRULY convincing and still retaining their pre-existing views, which is definitely possible.

1701101233.0,I have reasons to believe in solipsism,"Solipsism is quite terrifying to me, and although there are arguments against it, I have come up with one for it.
I will try to articulate this as well as possible so bear with me.
Firstly, I don’t consider insects to be conscious. They are automatons, and respond to stimuli. A signal makes them run from a predator, or e.g photons enter their eyes, and notify the brain of  the presence of food, causing them to then head towards the food, and so on. They are basically relatively complex systems that respond to stimuli in certain ways. In the future, we could manufacture an ai that functions in the same way, but it wouldn’t have a consciousness. The AIs of today even have the capability to learn.
Let’s take this one step further. Consider a mouse. It is tremendously more complex than the insect, can respond to more external stimuli, can perform more complex actions etc. But just additional complexity shouldn’t create a “consciousness” if the insect doesn’t have it. Let’s go further, for example a monkey. The monkey is a very complex rendition of the insect, it can do a lot more, respond to a lot more and so on, but again, that wouldn’t create consciousness. Let’s now take this to a human. It’s the same deal. Why would the human be conscious, rather than an incredibly developed, complex automaton, like the insect, but has all the additional complexity of creativity, ingenuity, compassion etc. So one of the following things must be true:
 1. Solipsism is real
2. There is some sort of undiscovered “consciousness threshold, everything below it not having consciousness, and everything above it having it.
3. There is a supernatural factor at hand that we cannot prove",1

Problem is this discovery cannot be made empirically because matter does not hold the answers. Matter (as physics is starting to discover) is just a projection by our own consciousness. Rather the answers we seek lie in our consciousness and individual exploration of it will garner insights that lead the individual to the truth about this current dream enabling them to transcend it. This would be my attempt to bring meaning to this existent, does anyone else have similar meaning bringing frameworks? Or am I misunderstanding how existentialism works? Thanks",1

1700969973.0,Explicatio Infinitum-the Infinite Unfolding: Embracing expanding Consciousness with Hopeful and Pessimistic Optimism,"I saw a post on here the other day and thought to reply, but found myself falling so deeply into the idea that this demanded it's own post.

The post revolved around how there is no greater horror than consciousness and the realization of one's own consciousness. I can honestly say that even putting that as blatantly as stated is a vast understatement and it is objectively true- the expanding of consciousness and realization that all things act as a grand consciousness experiencing itself subjectively is a frightening prospect...

...but, I think that's only objectively true from a subjective standpoint- that is, the Human Experience. From the original Big Bang, consciousness has unfolded at an exponential rate- what started as simple elements and single celled organisms unfolded into multi cellular organisms, to Organisms hosting a plethora of Organelles, to Ecosystems, to the Evolutionary Demand of Sensory organs such as eyes, ears, mouths and Brains to decipher the information as each.

To view one's own thought process and to see it as this nearly mindless progression of thought after thought is a bit silly, but understandable: The mind wonders wildly and imaginatively uncontrollably, whether provoked or not. It is geared to keep fractaling out, over and over and over- from the inside out, it's frightening. but from the outside in? It's nothing less than completely beautiful: even in all of it's chaos, the inherent demand of nature to demand things out of itself to perceive itself simply for the sake of perceiving itself and pushing the bounds of what is to be perceived next is almost like a grand composure, or play, or symphony.

Upon this realization I couldn't help but imagine ""Longwu"" or ""Longdeng"", a celebratory chinese dance involving many performers using poles to rhythmically move a Dragon Prop- except in this dance, each person is branching off of one dragon to create another through another team of people, all dancing to ward off ""Evil Spirits"" or even the ""Ignorances of Evolution"" much how the Scientific Method is used to refute mundane Sciences which don't suit the needs of society or the world any longer. New Dragons Dance to decimate Old Ways of thinking like new technologies or new ideas come along to lay old one's to rest.

If the Ultimate meaning to existence is to create meaning in the absence of it, the universe itself compounds upon consciousness in order to create meaning of creating meaning of creating meaning of creating meaning infinitum- a cycle that repeats and repeats but gets bigger, wiser, better, and more accessible to the next offshoots of lineages and generations of all creatures.

Consciousness unfolds and unfolds and unfolds- and yes, it can absolutely lose meaning. But if you lose yourself in the Dance that proceeds all dances, suddenly you have become something as large as life itself and that is not just a beautiful thing, but a hopeful thing in the lieu of the hopelessness pronounced by the inability of escaping such a cycle.

*Just sharing what I wrote in my notes to myself about this*

“God” does exist, whatever she he or they may be, and they do have a purpose for us humans on this earth, but we just don’t know it yet and *that is the part that we’re supposed to figure out*. There is a clue though. What is insanely remarkable about our species is that we have made so much advancement in understanding the world and universe and life in such a relatively short period of time. So I believe that discovering our purpose will be found in further advancements in knowledge and technology. I mean just think about how truly fucking mindbending it is to think of the earth, assuming it and humans and society still exist, a thousand years from now. I would argue that there is no crazier of a thought one can have. Think of if you got a glimpse into that era. Think of if JESUS got a glimpse into todays era. Or Muhammad or Buddha. Would they be mind blown? Absolutely so. So with this, our purpose is to further our understanding of this all in every single avenue (doctors, coders, aerospace engineers, psychologists, artists, etc) so that we may perhaps find out some day. It’s easy to say that we never will right now, but as much as history repeats itself, it has been a linear advance of progress in knowledge in the long run. 

This is what I believe. I do believe in God and I will sometimes pray to him or thank him (calling him “him” out of cultural convention), but I just don’t know and I think he understands that. I think he wants me to understand it all better. That’s all",1

And now I realize that the problem isn’t just about Trump winning, even if Democrats win for the next 20 years, the next time a Republican wins they will enact their so called “project 2025” plan. They just have to score once and the game ends. Why has the Republican Party become this way? 

Where is the empathy? Respect? Tolerance? 

But I guess this problem is inherent to Democracy and it will never go away. We have to defend it forever. 

I’m just tired, I have enough with my personal problems and conflicts to also worry about all of this I mentioned. It becomes overwhelming. 

Hope is a dangerous thing. 

It might help if anyone could give any advice or just make me feel like I’m not alone in this. ",1

1700778174.0,"When we dont know for 100% certainty that what happens after death, why we doom children to face it?","First of all, this is not an antinatalism rant. It's just something that has been bothering my mind from a philosophical point of view.

Fear of death is universal within humanity. Some fear it more, some less. But 1 thing is clear: no one knows with 100% certainty that what will happen after death. And the dead haven't come back to tell about it. There are stories but no evidence. In other words, people die and they don't come back (at least not as who they were in this life). But what about the fact that unborn children can't die because only those who are born will die. If one is not born, they can't die and therefore can't face death.

Because there are 2 possible outcomes. Either there is nothing after death or there is something after death (aka an afterlife of sorts). Even if you come back, let's say hypothetically as a bird, that's still something instead of nothing (and birds can live horrible, painful lives). Even if you are not aware of it, the pain is still felt by the bird. We who are already alive, are doomed to face either 1 of these death outcome options. We don't know for 100% certainty which one it is but it has to be either one, right? Nothing or something. What else could it even be? And so if the best we got is ""*We don't know*"" then isn't it kinda... *cruel*... to create a conscious human being who will 100% certainly eventually die without knowing for certain what will happen to them afterwards?

Because what if what happens after death is a bad outcome? Like maybe not hell but you know, born again into a new being that has a way worse, more painful life etc.? Something like that, you get my point. The only way to prevent that kind of afterlife would be to not give birth to a new child since unborn can't die and therefore can't face death. And if one tries to argue with the ""*well, maybe pre-birth state is worse*"" then that thought gets really uncomfortable really, really fast... Since 99,999999999% of your potential children will never be born and can't be born. On average, there are 100 million sperms in 1 ejaculation and only 1 of those sperms will fertilize the egg. So are 99 999 999 potential ""souls"" doomed then in this pre-life state? A normal healthy human male can produce about 2 trillion sperms within his lifetime. Some Emperors have had like nearly 1 000 children. But that's still nothing compared to the potential ones they could've had. See where I'm getting at with this? So let's just say that the pre-birth state is pretty alright, it didn't mind you, didn't it, all those billions of years before you were born? I know that this is mostly just a thought experiment but I mean, I can't help but feel that there's a stain of cruelty in the fact that humans create new conscious beings that are doomed to die and we don't know what to tell them about what happens after death.

Thinking about being “nothing” scared the SHIT out of me at that age. To be fair it still does but I wish I was spared from those fears for a little while longer.

1700741863.0,"All wants are false, but some are useful","If you think about it, wants are basically just stories about scenarios or affairs _imagined_ to be pleasant or agreeable. For example, _I want chocolate cake._ This statement tells a story of an imagined scenario where there is me and cake, and in this tale I am happy about it.

In practice, however, none of the details are likely as true as the story would suggest. I cannot really know how events and feelings would unfold. And even then, the further entailment of later events could result in any number of misfortunes. On top of all that, what even _is_ ""I"" ? Is it the body right now? The mind? A figment of the imagination? Can we even be certain the one who gets the cake is the one who asked for it?

Coming back to the meaning and nature of wants, it would seem they are essentially stories of cause-and-effect. To _want_ cake is to believe that cake would bring happiness. This paints a pastry of causation between the entity that is me, and the creature that is cake. Such tales of causality are thus _models_ of reality.

Yet as the saying goes, _all models are wrong, but some are useful._ Therefore, it should follow, since wants are stories, and since stories are models, then _all wants are wrong, yet some are useful._ For example, I may be wrong in my imagined scenario of how things would actually unfold -- perhaps this particular time would defy expectation -- but the tale may nevertheless offer the energy needed to distract myself another moment from that inevitable finality which likely awaits.

In conclusion, what you chase may not -- and indeed almost certainly _does not_ -- actually exist. But this reality need not prevent your being from being consumed in the imaginary pursuit. The cake may not exist, yet your insatiable longing could move the world around you. The carrot is waiting. Won't you bite?",1

Not to say that I didn’t know I was going to die before, I did know. I was religious for most of my life, and then fell out of it at around 20 years old (escaped my church and found science and logic). I became an atheist and materialist. But I never truly considered the ramifications of what I believed (or didn’t believe, rather).

It is only with the passing of someone very close to me that I have started to realize that this life that we live in is one giant cosmic horror show. We are imbued with consciousness for whatever reason, and we are seemingly the only beings with the ability to grasp that we are conscious and dying. 

As far as the current scientific literature reaches, dying is like flipping off a light switch. You simply don’t exist anymore. I’ve seen a lot of people say that “you were dead for 17 billion years so it’s not going to bother you after you’re dead” and yes, I realize that. But it certainly is bothering me while I’m alive.

I am a wife and a mother, and I am very happy and content with my life. My life used to be horrible, but I made it into something nice. And now, my ability to enjoy what I have is crushed by the fact that everything I know and love, including my own own consciousness, will someday fade away into the eternal black void of nothing.

I want so badly to believe in some sort of extension of consciousness or soul or whatever, but my logical brain is not allowing me to do so, despite my best wishes. I wish I were not so damned aware.

Is love appreciation or association?
If you love a particular flower, do you associate yourself with it by feeling, and eventually picking it from the ground of which it was sprouted from, or do you appreciate it's beauty and elegancy by leaving it be?
I had a crush in the 5th Grade. I appreciated my time with them, yet I wanted to be associated with them through dating them. I don't know what they are doing now or if they're even alive, but I look back onto that day, and question if I ever truly appreciated them, or truly wanted to associate with them.

Nihilism is correlated with existential inquiry, but does not constitute a valid conclusion.

Existentialism exists *because* of a lack of conclusion.

Emotions are not conducive to rational thinking and objective assessment.

Existentialism is a space where people come to critique the human experience because they have a suspicion that things are not what the status quo asserts they are. 

When we profess that we know the meaning of life and it's meaningless, we have retired from the inquiry to allow our ego to lick its wounds.

I think it is time that critics of existentialism acknowledge that individual pathology does not define the genre.

Correlation alone does not prove causation.

Things like holy war, genocide, terrorism and torture may be strongly correlated with religious beliefs but that does not equate to absolute proof of causation.

Existentialism is intensely uncomfortable for people who feel a need to control their reality, because they find that down here everyone is a hypocrite, we are all equally flawed, and there is no chance at supremacy or progress.

I often ask myself why I bother, but I feel a deep sense of obligation to humble myself by witnessing this phenomena because I have experienced enough trauma, injustice and absurdity to land me next to Job in the Bible and I'm tired of watching everyone else lie to themselves and perpetuate the cycle of hubris.

I am also addicted to the fleeting glimpses of ego death, they are the most pleasurable experiences I have ever had, and they have helped me overcome my own mental health woes more effectively than any medicine or therapy.

Anyhow, when it comes down to it, we can put a line between ""Western ideologies"" (be they philosophical or religious) and ""non-Western ones"", and that might be a bit reductive, but I think you get the point that I will make. So, in the majority of Western ideologies, especially religion, people see life and death as two separate things, right? Life is now, death is after; is there a heaven? Hell? Nothing? Mind you, atheists or people, who hold generally average religious-ish beliefs, they still perceive life in ""I exist now"" and ""I won't exist then.""   


Okay, cool, however I, recently, had this moment of clarity; it's a lie. As in, life and death are not opposing forces, nor are they two different forces to begin with - rather, what we call life and death are one thing, that simply, as the universe as a whole, shifts and changes with time. Even though I am agnostic, you could say that I believe in reincarnation, but not in a spiritual way, but (as much as you can say that, of course) logical way. I try to base my hypothetical beliefs in some object facts to give them some ground (even though I believe that object reality does not exist, however) and this is why I thought of the concept that ""nothing comes from nothing and something cannot be utterly destroyed"". Thinking about it and recent discoveries in concepts of quantum physics, quantum information, and elasticity of dark matter (or was it anti-matter? (that might suggest that, rather than expending forever, galaxy will reach a point before snapping back in)) I came to this idea that after ""death"" you don't simply cease to be, but rather, thing that makes you you (soul, energy, consciousness, mind, spirit, call it however) goes on to make something new (same how rotting corpse feeds new life) or it gets broken down to its most basic components and then gets recycled anew (perhaps sapient life is peak of existence and, after that, essence breaks down and begins to reshape anew, same how stars and planets in the universe became denser and more complex with time)   


To that end, life and death are not two separate things, they are one thing, flowing - therefore, being alive is nothing more than just being ""awake for a moment"", similarly how you can be awake and asleep. Life, you can say, is a moment of lucidity in your infinity of existence. That, of course, would still get into the idea that you, the real you, your personality, is dead upon your, well, death, but I might have an idea for that too; I mentioned the concept of quantum information before, and while it is still in it's early stage, there is an idea that information can leave an imprint on the very fabric of time and space. That's how, for example, theoretically, we could trace that information to before the Big Bang and see how it went down; and, theoretically, if such advanced technology were to exist, who to say that it would not be able to reconstruct the history of humanity from the imprint that it left on the fabric of time and space, same how they could read the beginning of Big Bang? That would give an explanation to people seeing their dead loved ones in dreams; if your very being, who you were, left an imprint on fabric of time and space, you, similarly, don't simply cease to be, but rather, remain part of existence forever.   


While I know that this might come off as optimistic or religious, I do mean it in a very logical sense; we, humans, perceive time as a continuous thing, that as past, present, and future. However, there is nothing objective to suggest it is really such, and therefore, time might be a singular thing, the singular is. To that end, if physical things leave imprints of the fabric of time and space (or reality, if you wish), if material leaves a mark on immaterial, who is to say that your very being won't be part of this everpresent is?   


I always struggled with the idea of death and annihilation of existence, not because it scares me (though it does) but because it simply seems so illogical and unnatural to how the rest of the universe works. After some time thinking, this is what I got. ",1

I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 and on Reddit and discord since then. I’ve always asked for help I’ve always done things to get better. I studied nihilism, existentialism, epistemology and many parts of philosophy. 

My favorite philosophers were Immanuel Kant, Rene Descartes, Frederick Nietzsche, Spinoza, and even Ludwig Wittgenstein. Please do not call me an idiot in the comments or test my education just to annoy me. All I m asking for is a second opinion not an interrogation of my life and challenges to my knowledge. I must admit I’m not smart at all

I just feel so misunderstood, no amount of philosophy or science and even religion has done anything to improve my life.none of it applies to me. I’m not asking for more money or to look physically better. Those are always a good thing but I seriously ask for someone to touch my soul. I feel like no one gets my struggle and many people underestimate my struggle. I’ve been to mental hospitals and done therapy. That shows just how desperate I am. No matter what I do or try. No matter who I talk to. No matter the location the person and their credentials none of it applies to me. None of it makes me happy none of it truly lights a spark in my brain intellectually or brightens me spiritually.

I’ve been making posts like this since I was 14 years old. I’m quite the patient person. Most people in my situation would gladly jump in a trains path. But I am patient and I do not feel the need to cry about my problems. I am trying to improve.

1700473178.0,Do people just accept the circumstances we exist under?,"A rant about every single condition of existence.

I (22F) am someone who has never understood the social contracts of reality. Why can’t I say what I want when I am thinking it? Examples that come to mind are sororities and corporate offices. 

Like, who is subjecting themselves to these environments voluntarily and not questioning the structures that attempt to control and regulate our emotions and behaviors? 

Why does everyone tell me to “chill” when I say the thought of sending corporate friendly emails for the rest of my life makes me want to tear my own skin off. Do people not think this is weird? Like I have to work a job (which by the way most jobs are made up to sustain the unnecessary eccentricities of existence) in order to make money in order to eat food and provide shelter and survive.

Like… does that not seem kind of barbaric? And I have to wear loafers and pants while doing it? Everyone else just agrees to do this and now I’m subjected to it too?? 

Another thing. What’s the point of old politicians grasping onto power in their dying years. When I realized that many politicians only incentive was to gain power as an individual, and not for any larger purpose. I was mind blown. Like… that’s just a super strange avenue to seek power for powers sake. 

Ok lastly. I have no career ambitions, no desire to have children, no desire to pursue a romantic relationship. I wanted to be famous in some capacity when I was growing up but I think I just wanted attention. So now I’m just alive and unemployed looking for a job while contemplating the purpose of having to have a linked in account. Like I truly do not care about what my peers are doing, and why must I be business formal on a form of social media. Give me a break. 

I know I could pursue simpler avenues of life that don’t exist in corporate spaces but idk I haven’t come to terms with it yet. 

I always wished I was a Christian who never questioned my faith and became an elementary school teacher. Instead, I was raised atheist by an engineer and a chemist.  And a father with a masters in philosophy. So that was never my fate. 

Now I just wallow in self pity and grow jealous of people with purpose or those who are aware of the conditions of suffering but just accept it. And a part of me wishes that there’s an afterlife so I can see my dog again. Anyways.. there’s no question. Just contemplating the circumstances of the human condition.",1

1700310789.0,Am I an existentialist?,"Hey y’all, basically I am what many here in this sub have called a “biological determinist” due to my observation through science of how our brain works and the most simple explanation of consciousness is that it is simply a perception of those neural cascades and that cognitive awareness itself creates this existencial layer to reality. In essence we are causally determined down to the quantum level as far as science has been able to observe, above that level we are a chain of dominos, our conscious perception a window into reality. However to add onto that I too have felt a visceral connection to the universe and others around me that would have me posit that there is so much more than our human perception. We are all connected and windows into the same universe, we are the universe experiencing itself.

However, I then see the viability of existentialism and even sopholism for their focus on free will and the conscious mind, becuase that is how we must on this level derive ethics and how to coexist. Yet maintaining in mind that is is all just the experience of a passing moment in the universe, no true “control” or at least evidence thereof.

And then I am open to the possibility of anything beyond the realm of what we have been able to observe in science, what if perhaps our brains and senses act as a sort of sounding rod or grounding wire for the consciousness of the universe itself? Maybe it guides us quantumly, maybe our act guides it similar to that story of the egg, maybe this is the matrix. Honestly I don’t know and choose to not believe so wholeheartedly or dogmatical in anything beyond the realm of scientific evidence.

Anyway if any of y’all have anything to say on my ramblings as a causal determinist avid in entheogens, I’m all ears :)

I got home super excited and hugged her. I felt her skin and it was so thin. Ik it's a weird detail but it really freaked me out.

This blog explores the relevance of Seneca's teachings in the 21st century and how they can provide a philosophical anchor that transcends the ages.

It delves into the relevance of Seneca's teachings on virtue, resilience, and mindful living in the context of contemporary life. Seneca's steadfast advocacy for virtue as the highest good provides a compass for ethical decision-making in a world often characterized by moral ambiguity and shifting values. Meanwhile, his insights on resilience and reason offer a Stoic framework for navigating the challenges of a fast-paced life with grace and composure.

Seneca's philosophy also challenges prevailing norms of consumerism and the pursuit of financial success by encouraging reflection on our relationship with possessions and the true meaning of wealth. It concludes by exploring practical applications of Seneca's philosophy in the modern world and how individuals can integrate these principles into their daily lives to foster a resilient mindset, ethical decision-making, and a mindful approach to success and well-being.

In summary, Seneca's timeless wisdom offers actionable insights for those seeking a more intentional and fulfilling existence in our fast-paced contemporary world. Despite the temporal abyss that separates us, his teachings remain a beacon of light, guiding us toward a more meaningful and virtuous existence in the modern world.",1
1699981999.0,Existentialism and Love,"I want to reflect on love. To do so, I remember Martin Buber’s I-You versus I-It distinction. There is no such thing as an “I” in existence. “I” can only occur in a relation to something or someone else. He writes, “The basic word I-You can be spoken only with one’s whole being. The concentration and fusion into a whole being can never be accomplished by me, can never be accomplished without me. I require a You to become; becoming I, I say You (62).” 

This is a poetic way of describing, I think, the call I find again and again in existentialism to be open to another person, to care for another person, to love another person. To love in the correct way is not a flight from myself, but rather a return to myself. A becoming of myself. 

I am re-reading Kierkegaard’s Works of Love, and I am continually challenged, offended, and elevated by his description of the strenuous task of loving my neighbor. I ought not possess my neighbor. I cannot ensure that my love for my neighbor will be received as love. So many attempts that I might make to love my neighbor sincerely might actually hide underlying selfish motivations to seem to be this or that kind of person. 

We often describe the “nothing” that underlies human existence in nihilistic terms, as a groundless vacuity from which we were hurled at birth and into which we will be sucked back again at death. But I also see this “nothing” as the openness that makes the possibility of an encounter with another person possible. From this emptiness, I am open. I am without judgment. I am available to you and therefore to myself.

The following argument is based on those two facts. \[If the list of sensations were changed (for example, I might divide thought into 1) creative thought, as when I write a short story, 2) logical thought, as when I follow a mathematical proof, and 3) just thought, as in “What am I going to have for lunch?”), that wouldn’t change the argument.\]

So, I directly experience the sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, emotion and thought. That’s ALL I directly experience. I do not directly experience matter because I have no sense that directly detects matter. Matter is a theoretical construct. Matter is an idea I use to make sense of sensations.

For instance, I have a particular visual sensation and think the idea of “coffee mug.” The idea tells me what tactile sensations to expect if I touch the cup, what visual sensations to expect if I rotate the cup, what auditory sensations to expect if I drop the cup.

I do not have a special coffee mug sense that directly allows me to experience a coffee cup. So, I cannot directly experience the coffee mug. Rather, I experience sensations that together correspond to the existence of a coffee cup. All of the sensations I associate with the idea of coffee mug could occur in a vivid dream. In the dream, the sensations would exist, but no coffee mug would exist.

I can be 100% certain of what I directly experience. If I have the visual sensation of water, the sensation is unarguable. The water may or may not exist; if I’m seeing a mirage, no water exists.

I’m like a security guard that takes an elevator to the 12th floor and watches monitors of the loading dock, stairwells, etc. but who is never allowed outside the monitoring room. All I directly experience is images on monitors. The dock, stairwells, etc. may indeed exist. But I never directly experience them.

In philosophy, we have Descartes’ evil demon. We have the brain in a vat. We have the idea that the universe is a simulation. And there’s the Matrix movies. All point to the fact that we do not directly experience matter and that matter may be no more than a theological construct.

Matter is a very good theory. It’s a wonderful working hypothesis that explains what I experience. But, in the final analysis, matter remains a theoretical construct. Matter is an idea I use to explain and understand what I actually directly experience, i.e., sensations in consciousness.

All I can be 100% certain about is the existence of sensations in consciousness.

Basically I had lost everything I ever had and what made me in a change of a year. I will not like to explain every little thing but the point is the fine line was crossed. The boundary was broken. I had went to a happy and charmingly humurous kid to a lifeless robot eve as a child of 12. At the age of 12 speaking. I had been fascinated with psychology at the time and wanted to learn more to be a psychologist. Although I never got diagnosed with any mental illness or been hospitalized I still had a fascination with the brain and helping people. This is after I had denied the existence of mental illness. I never had any sympathy for people with mental illness as I thought the majority of their problems were made up. But then one thing leads to another and I was the most mentally ill and lonely 12 year old I knew. And that continued on to teenage and adult years. This is all to say you can be happy and giggly.

One could say life is precious to the individual withholding it, but why? Is life a test? Is someone watching over us? Even if, do you have any proof? You could utilize historic evidence as 'plausible' proof, but what makes it plausible? Just because it aligns with a holy book doesn't mean it was exaggerated.

We might just truly achieve freedom. But it can't be just tens of millions of people; it needs to be everyone.

Don't be fooled by the money they offer. Don't be fooled by the falsity of freedom we are offered. At this time and point, it is practically impossible to start a rebellion. There will always be those who don't bother, there will always be those who don't understand, and there will always be those who are under the false impression created by the higher-ups. These higher-ups are truly the ones living the life, the life that not even the richest of the rich can live; rather, something more than that.

He quotes Dostoyevsky, who claimed that existence is meaningless if one does not believe in eternity/God. Here is the quote by Dostoyevsky:
> “Since in reply to my questions about happiness, I am told,
> through the intermediary of my consciousness, that I cannot be
> happy except in harmony with the great all, which I cannot
> conceive and shall never be in a position to conceive, it is evident...”

> ""... and since I consider this comedy perpetrated by nature altogether
> stupid, and since I even deem it humiliating for me to deign to play it ...”

> “In my indisputable capacity of plaintiff and defendant, of
> judge and accused, I condemn that nature which, with such
> impudent nerve, brought me into being in order to suffer—I
> condemn it to be annihilated with me.”

And Camus summarizes Dostoyevsky's thoughts with this sentence:
> ""Existence is illusory **OR** it is eternal.""

Meaning that either God exists and we would have eternal existence (souls and stuff), or not, in which case we would have a short life and then a permanent death which would erase our existence, making it somewhat illusory/temporary.

Then, throughout the chapter Camus analyzes how Dostoyevsky's characters Kirilov (from the novel Demons) and the Karamazov bros (from the novel The Brothers Karamazov) deal with the problem of existence, either by committing suicide (like Kirilov), by admitting the absurdity and incomprehensibility of existence (like Ivan Karamazov), or by taking a leap of faith and believing in God (like Alyosha Karamazov).

The chapter concludes with this:
> ""The surprising reply of the creator to his characters, of Dostoevsky to Kirilov,
> can indeed be summed up thus: existence is illusory **AND** it is eternal.""

From ""illusory OR eternal"" it changed to ""illusory AND eternal"" at the end of the chapter. What do you think this means?",1

## After Life

One of the ego’s prime motivations is survival; one of its prime fears is death. If death is the end, then we simply cease to exist—an idea that horrifies some people.

What happens to me after death? Do I survive in some form or another? We’ll explore the questions and *speculate* about some answers, without pretending to any special knowledge as to what actually occurs.

## After Life: Heaven and Hell

One answer to the question of what happens after death is that my eternal soul survives. Some religions say the soul exists for all eternity, ultimately in either heaven or hell.\[i\] The soul is not God. It is separate and distinct from God. It is ontologically basic. God creates the soul but once created, it exists for all eternity.

The idea of an eternal heaven and hell raises some problems.

The first problem is that heaven or hell seem inappropriate for the great majority of people, who live moderately good lives (but don’t dedicate themselves to helping the poor, or to ceaselessly praying to God) and moderately bad lives (sometimes dishonest or selfish or unkind).

The second problem concerns the nature of the self. Over a lifetime, a person will have many selves, e.g., the infant, the student; the employee; the spouse, the parent, the grandparent. Given that temporary selves come and go, we may ask: Which of our many temporary selves persist into the afterlife? Which selves go to heaven (or hell)?

Consider, for example, Saint Augustine, who was sexually active in his youth, fathering a son with a woman he never married. He famously prayed: “God, give me chastity and continency, only not yet.” Later, he repented and became a saint. Did Augustine’s erotic self go to heaven along with his saintly self? 

Or consider Zoe, a sweet old woman who passed at 90. Imagine Zoe had a characteristic fault, say, envy. If Zoe goes to heaven, does her envious self go there, too?

Another problem: once in heaven can I change and grow? Can I gain and lose temporary selves? Suppose Ann, Zoe’s granddaughter, looks forward to meeting Zoe in heaven. Ann remembers Zoe as she was at 90. But suppose in heaven Zoe prefers her 19-year-old body to her 90-year-old body. And suppose Zoe’s envious self no longer exists. And suppose Zoe has satisfied a lifelong wish to understand Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Being in heaven, she can easily fulfill that wish. When Ann finally meets Zoe in heaven, does she meet the person she expected to meet? Or a disappointingly different person?

Further, in heaven, Zoe can learn anything she wishes and—within limits—become anything she wishes. Within limits. But eternity is a long, long, long time. After untold billions and trillions of years, do the limits chafe? Might Zoe eventually desire the ultimate: to become God? The legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven seems to answer “Yes.” The story suggests eternal existence as a separate person may ultimately become unsatisfying. Perhaps only God can withstand eternity.

Millions long for immortality who don't know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon. — Susan Ertz

Another observation is that heaven and hell make the universe (also called “creation”) pointless. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Eventually, only heaven and hell will exist. Many Christians believe that will occur at the second coming of Jesus. A Catholic might say later, after all the souls in purgatory have paid their debt and migrated to heaven. But Christians agree that at some time in the future only heaven and hell will exist.

2. Before creation, God knew exactly which people would end up in heaven and which people would end up in hell (assuming God can foresee the future).

3. God could have created people destined for heaven IN HEAVEN, bypassing life on earth entirely. God could have created people destined for hell IN HELL, bypassing life on earth entirely.

4. Conclusion: The entire drama of creation—the Fall, the passion of Jesus, etc., etc.—is entirely unnecessary. God could have skipped creation entirely. God could have created in heaven people who God knew would go there. God could have created in hell people who God knew would go there. (A kinder, gentler God would have simply not created people who would end up in hell.)

It seems there are logical problems with the idea of an eternal soul and an eternal heaven and hell.\[ii\] Of course, if eternally individual souls in an eternal heaven or hell were ever proven to exist then we’d need to revise or abandon our basic premise of monism—something we should always be willing to do if we want to follow the evidence.

## After Life: Reincarnation

Another answer to the question of what happens to me after death is that I eventually reincarnate. To be more precise, the permanent self and some traits and tendencies\[iii\] eventually reincarnate. This idea occurs in Hinduism where, in one version, the *jivatma* is the individual soul which reincarnates but “after a long process of development and experience again returns to the unity of the Ātmā,”\[iv\] i.e., the One. In this view, a permanent individual self is not eternal; it ultimately merges back with the One, from whence it came, as a river merges with the ocean.

Buddhism also has the idea of reincarnation except in Buddhism no permanent self exists. Buddhism says that the permanent self is illusory. It says there is nothing underlying the temporary selves that come and go.\[v\] We are at any time merely a bundle of our current temporary selves. This idea occurs in Buddhism’s *Anatta*\[vi\] doctrine (non-self doctrine) which says I consist only of the “five aggregates”: perception, material form, feelings, mental activity, and consciousness. At death, the five aggregates cease to function or disperse (as the atoms of our body return to the biosphere) and I simply cease to exist.

Yet Buddhism accepts that reincarnation is possible. Reincarnation of what? A difficult question. One answer is that, as in Hinduism, some residue of our temporary selves somehow forms the personality of a newborn. Just as one candle lights another, passing on its flame, somehow our tendencies pass on to another being, a being which also lacks a permanent self.

## After Life: Between Lives

Let’s suppose I and the body have parted, but I’m still am aware of thoughts and emotions. I as consciousness along with some emotional and mental tendencies somehow continue to exist. What would it be like? Like dreaming? Like being alone in a dark room?

Like being trapped in some closed, confined space? No. If I’ve left the body, then I am spaceless. Without a body, what is there to be confined? Can a box confine thought? Can a box limit emotion? Can a box imprison consciousness? Evidently not. So, let’s imagine the emotion/thought/consciousness complex free floating, in some vast space, or a place where the word “space” has no meaning.

A fish freed from a bottle, swimming in a vast ocean, might look back at the bottle and notice how small and limiting the bottle was. We might reflect on what the body/emotion/mind complex usually contained: merely pleasant or unpleasant body sensations, happy or sad emotions, thoughts of various kinds. Nothing profound, usually. We might see memory, too, and all the past snapshots memory holds. And it all might seems so . . . small. Finite. Interesting in its own way. But does it all merit remembering? Or can much of it be forgotten?\[vii\] Most people are born with no memory of a past life. And for those that do claim memories of a past life, the memories are often of a traumatic incident such as being executed or dying in some accident. If we reincarnate, do we routinely forget most of our past life?\[viii\]

Let’s now imagine consciousness in the between-lives state. *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*\[ix\] describes what occurs, according to Tibetan belief. Briefly, the consciousness/tendencies complex begins a natural ascent to its source, its ultimate ground: the Real. On first encountering the Incomprehensible Boundless Light, some deceased persons merge, losing their separate identity and ending reincarnations. Other deceased persons retreat from the intensity of supreme naked reality, and descend to lower levels of existence. The text describes the deceased as experiencing “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities before finally incarnating in a physical body. We might imagine some deceased persons able to wander in the Mindscape, sampling thoughts and ideas as they please. We might imagine others wandering the Emotescape, sampling emotions of all kinds. Others descend to the physical plane, taking birth in another body, previous existence having been mostly forgotten, although there are stories of young children recalling scenes from an alleged previous life. Reincarnation has occurred.

*The Tibetan Book of the Dead* says the “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities are projections of one’s own mind. We might imagine experiencing peaceful deities as heaven and wrathful deities as hell. But why would our own mind create such experiences?

Imagine a loving person who spent their life helping others, trying to make the world a better place. A person who thought, mostly, kind, loving and noble thoughts. That person alone with his/her emotions and thoughts would be in a light, elevated place: a “heaven.”

On the other hand, imagine a person who spent a life filled with greed, hate, and anger alone with those emotions. He will have no one to hate but himself. No one to be the target of his anger but himself. The experience would be a dark, oppressive state: a “hell.”

Thus, there could be a type of judgment built into the universe, without the need of some God who is a person. A judgment based on the fact that it’s more comfortable to experience love rather than hate, more comfortable to experience peace rather than violence. There could be a temporary, non-eternal heaven and hell awaiting us in the between-lives state.

## After Life: No Afterlife

Death is when the body ceases to function. Perhaps our emotional and mental activities also cease to exist. Perhaps, our consciousness ceases to function, too. Consciousness seems to disappear during deep sleep, so it’s easy to believe it ceases to exist after death.

So, another answer is that at death my deep self and temporary selves simply cease to exist. One moment I’m consciousness—let’s say, right now. The next moment Arthur is nowhere to be found.\[x\] His permanent self, if he had one, has vanished. Death is the end, utter annihilation.

Let’s suppose for a moment that this is the case; that when I die, I utterly cease to exist. Many people would find the idea frightening, even horrifying. However, if I cease to exist, I won’t be there to know it. The thought is not so threatening when I realize that I can never experience the state of non-existing.\[xi\] After I realize that, ceasing to exist may seem less fearful, even inconsequential. For, if we rule out reincarnation, then before I existed, I couldn’t experience anything, including the state of non-existing.

“I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” — Mark Twain

Similarly, if I utterly cease to exist after death, I’ll never know it. I’ll never experience it. I can only experience the thought of non-existing. A thought may be sad or frightening, but it’s still only a thought. Thoughts come and go.

Sadness might be a more appropriate response. For if I cease to exist upon death, then all those who have died previously—family members, friends, acquaintances—have ceased to exist, too. If that were true, it would be natural to experience sadness.

Many people are deeply attached to the idea of an eternal soul, or to some sort of continued existence. The no-afterlife answer may appear threatening and frightening. It’s natural that an ego would regard non-existence as a horror.

A response is that being a soul—being an eternal individual, eternally separate from God—may not be so desirable, as we noted previously in the legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven.

Also, we can contrast the idea of an eternal soul with another, possibly superior, concept. The idea of an eternal soul says we came *into* the universe. It suggests we are not a part of nature, but spiritual visitors in a material world. Thus, the only world we know is depreciated. Matter is dumb and “there must be something more.” And the environment suffers abuse.

A possibly superior concept is that we didn’t come coming into the universe; we came *out of* it.\[xii\] Our relation to the universe is like that of the apple to the apple tree. That I (or, at least, my body) came out of the universe is why the common elements of the universe (with one exception) are the common elements of my body. The most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, in descending order. Helium is a noble gas that doesn’t combine with other elements to form molecules. If we discard helium, we find that the most abundant elements in the human body are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, in descending order.

The universe has become me (and everything else). And we know matter is hardly dumb. Rather, it contains complexity beyond imagination. In trying to understand matter, we are forced to ideas like string theory and quantum field theory, complex theories that may not be complex enough to capture all that matter can do.

If we call matter “dumb” we insult ourselves, because matter is what we are. If we understood ourselves correctly—as temporary manifestations of something vast and ancient beyond comprehension—that would be enough.

So, suppose death is the utter end to Arthur. So what? Why should I care if my finite self persists beyond the life of the body? Most of the time, my finite self focuses on corresponding finite concerns - how to be comfortable; how to gain wealth, power and fame—or focuses on entertainment that puts the mind in a passive state, so that I can hardly remember an advertisement I saw just a few minutes ago. Of course, our lives are also filled with noble moments, too. Moments of love, of empathy, of elevated thoughts. But these moments pale measured against our infinite self, our vast and ancient larger self, the universe itself.

Perhaps, eternal existence as a limited, finite self is not as desirable as it seems. In any case, it can be argued that non-existence is nothing to fear.

## Self-Transcendence

Suppose I am entirely physical. Suppose I am matter and only matter, matter that somehow is conscious and intelligent. Suppose my destiny as an individual is annihilation. When I die, I utterly cease to exist. The biosphere absorbs my body’s atoms. My emotions, mind, and consciousness simply cease to be. This idea may seem unwelcome, threatening, and frightening. But considered deeply, it can lead to self-transcendence. And self-transcendence can be viewed as a type of salvation, salvation from fear of death.

As we’ve seen, if I’m merely matter, matter which lacks a soul, then it’s plain that I didn’t come into the universe; I came out of it. My body emerged from the universe. I emerged from the universe. I am not separate from the universe but a part of it. The universe gave me birth. It is my parent. Something which is ancient and vast beyond imagination has given me birth. I am a person on a planet with billions of other people, a planet that is a microscopic speck of dust in an almost infinite universe.

I am a small speck. Yet, I can contemplate the vast and ancient universe. I feel my small presence in the infinite universe and the feeling is an odd mixture: one part realizing my own smallness and insignificance; one part feeling a part of a vast, magnificent universe, no matter if only an infinitesimally small part. The universe has created me. I am not the universe but the universe is me, just as the wave is not the ocean but the ocean is the wave. Something ancient and vast has become me. 

*The God’s Script****\[xiii\]*** by Jorge Luis Borges tells the story of Tzinacán, an Aztec priest imprisoned and tortured by the Spaniards. After decades in prison, Tzinacán has a vision; he believes certain words of power will destroy his stone prison, evict the Spaniards, reconstruct his nation, and make him immortal. But he knows he never shall utter the words, because “Whoever has seen the universe, whoever has beheld the fiery designs of the universe, cannot think in terms of one man, or that man’s trivial fortunes or misfortunes, though he be that very man.”

Tzinacán has achieved salvation, salvation from ego concerns, a type of salvation unlike the ego salvation of Old Theology religions.

We live in an unimaginably vast and ancient universe. Yet, our concerns often revolve about ourselves. Ego issues dominate: “I want to go to heaven. I want to be reincarnated. I. Me. I.” Ego concerns are understandable; they help us survive. But the person who can self-transcend, who can rise above ego; the person who can say to the Real, “You exist. And that’s enough for me. *What does it matter if this finite, flawed human being lives for eternity, or is snuffed out like a candle?*”—that person has a faith and a love for God far above those who practice religion out of fear of hell, hope of heaven, or of a better reincarnation.

A person who achieves that perspective while still in the body has achieved some degree of self-transcendence. That person finds their “I” in the Real rather than in the ego and its transitory selves. Mystic slogans such as “Die before you die” and “The art of dying” take on a real, literal meaning. Self-transcendence utterly defeats death. For if I die to my transitory selves before the death of my body, then there is nothing that death can take.

## After Life: Recap

To sum up, an axiom of New Theology’s monism is that only the All and the One, the Ultimate Ground of Existence, is ontologically basic. The individual is not ontologically basic. This implies that the human individual is like a figure on a movie screen and would cease to exist but for the action of the light; that the individual is the wave, not the ocean. This view admits two possibilities. First, that upon death the individual simply dissolves, ceases to be. This is often the view of the atheist.\[xiv\] The second is that upon death the individual continues to exist in one form or another, perhaps in heaven or hell, perhaps reincarnating eventually.

Although our fate immediately after death is unknown, in a monist system the ultimate fate of the individual can be nothing other than merging with the ultimate ground of all.

You are not the body. You are not the mind.

You are something different, lying far behind.

\[i\] The after-death destination of Limbo once existed in the Roman Catholic Church but has recently fallen out of favor.

\[ii\] Existence in heaven raises other questions about selfhood. Consider the idea of an assembly of selves. Suppose Joe at six years old was happy and optimistic; a more mature person when he received his first romantic kiss; at twenty, a personal tragedy turned him pessimistic and dour; at forty, Joe was a sober, responsible family man; at death, a calm, retired introvert. Is Joe in heaven somehow a composite of all these selves? If Joe goes to hell, do all the selves suffer, even the happy, optimistic six-year older?

\[vi\] (Annata, n.d.) “In Buddhism, the term anattā (Pali) or anātman (Sanskrit) refers to the doctrine of ""non-self"" – that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self, anatman is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non-attachment by recognizing anything as impermanent, while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence. In contrast, Hinduism asserts the existence of Atman as pure consciousness or witness-consciousness, reifying consciousness as an eternal self.

1699630568.0,Borderline Consciousness,"Hello! This is my first time ever posting  anything on Reddit, but it seems a good opportunity to do so.

I’m in the process of creating a paper for my philosophy of mind class and the (incomplete) thesis I’m exploring is the idea that consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomenon. A rock is not conscious and I am not conscious, but there is no discrete border between the conscious and non-conscious.

My first main argument in favor of this idea is rooted in evolution. The evolution argument is basically just a chicken-egg argument in regard to consciousness. 

1. At some point in my ancestral history, there was a non-conscious being 
2. I am currently conscious(I think)
3. It’s counterintuitive to think that a being’s parent could be non-conscious and its child be conscious 
4. C: Consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomena, it emerges gradually.

My second main argument is based on the concept of emergent properties.

1. We are made up of many non-complex, non-conscious materials
2. In the assembly of all of these materials into a conscious being, it seems absurd to think one single atom or molecule would shift the being from non-conscious to conscious
3. C: Consciousness is not an all or nothing phenomenon, it emerges gradually.

I’m also planning on constructing an argument around birth and death, but that isn’t fleshed out yet.

I would really appreciate help/advice with a few things.

1. How are these arguments, is there anything essential about either point that I’ve missed?
2. What are some potential counter arguments that I should consider?
3. Are there any sources I should I look at that would help me with either my arguments or counter arguments?
4. What do you think of this overall argument?

Unrelated to the paper, I’d love to hear how people think this idea fits into existentialist or other philosophical frameworks. I’ve recently learned about epiphenomenalism and find it to be an incredible theory of the mind. I think it really aligns well with this argument, and I was also wondering how people feel about epiphenomenalism in regard to existentialism?",1

1699574982.0,Is there a scientific explanation to this?,"This is my first time posting anything on Reddit. I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit, but as somebody who frequently contemplates existential topics, I feel it might be of some use to some of you. 7 years ago I had an encounter that I can't figure out. This is something that has been on my mind for 7 years and I have contemplated and gone through it over and over in my own mind since it happened and it still stumps me.

Before I get into the details I want to get a few things straight. I'm not a religious nut, neither am I a staunch atheist (and I also want to make it clear I would never hold either those things against somebody...unless they were total nutters lol). I enjoy the exploration of 'deep' topics, but I would absolutely never consider myself a philosopher or somebody that has an in-depth knowledge of science or the human mind and what it is capable of. I like to have an objective perspective on life, with room to contemplate and appreciate what an incredible thing life is regardless of how or why we're here.

Okay that all sounds a little deep, but I feel I have to get it out of the way before I get to the meat of this post. 7 years ago I was in my second year of university in Manchester (UK) and living with one of my best friends from school (Harry). This was during an particularly turbulent part of my life, but in retrospect a care-free and enjoyable one. Myself and my friend would spend time playing video games, going to the pub, waking up late...basically your typical student life in the UK (which of course included the end of term stressed catch up of work and exams).

One evening myself and my friend Harry were chatting over a cup of tea, the pair of us on our own arm chairs. Though plenty of evenings were spent drinking, this particular one was a sober one and it was no different than most weekdays. For some reason or another we got on to the topic of God, belief, afterlife, atheism, etc. This wasn't something completely out of the ordinary and wasn't a topic we hadn't already covered in conversation as friends before.

After about 5 minutes of chatting, contemplating etc, what I can only describe as an overwhelming feeling of comfort, joy and warmth fell over me. It felt like a deep feeling of peace had washed over me and I was bathing in what felt like the warmth you'd feel sat in the sun on a warm summers day.

Now I'd objectively put this down to some obvious explanation, but as it was happening I looked over to Harry who's eyes were wide open and shocked and he simply said ''do you feel that'', with this sense of fear in his voice. I couldn't believe that we both felt this overwhelming feeling at the same time. It lasted a good 5/10 minutes before disappearing as quick as it arrived.

This obviously all sound like the ramblings of a mad man (believe me I understand if you think that), but I swear on my life this was absolutely something that happened. It still stumps me, intrigues me and escapes me in terms of finding an answer. The feeling was so overwhelming that I've often doubted that I felt it at all, but having got back in touch witch Harry he assures me it was absolutely as real as he felt it.

(I have to quickly make it clear there was a third friend present who wasn't involved with the conversation and who felt nothing).

I just want to open this to questions and contemplations about what this could be/mean? Again, I'm not trying to push any religious ideology or trying to turn convert anybody to a belief. This was just a feeling I felt of overwhelming power, but clearly positive and comforting to me at the same time and I've been unsure of how to deal with it. This isn't something that clouds every thought or something that I think about every waking minute, but it is something crosses my mind from time to time and I think ''hmm, that was strange''.

I've typed enough...What do you think?",1

My father passed away two weeks back from sudden, silent heart failure. This came as the biggest shock in all our lives. Me, my brother, my mom. We are still not able to absorb this. We look at his photo, and we still can’t believe something like this has happened.

We all slept on a happy note the night before. And in fact, after a long time, we all were so happy, sharing our day’s happenings to one another. We have since then, been remembering his memories.

&#x200B;

I do daily meditations and read a lot of stuff on spirituality, including death; and that we all are mortal, and that we all will be dead on day, was like something that I thought, I was prepared for. If something unfortunate does happen, I will be able to accept it immediately and then move on easily. But my father’s death brought about a lot of realisations in me. This life is so fragile?!! He always stood as a pillar in our lives. It was like – no matter what happened, there was somebody who won’t let anything happen to us. Now that he is no more, we are feeling like we have been left all alone in this this vast world! It’s as if we have lost the roof above us, that protected us!

&#x200B;

Is this life so fragile?! I am still wondering. Somebody who had so many dreams, can go in just two hours, leaving everybody else behind?!!

&#x200B;

Why do we keep running behind all materialistic things all our life? Is this all there is to life? I have been able to see life more deeply and closely now. I feel like responding more consciously to people around. 

One person who is present today, we may not be able to see him tomorrow! I have seen him cremated before my eyes. Somebody who was all well and active, can become ashes in mere 6-7 hours?

&#x200B;

It's hard to believe even now, but I think this is life. I read this quote by Sadh-guru long back, but I think it’s now that I understand it more deeply: “When you face mortality, suddenly your intelligence starts working beyond the tyranny of social conditioning.”

1699515717.0,Simulation Theory is taking the metaphor too literally,"Are you able to discern the difference between a dream and the waking world? Sure the surreality of your dreams or worst nightmares from a limited subjective perspective given an actuality into the world we all share may inspire a dreamlike surreality uncanny atmosphere that makes mundane moments seem poetic and given impossible amount of importance.

I have suspected that misinformation is fed to examine from a sociological level it’s spread digestion and acceptance as truth to a discernible level to the average citizen for the security of the fate of mankind and not its downfall when it’s safest and before it is absolutely vital to have mastered the almost impossible task of pursuing an objective standard while only being able to perceive your own subjective point of view.

In a dream you are clouded with a narrow realm of thought and perspective so much so it’s unlikely you are aware at the time that life does not add up to coherence beyond a sort of visceral or symbolic metaphorical experience that pushes a sort of deeper truth into your gut that you can’t shake off once your waking self is aware that in the dream world there is absolutely no sense of continued narrative experienced linearly with a few fade to blacks for sleepy time. There is so much more detail and critcal thought and fullness in reality than the place where the metaphor is the message but not the existence that exits within the world outside our physical bodies and minds that we sense and even feel and even intuit or use a kind of God given sixth sense.

Everything is an influence on its immediate surroundings as Newton said every action has an equal reaction either physical spiritual or through karma across the universe bending reality to its influence. It almost seems as if we’re slaves to the first uncaused cause or the prime mover or the unmoved mover, as the domino theory or butterfly effect would articulate but we choose how we communicate or utilize or redirect that energy that can not be destroyed but pointed. To me free will is fundamental and sometimes in the best case scenario is the highest hope that a divine power could trace or your acceptance and choice and objective succeess at least chasing an impossible expectation. At least that is what I hope. To me to will happiness and joy and fullness of life to those that love you truly and not with false pretenses but with the true hard reality of true love is not chains but an enjoyment and a learning experience.

To go a little deeper into some of my esoteric thoughts. Dark matter is the physical weight of spiritual invisible God, and it our belief and our virtues that strengthen him in an almost all powerful but objectively more than we could ever grasp. 

Whatever is behind this universe that kind of crafted this one is not Windows 95 but some fundamental force like chaos that willed its existence from complete nothingness that some intelligent design from pure accident of uninfluenced randomness experienced a glimpse of a song or melody so beautiful it gave purpose to all that sufffering that is fundamentally more likely in complete chaos than a perfectly tuned universe. That reality is not more real than the reality we exist in but must be at the very least in a much emptier space where the fundamental powers take complete focus to control and is more like wind or electricity or cosmic fog.

1699454159.0,Death Is a Process of Disintegration,"Many existentialists focus on death, and many view it as the ultimate harm. But just what is death? When we use that word, it’s not the biological death of the body that we tend to focus on, but the threat of the dissolution of the self, which, not coincidentally, is the center of value. The self is the I, the subject of experience and the agent of action. It is the embodied I that experiences and shapes the environment. 

Death is the process by which the self disintegrates. We spend a lifetime developing skills, achieving a social status, acquiring objects, interacting with others, experiencing sensations and explaining them through concepts. We create a map of the world through this throughout our lives. 

Death unravels our being in the world by disintegrating us, the self. The capacity to move diminishes. Nerve conduction speeds slow, and along with them, the speed of thought, and other physical capacities. Bones become brittle and eventually break. The immune system declines, opening the way to opportunistic infections. Long-standing threats gain a foothold through increasing vulnerabilities. Various disabilities and illnesses compound. 

Eyesight and the acuity of hearing diminish. Our appearance changes. People don’t want to be around us as much. We become cognitively inflexible and repetitive. If we live long enough, we become so impaired as to be unrecognizable, and so many others we knew will have died by then that the world will seem foreign, cold, and frightening, in any case—a world that has moved on without us, in which we exist increasingly as an historical relic and stranger, and one eager to be rid of us to make way for the new, the replacements. 

A lifetime of thinking about the value and meaning of life comes to naught. One’s focus shifts to surviving another day without crippling pain and labored breathing. There will be no final vacation. It’s too late for that. Money can no longer buy the things we desire most: health and time. We know that there is no way out for us, and wonder if some philosophers and neuroscientists were right, after all, that the self is an illusion created by temporarily integrated subsystems of the brain and the rest of the body. 

At some point, the damage accrued to the body, up until now a set of small fractures, breaks precipitously into a crack in the dam of the body. There is very little time now, and no escape. The disintegration of bodily borders is imminent. 

Panic erupts. The borders of the self have been breached. We break out in a cold sweat as we feel chest pain that we know signals a fatal heart attack. Every bodily behavior now, both autonomous and voluntarily, is focused on survival. The external world recedes completely, replaced by the sensation of our growingly erratic heartbeat. 

Our legs have grown numb. We can no longer feel them. Our skin has turned to ice. Attempting to breathe brings a stabbing pain. The lights overhead seem to tremble as dizziness confuses our perceptions. And then, nothing. No awareness. We have disappeared, even if the body continues its unstoppable journey down a mountain at frightening speed for a while longer. 

It is at this point that neither reason nor religion can inform the living where (if anywhere) the departed has gone. Whether to an afterlife or extinction—of course, we’re convinced of the latter—we cannot know. We instinctively recoil at the sight of a dead body and retreat, backward, out of the death room, into warmth and light, our values, the comfort of others, the busyness of preparations to make, and the rush of life that embraces us in its current and propels us inexorably forward. Just as the torch of one life is extinguished, it burns brightly in other selves, as the cycle of life renews itself, aware of the echoes of its history, but too titillated by the dreams of its future to listen too closely to them. 

Be here now. Do what you love. You are both part of the canvas of life and a painter. Paint a self worthy of your highest values. And live so fully that when death finally comes to claim you, as Nikos Kazantzakis said, leave it with nothing but a burned-out castle.",1

1699410269.0,Death= time travel…,"There’s an aspect about death that really freaks me out. Basically, I don’t really know how to explain this but death is like “a time machine vehicle”.

I’ll try to explain.

When I was rying to comprehend and imagine how “forever” will feel. Someone on here said “to close your eyes and count to 1, that’s how long forever will feel”.  I’ve found this very interesting and it stuck with me. It makes sense. There’s no sense of time in death, and so wouldn’t know we’re out forever or sense any of the time passing.

So basically, what terrifies me is. For example you’re at the ER about to die go into cardiac arrest or something. All those people are there, it’s 2023. Then you go into code and die. And basically from the moment you close your eyes and enter that “eternity of nothing”, you are basically transported across decades, centuries, millenia and even trillions of years forward. All while a moment ago it was 2023 and you were at an ER room and everyone you knew was still alive.

Then a “moment” later it’s trillions of years away and there’s no humans just some very strange robotic world and everyone is dead. All in a matter of seconds as when you die and disconnect from consciousness time takes on a new form. Like for instance if someone who died 1500 years ago woke up in their grave, it wouldn’t feel to them like they were dead for 1500 years but only like they woke up straight away with no time having passed, just like surgery.

I don't often get lost in the nihilism (except when I do), but a combination of failures and poor answers around my own identity had me in a deep depression. This may come across quite dark, but I visualized what would happen if I died, and what if I was wrong?

I wanted to provide an outlet for all of the societal ills, the struggle around self-acceptance and the nihilism when I can't find my way out of my own head. This was the catalyst for Processing, a comic story that explores belief systems, identity and grief through a personal lens.

You can read it here: [https://createdbyclyde.substack.com/p/index-processing-and-other-comics](https://createdbyclyde.substack.com/p/index-processing-and-other-comics)

The story follows the death of Clyde, waking up in a place called the department of Processing - where people go when they didn't believe in anything in life. It turns out that all afterlives exist. Everywhere that people believed were real in life, do in fact, exist. The department gives Clyde a second chance to find a place of eternal bliss, since his logical brain failed him in life. As one might expect, deep thinkers like Albert Camus, Friedrich Nietzsche, Herbert Marcuse and many others were inspirations in this story and my overall world view.

A core idea of the book is that our belief systems inform not only where we go after we die, but the hierarchy we desired in life. If death is merely a continuation of those belief systems, we are doing ourselves a disservice not trying to find a state of bliss now. This project has been quite fulfilling to work on, and I spend my free time building out additional pages when I can. It has been cathartic and keeping the void at bay.

The problem with this line of thinking is that to see, be taught, or otherwise understand the nature of everything, you need the ability to perceive, and, as we all know, perception is not reality. It is our interpretation of it. So even if we existed beyond death, we would still be bound by these same limitations. 

We understand the thought experiment of my red may not be the same as your red. Perhaps my red is your blue. But regardless of whether or not we call it the same thing or perceive it differently there is an inherent essence to red that we simply cannot see. 

Red is a wavelength, energy, but by simply viewing or defining it we are obscured from its true nature. 

This is true for everything. For example,  I am a person, but each person I know perceives me differently. There is an ineffable essence to myself that not even I can know.

And so, in the end, nothing has inherent meaning, it simply is. Life is either meaningless or given meaning by you, it’s perceiver.",1

1699249447.0,I Struggle To Accept the Reality of Death and Existence,"I apologize if I'm going against the scope of this subreddit, but I noticed that a few others have come here to get advice on dealing with death anxiety and existential dread. I'm an atheist and believe that death is the end of existence, and would be the same as what it's like prior to birth. I don't like that. I enjoy what comes with being alive, i.e., emotions and the ability to learn things. My death anxiety comes from two issues, the complete loss of mental faculties and the finality of it all. For the first issue, again, I like being able to think and feel. It pains me every time to consider a scenario in which that is swiftly taken from me and never returned. What's worse is that no matter what I do to ensure longevity, death still comes. Ultimately, I am not in control of my life because I will be unable to keep it from ending. I can't handle that. I could live the healthiest lifestyle and I will still die for whatever reason. I hate thinking about it. 

There's nothing I can do and I don't think I'll ever be able to accept it happening to me. For all of the time I may have on this planet, it will never be enough. As long as I can use my mind, there will always be things I want to do, but at some point, it'll stop and I'll cease to exist. I'll be nothing. My personality, my intelligence. Every thought and feeling will just vanish and I can't prevent that. It's not fair. I don't ever want to stop existing. It just hurts and sickens me to think about it. One day, any day, I might not even feel it. It won't be black. It won't be like sleep, because people wake up from sleep. There is no waking. I can't accept this happening to me. I can't, I can't, I can't. I know that if I reach 100 years old, I will still not be ready. How can anyone be ready for this to stop? I would rather hell be real and I be the most worthy of damnation because even then my soul will still persist. If anyone can offer any advice to change my thinking, as much as I don't think I will ever get over this, it wouldn't hurt to try and overcome these feelings. ",1

I'll start: Balance and equillibrium are commonly misunderstood laws of nature. Society fails to apply it on many levels, and when caught up in the extremes, they fail to see the easily evident flaws in their practice. Some examples: Science and Sprituality, both two ends of the same stick, yet the extreme ends tend to deny each other, creating the illusion of separation. Tyranny and Anarchy. Liberalism and Conservatism. Freedom and Discipline. Kindness and Harshness. Strength and Vulnerability. Power and Weakness.

The illusion of two seperate things, that are simply two halves of one hole. Failing to implement an aspect of that thing, leads to the direct, ""cause and effect,"" consequence. A sort of yo-yo act of balancing out. Overly strict parents often lead people to overcorrect and indulge in too much freedom, and vise-versa, until we figure out equillibrium.",1

1699139533.0,"If your depressed about existentialism, here is one solution that work for me","For years and really for a large part of life, existentialism has just bugged me. It has stopped me from doing things. It makes me question my reality. Questions like ""What is the purpose of life?"" or ""Why do we exist?"" etc. The answers I've always gotten were just null. And as a result, I have never derived joy, either a null state or just sadness. It has honestly just sucked all of the joy of life away from me. It has stopped me from doing my job, posting on social media and almost stopped me from finishing my education.

But my answer to existentialism is question: Why do we ask ourself these questions?

What purpose is there to answer these questions? It has severed no purpose but to put me in a metaphorical dark corner. All these idea of meaningless life, Sci-Fi books about human existence (especially the depressing ones), existence after death, etc. they don't do anything. They are a great talking point with some people who have this view but pondering these ideas and exploring these concepts don't give comfort. At the same time, it's not something that people want to talk about because its plain depressing. After sorta embracing this answer or questioning why I even think about it just gives me comfort. EDIT: I let my chain of though do their thing and it lets me release all of that pent up anxiety and really see life in a positive light 

TLDR: If you've accepted existentialism and it's had a difficult impact on your life, my answer to existentialism is just another rewording of many others in this subreddit: Just live in the present. When it does creep up from time to time, do not think about it but just question why you even thinking about (might take some mental conditioning). Go live life and experience things for better or for worse . Stop overthinking things. Just focusing on doing things and making existence if not better for yourself but others around you.

Note: I am coming from a privilege position, (not part of the 10%) but enough to sorta just enough to have time for myself. So if your in position where you lack the time and resources for yourself, this advice won't be as helpful.",1
1699117212.0,My argument for reincarnation and why I believe it’s truly what happens after death,"Reincarnation has been a belief of mine for quite some time. Sometimes I’ll talk to people about it and it boggles my mind how many people don’t believe in it. I can see the majority of people in this sub believe nothing happens after death. Of course we’re all entitled to our own beliefs. Whether it’s reincarnation, heaven, hell, or the void. I’m going to display why I feel so positive that reincarnation is what truly happens. 

So at some point, YOU didn’t exist. You were in a state of non existence. Then, out of nowhere, you were born and came to existence. One day, you’re going to die. It could happen in 5 years, or 500 years if we have some kind of reverse aging technology. Then, you will go back to non existence. You see where I am going with this? Is it really crazy to assume that maybe, just maybe, YOU will exist again? If you want from non existence, to existence, and then back to non existence, it only makes sense that you’ll then, go back to EXISTENCE! 

Another thing people fail to realize is that if you believe in reincarnation, half of your belief already came true. Think about it for a second. You literally came to life. Reincarnation is the belief that it’s just simply going to happen again. So half of your belief has already come true. However, no one has actually been to heaven, hell, or experienced the void. So reincarnation comes the closest to actually being real because we’ve already experienced half of it. 

If you take a look at nature, everything is always on a loop. Day and night repeats itself. The weather repeats itself. The trees lose their leaves and then get them back. People die and then people are born. The Earth makes one complete rotation on its axis every 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is rounded up to 24 hours. Even though time is a made up concept. This is why I believe so strongly that we will reincarnate. If everything is on a loop, my existence to non existence and then back to existence theory makes even more sense. This existence we live in, as far as we know, is infinite! 

This next section I know I’m going to lose a lot of you. But it’s ok! I also do believe there is some sort of afterlife. Maybe a temporary place we go to so we can figure out our next journey. Maybe we really can be reborn onto other planets. Maybe I’ll be reborn as me again but in a parallel universe where I’ll get to make different decisions. Maybe we will reincarnate into higher planes of existence in bodies that are more advanced then the human body. What if humans aren’t the final form and we just think it is because we haven’t seen what’s truly out there? 

The possibilities are truly endless in this infinite universe. The only downside is we won’t actually know that we reincarnated because every life is going to feel like our first lives. But it’s always made the most sense to me. If I am correct, to the person reading this, I hope your next life is better then the one you’re living now!",1

1699076156.0,I’ve come to terms with death,"On several occasions I’ve experienced what I’d call existential panic attacks, accompanied by derealization/depersonalization (mainly induced by cannabis use) which left me feeling mortified by the thought of dying and not being able to experience life anymore. Since I was young I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, even attempting suicide at 12 years old, although up until the age of 20 I never fully comprehended what dying really meant. The first time I knew the reality of death was after taking a heroic dose of edibles. Initially I just felt tired and fell asleep but ended up waking up in the middle of the night to a deep sense of terror in the pit of my stomach when I suddenly came to the realization that someday I’d be floating in an abyss unable to tell which direction was up or down, left with the memory of my life, constrained by the laws of physics for the entirety of my existence, practically trapped in a fishbowl called Earth. In that moment I seriously felt like I was drowning underwater. I couldn’t catch my breath just thinking about how water and air are all just energy and that I would eventually “drown” in oxygen so to speak, feeling confined by the glass of the metaphorical fish tank that I would never be able to experience the depths of the universe or live to see the year 21,000 or beyond. Realistically i’d be incredibly lucky to see the depths of this planet or reach the year 2100 in my lifetime. Before that I guess I thought that I was invincible, that I would be reincarnated or go to heaven but from that moment on I knew that there was nothing beyond death. I continued experiencing similar panic attacks after that, feeling so scared of the universe itself collapsing onto me burying me deep beneath the rubble, unable to escape my pathetic excuse of an existence as a mortal human but the more the panic attacks came the braver I felt. The last time I felt like that I came to terms with how fragile life is. One day I will die and be forgotten forever, but I am alive right here and right now which Is all I will ever have so I must cherish it and keep living for as long as I can to the fullest extent the body I have been given will allow me.",1

1699036797.0,I just need a little outlet for my thoughts :D," Hey folks, M (26) here. I've had a few things swirling around in my mind for quite some time, but I've shared them with hardly anyone. I'm currently in one of those phases where I'm trying to figure out my career path. Furthermore, I've been working as a freelancer from home for a while, but recently (mid-2022), I've had some concerns about what the future holds. The constant growth of artificial intelligence, changes in the job market, increasing inflation, and so on. It seems I'm not the only one feeling this way.

In my social circle, I see many young and older people facing similar issues. What professions will still make sense in the future and which won't is yet to be seen. Nevertheless, it saddens me to think that some of the professions that make us who we are might become obsolete. I'm particularly saddened that many of the creative professions are being replaced over time.

Depression, apathy, and a significant sense of hopelessness are widespread. People seem to be growing further apart from each other. I see many lonely faces (which I also count myself among) wandering around. Friends, whether men or women, talk about their increasingly superficial and senseless “relationships” while lacking self-reflection to explain these decisions even remotely.

In addition, excessive alcohol consumption is prevalent in my environment. I don't touch a drop of alcohol when I'm home alone, but as soon as I'm out, I consume large amounts myself. All of this has somehow worn me out and brought my “motivation” or drive to a point of zero. But what would the alternative be? Should I seek a new environment with people who wallow less in their self-pity and just forget about my friends, with whom I've already been through many problems? That can't be the solution either.

But this sense of apathy has not only developed with friends. It's the same with dating. It feels like all women are just walking consumers, not seeing me as a human being, but rather as a means to achieve their own advantages. I've put dating on hold for several years now. Except for a few short-lived, unnecessary escapades, there has been no change there either.

Why bother with something that seems hopeless anyway? At least that's how it seems to me right now…

I feel somewhat empty, tired, devoid of motivation, hopeless, and have a certain sense of purposelessness within me. Everything is so meaningless these days…

The more I think about these questions, the more disconnected I feel from myself and the people around me.

1698945264.0,Life a constant stream of obligation and distraction,"Ever since I was young I’ve struggled to feel happy and at ease. When I would bring it up with my mother, her advice was always to find something to distract myself with, to keep my mind busy. I started to really resent this premise. The idea that in order to cope with life, we need to be constantly distracting ourself from the constant suffering that’s inherent in it. An existence where one needs to attempt to do the opposite of this seems far more preferable. To avoid distraction so they can revel in the goodness of what’s around them. But that doesn’t seem to be the case, at least not for me, and I get the sense this is true for most people whether they recognize it or not.

Often if you express these feelings you’re told you’re depressed, that something is not working correctly in your brain. But this feels frustratingly untrue to me. The things making me “depressed” are all true: the need to wake up earlier than your body wants to, the need to find something to eat to avoid hunger, the need to go to the bathroom, the need to endure the drudgery of work in order to not be destitute, the need to try and maintain one’s health despite it largely being out of your control, the need to constantly consider the feelings of those around you so as to not upset them, the knowing that you will inevitably upset or hurt them in some way anyway, the knowing your health and the health of your loved ones can and will be taken at some point in time which can’t be predicted, the need to try and be a moral person despite how nebulous that concept is, the list is endless. To ignore these things or be unaffected by them seems like the true delusion.

The brief moments of joyful distraction can’t change the truth that’s underneath them. It feels absurd to continue. It feels absurd to have been saddled with this despite never having had the option to opt in. (Let me note here that I’m not suicidal).

1698952915.0,Period panic from the utter meaninglessness,"Hello everyone,

As the title suggests I was wanted to discuss and ask if this happens to anyone else. I have long held my beliefs in existentialism and have used it as a tool for basing my values and experiences. From what information I have gathered, it is an extension of nihilism that states that every individual’s “purpose” or “meaning” stems from themselves and is theirs to define. I love this idea.

Unfortunately for me, this combined with my other beliefs will periodically transform into a pretty extreme feeling of anxiety. I am an atheist and I believe in nothing after death. It isn’t death I fear, but more so *change* from my current status quo. Combined with this is the realization that because we have defined our purpose ourselves, be it through internal or external factors, it seems to create a sort of mental loop for me that becomes extremely taxing over time.

As well as this, my biggest desire in life has always been to learn as much as possible and to understand the world around me. In doing so what ends up happening is the realization of how little we know and eventually the realization of the fact we will likely never know before our deaths, extending further the fact that we can never know truly anything for certain other than what we have defined. This again creates for me another sort of dread that taxes on me and increases my feelings of meaninglessness and purposelessness.

The problem only bubbles up from time to time, usually when there has been a big change or big shift that either has or is happening. The worst bits usually do not last very long, and usually just consist of “rabbit hole” deep dive into thoughts and feelings of extremely intense anxiety. I wanted to ask if anyone else here experiences similar “episodes”, for lack of a better term, and how you deal with these experiences.

Society has no intrinsic meaning, the goalpost of what is to be your cookie-cutter adult always changes, it used to be considered mature and the normal thing to do in adulthood to be a heavy or moderate smoker, now the goalpost has changed and being a smoker is seen essentially as ''selfish hedonism'' all of a sudden\[not that I am trying to encourage heavy smoking at all\]. It used to be the norm to be married and have kids at 18, now that's seen as way too young and a kick in the balls, it used to be considered honorary to enroll in the military right after grade school, now society sees it as something someone uses to compensate for the lack of a healthy posture of their self-esteem in one's self.

&#x200B;

The only things society does best at is giving you the impression of being cared and provided for, that still doesn't change the fact also this purveying can stop its circulation at any given minute, you rely on this illusion of society functioning forever so that they can grab you by the balls and domesticate your ass for nothing, almost using your reward instincts against you

&#x200B;

**Because really the main driving mechanism of society isn't so much meaning and purpose, is escapism from the hardships and inconveniences of everyday life and our mortality as a people. If it was truly purpose, why aren't we working to discover more potential out of our so called universe and solar system? Why aren't we continuing to make more ground-breaking inventions and discoveries, even if they're small?**

So it seems society even got complacent with its own ''innovation and progress'' rhetoric",1

1698809378.0,"22, Christian, and terribly afraid of death.","What’s your worldview and how do you cope with the idea of death? I believe in the Christian God, a lot of the reasoning coming from Timothy Keller’s Questioning Christianity podcast series (would recommend). He mentions this in the series, but it’s less of a solace and more of a qualm for me; I believe in the Christian God, but rationally I can’t say with 100% certainty that He is the Almighty. 

I’m 22 and, obviously/hopefully, have a lot of time left to live, but it still feels like time is slipping away at an alarmingly fast rate. I find that I have these existential dreads twice a year, sometimes they last a few months. Christmas has become a typical time for this to happen. It’s the usual, “oh it’s been a year ALREADY”. I understand that being scared of death is wasting the time I’m so afraid of losing, but often I can’t help it. 

Two main questions from this post I’d like to hear answers on…
1. If you are adamant that your view is correct (any worldview encouraged), how do you grapple with the fact that rationally you can’t be?
2. How have you/have you come to terms with the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of an afterlife? In a more mentally sound state, I would say that death is unavoidable and the afterlife is what it is and there’s nothing you can do so don’t stress but right now that is stress 😂

I’m hoping I come more to terms with it the older I get. It’s no secret society likes to pretend death doesn’t exist, do we think perhaps that has helped aid the fear of death. Back when death was common (dark ages for example/anytime before the last 150 years), were people more accepting of it/welcoming towards it?",1

1698526393.0,"If you are afraid of death, understand that 5 year old you is already dead","If you are afraid of death read this.  A common response to all the posts here about fearing death is ""don't worry about death, it will be like it was before you were born.""  But this doesn't really resonate with a lot of people.  We don't know what that was like and can't really relate.

Perhaps easier to understand is that 5 year old you is already dead.  After all what are we?  If we are our bodies, know that your cells turnover regularly, so the body you have now is 100% different from the one 5 year old you had.  If we are our memories, well, your bank of memories when you were 5 was a whole lot different than they are now.  You remembered lots of things then that you don't now and vice versa. If we are our personalities then I'm sure your personality is extremely different from what it was when you were 5.  For the most part you would react completely differently to the same scenarios now as you would then.

So where is that 5 year old you now?  That particular combination of cells, memories, habits, personality traits, etc?  They are nowhere.  They are gone forever, never to return.  They are dead.  Sure, the current you, who is in almost all respects a completely different person, may have some memories of what 5 year old you did.  But that's not all that different from when you will die, and the people around you will retain memories of your actions for quite some time.

&#x200B;

Are you worried about 5 year old you?  Are they suffering?  Is there a great light of consciousness they had that is now snuffed out?  Are you grieving their untimely demise?

&#x200B;

Not only is 5 year old you dead.  1 year ago you is dead.  1 month ago you is dead.  Yesterday's you is dead.  1 minute ago you is dead.  The you that exists now is about to die.  Never to return.  Death is the most familiar thing in the world.  What death will feel like for you is what tomorrow will feel like for the you that is reading this.

1698526030.0,On Kierkegaard's 'Fear and Trembling',"Kierkegaard's 'Fear and Trembling' seems to revolve around the following concepts:

&#x200B;

* **The absurd** 

 Is he referring to the absurd of Camus? 

The fact that Kierkegaard adds 'faith' into this relationship, confuses me. 

&#x200B;

* **The movement**

Is he referring to a leap of faith?

He mentions how the Knight of Faith jumps. He jumps from the physical world, in the leap he is with God?, and then he goes back to the physical world to which you can tell he doesn't belong to it, because he waves. Can someone elaborate on this?

&#x200B;

* **Resignation, in the contexts of faith vs no faith** 

He puts the example of a regular man who falls in love with a princess. He then exposes how different are the mental models and hence the inner emotional experience of the Knight of Faith vs. The Knight of Resignation.

&#x200B;

* **The Knight of Faith vs The Knight of Resignation** 

Would the latter be a man like Camus, and the first someone like Abraham?

&#x200B;

* **Infinitude and finitude** 

He seems to mix this adjectives in an inverse way? 

He refers to infinite pain even for that who has faith, even though then he goes and says faith will give him back that which he resigned himself in? For instance, in that romantic story of the princess and regular man?

Any supportive documentation you can recommend to get to the depths of Kierkegaard's thinking will be much appreciated.

1698470038.0,Fear to be everything,"I've had an hallucinating thought and it won't let me sleep.  
I was thinking about what is after death. Scientifically, the mind dies with the brain, so there should be 'nothingness'. But 'nothingness' is a meaningless concept, as if I am still live, but in a 'place' called nothing, dark and black.  
WHO experiences nothingness? So, I asked myself, what ends with me? Just a collection of memories accumulated over the years. But the universe is always there. So I thought: when I die I will stop being me, but I will still be OTHERS.  
The logical consequence of this is that I'm ALREADY the others.

I am everyone who exists at this moment.  
I'm four billion men and 3.95 billion women, and 20 quintillion of animals, excluding the possibility of other life in the universe. I'm everyone who feels pleasure and everyone who suffers now, and also everyone who feels nothing in particular. I'm having sex with all the most beautiful women in the world, and also with some of the ugliest. And also with all the men. And the animals. I'm eating all edible foods. I'm dying, I'm being born, I'm the doctor and the sick, the murderer and the murdered, the executor and the executed, the rapist and the raped. I'm the hundreds of people suffering and dying right now in Gaza and Ukraine. I'm Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. I'm Donanld Trump and Joe Biden. I'm a bird in a cage.  
I'm you.  
You are me.  
We are everything.

Now, why is this thought so frightening? Remember Schopenhauer's old argument: ""who suffers more, the one who eats or the one who's eaten?"" Pain infinitely outweighs pleasure. What does it matter that I'm having 300,000 simultaneous orgasms if I'm suffering even the most horrific pains? You can simply read crime news right now to distress yourself. In every moments mourning, terror, nightmares, torture, rape and chilling things beyond the capacity of imagination. You can't say, ""luckily it didn't happen to me."" In fact, it happened to you. It's happening NOW, while you feel safe in your room.

I would like my comfortable eternal oblivion back. Nothing, no thought, no feeling, no boredom. All solved. I will no longer be able to suffer.  
But if I am everything, then my suffering will be infinite. Sure, sooner or later life on earth will die out. But there may be other species in the universe. Sure, sooner or later the universe will die too. At that point, no conscience, no suffering. And yet ours may be only one of an infinite number of universes, like bubbles in the immeasurable ocean of quantum probability.  
Then every possible suffering, even those that are physically unthinkable in our world, will be realised. Forever. The universe would be something truly similar to the christian hell. And there would be no escape.

All this is too overpowering for me. I am looking for thoughts that will put me outside this maze, but at the moment I cannot find any.",1

1698451121.0,I spilled my thoughts and feelings in a lengthy piece. Curious to hear what you think about it.,"I contemplate a sense of superiority, though often labeled as egocentric, akin to a god. This doesn't negate my belief that we are all gods, creators of our unique worlds and individual lives. Describing myself as superior was an exaggeration; I am awake when society slumbers. Fortunately, not everyone embodies this perspective entirely, yet regrettably, the majority falls short. This is a pivotal aspect that demands transformation—a mere matter of opening our eyes. I don't claim superiority; rather, I'm disheartened by humanity's evolution.

Concurrently, an immense hope propels my endeavors toward a positive transformation. It's akin to escaping a prison cell; mentally, I acknowledge the escape, but I find myself within the confines of another dilemma. It's a ramble, I admit.

To derive mental well-being and decisions externally results in an unfulfilled life. I assert that the power lies within us, accidents notwithstanding. Generally, individuals spend their lives lamenting missed opportunities or comparing themselves to others. A death characterized by fear and regrets, rather than the intended outcome—a demise filled with pride and joy upon reaching life's conclusion.

Even if our goals remain unmet, persistently striving towards them is sufficient for a content departure. That, I posit, encapsulates the essence. Apologies attributing interference to others, even externally altering circumstances, are mere pretexts. Primarily, these individuals grapple with personal issues and haven't grasped the concept of a fulfilled, content demise.

We should not compromise our worldview. Perseverance instills a mindset geared towards pursuing dreams. Perhaps, albeit unlikely, society may collectively evolve through the dissemination of such knowledge across generations. Alarming suicide statistics, particularly among the youth, underscore the generational damage inflicted on society. It's disheartening that someone so young may contemplate opting out.

Meanwhile, others seek external validations for a sense of accomplishment. Criticism is directed at those who choose to depart, deeming it weak and absurd. However, the departed are justified, worn out by diminishing collective hope for societal enlightenment.

Finding strength amid passing generations, burdened by parental expectations, is increasingly challenging. The collective march towards mental hibernation mirrors a zombie-like state, potentially leading to humanity's demise.

In this delicate situation, I feel broken. Yet, a sudden hope propels me forward. Despite humanity's self-destructive tendencies, I commit to sharing my knowledge. It's akin to planting a family tree; if not initiated, it doesn't exist. Embracing one's beliefs is imperative; otherwise, belief remains superficial. Being is a journey; working towards becoming is intrinsic.

This notion varies for each individual. If pursuits are self-fulfilling and non-detrimental to society and others, external opinions become inconsequential. The challenge lies in determining what is truly beneficial for society—an introspective process questioning fundamental beliefs devoid of external influences.

Clearing our minds of external clutter, questioning ourselves, and embracing life, dreams, and non-harmful endeavors are paramount. Wishing for a collective embrace of such principles is essential. Stepping over others is not the path; rather, cherishing life in all its facets, good and bad, is the key.

This philosophy must echo through future generations, offering hope that time will bring positive changes. It commences with someone, with us, envisioning a future that enriches both our internal selves and society in the long run.

I maintain optimism in the possibility of such a future. Dreaming and striving come at no cost. Turning our backs on these aspirations is not an option. We are capable of overcoming challenges and fostering positive change.",1

1698322803.0,The hiveminds surrounding us.,"I recently read a social psych book called 
“The Hiveminds”. It was an interesting book about the nature of culture and its entity like nature. It had me pondering a question of which came first knowledge or the man. I mean there is no disputing that the laws of nature existed before man and so why would any other knowledge be different? So where are we pulling knowledge from? Well I would say it is not located in the physical realm so some metaphysical space that we can barely describe let alone measure. Now once we start to break down these domains of knowledge it starts to feel similar to a culture or Hivemind. It’s an entity like presence and lives beyond the limits of human perseption. Consider the Greeks or any ancient civilization and the large spectrum of gods. Each god representing a tree of knowledge for example Ares being the god of war. It’s away for people to conceptualize a collection of concepts. I have never been a “religious individual” as defined by current surrounding hivemind… but I strongly believe that spirituality has its place the hierarchy of needs. I see this in America in a lot of ways. People don’t have this need met in their hierarchy chain and with a culture based on individualism and isolationism they branch into uncharted territory of hiveminds and often leading to mental distress especially people who have a poor mental construct. Personally my experiences with religion had not filled this spiritual need as they always become a spiritual token board again just in my experience. As an analytical minded person I needed something more tangible. I am trying to shift my perspective to this way of understanding the hiveminds in which to follow.  Finding the hivemind, whose concepts are intended for the betterment of the world around me is my way of reaching spiritual enlightenment.

And what's with not just the universe creating these conscious things (us) but also imbuing them with some kind of innate desire for meaning and purpose when (if) there is none?

but, I have only met one who was similar to my self, who walked with me, camped with me, who would speak deeply with me and who would train with me.

He would even repeat ""iron sharpens iron"".

Then, soon after, he died.

I meet others who are somewhat similar... but there's always something way off with their discipline. They curse a lot or are unwilling to practice disciplines, they love money, etc.

I have always been okay with solitude and my lonesome self.

but, in the last year, I have become a little disturbed at the fact that, even if I wanted to speak with someone in even a 'somewhat' relatable way... there is no one.

For my companion to die is.... beyond words for me.

I feel that I am living in a world of darkness.

I find light within. I do find peace and freedom, and the birds are kind and deer and even bear that I encounter are all gentle and kind.

but, people.... are like... machines...

they're all dedicated to money. No one climbs trees. No one wants to work together toward anything.

Males I speak to are all addicted to lusting after girls.

I can not find tribe or spiritual family.

I am beginning to feel disturbed from this.

not expecting to find some miraculous answer on here but... just curious if anyone has anything to say in regards to what i've shared....",1

1698180287.0,Metaphysical and Existential Nihilism,"In Moby Dick as Philosophy (2015), Mark Anderson distinguishes between metaphysical nihilism and existential, or psychological nihilism. He explains the difference like this. ""[Metaphysical nihilism] amounts in brief to the rejection of belief in any metaphysical reality or truth. The second, which we may refer to as 'existential nihilism,' is the psychological condition of despair or depression resulting from the assumption that if there is no metaphysical truth, then the world is valueless and life is not worth living. Nietzsche approves of the first type of nihilism, metaphysical nihilism, and we may, I believe, fairly label him a nihilist in this sense of the word. Of the second type of nihilism, existential nihilism, Nietzsche vehemently disapproves, and he struggled to resist it himself"" (253). 

Because our culture has been implicitly built upon the idea of a God who provide the foundation for meaning, truth, and beauty, our recent turn towards secularism and atheism has left us vulnerable to what has been described on this subreddit again and again: a groundlessness, a lack of meaning or purpose, a complete futility in the face of what amounts to a pointless death. Even the faith we put in science has the same echoes of a belief in God. And we realize that not even a study of the natural world can shore up our eroding beliefs. Only now, says Nietszche, are we beginning to reckon with the death of God and what that means for our relationships and projects. We have built our house upon the sand of God, and our house is beginning to wash away. 

But the despair and nihilism I see on this subreddit is not existentialism, as I understand it. In fact, it may in fact be in implicit agreement with something like its opposite, perhaps scholasticism, which would maintain that if there is no God and therefore no ultimate meaning, then it must follow that my personal life is also meaningless. 

Existentialism maintains that metaphysical nihilism does not necessitate existential nihilism. The project of existentialism is to overcome nihilism (Nietzsche); to face our death, the impossibility of any further possibility, with resoluteness (Heidegger); to courageously confront and appropriate as much non-being as we are able (Tillich). 

This is my small attempt to remind myself of one of the essential moods of existentialism: a joyful Dionysian laughter, even while understanding that it would have been better to never have been born.",1
1698113748.0,I personally don’t think you’re able to unexist.,"Personally, knowing Einstein said energy can neither be created or destroyed only transformed, that alone leads me to believe that we go on in some form. Just not the current form. Since energy cannot cease to exist neither can you or me but we will however change form. Energy can never just zap out of existence the way atheists claim. It’s literally impossible for you to not exist after existing. Knowing that Einstein was right, knowing that we’re atoms essentially at our core (which is still energy) the question isn’t whether we go on or not, but what do we go into becoming? Just an idea to play around with. I do not speak in absolute on subjects no human being can give a confident answer to. You can confidently believe whatever you want . Whether there is an afterlife or not the living will never know, but we will all die, and when do we ALL will find out whether what we believed on earth was true or not. The unfortunate part is we have to die in order to find out.


Edit: I think laws of physics have been proven by those UAP’s to have laws we have yet to discover. A species that can’t figure out how objects can travel from 80,000 FT to sea-level in less than 5 seconds has no business confidently telling anyone anything about laws or life after death. We don’t know shit, we just like to think we do. There are obviously methods of propulsion that go beyond our understanding. Humans need to work on humility, instead of us acting like we have everything figured out. We can’t even travel the universe comfortably for fucks sake.

1698068840.0,Is the perceived separation of humanity and nature why we feel dread of death?,"I believe that we are part of nature and everything around us even cities and other man-made structures are also nature. They might have taken different forms because of our manipulation of nature but it is still evident. Our minds crave categorization of the natural world and have thus divided 'our world' from nature. Humanity viewing itself as destroying nature is simply nature moving in a direction that we can subjectively judge as 'bad'. Given that many of us can't do anything about the rapid loss of natural resources, we project a myriad of self-hate to ourselves which can manifest to   
 a fear of dying and I am no exception.

(I have no qualms with people who fight and advocate for eco-friendly living and am not blaming anyone for feeling an obligation to conserve the natural world)

I'd like to add that this feeling of angst is likely to have been prevalent even back in the purest agrarian societies but is far more present in modern times due to population growth and this perceived loss of the natural world. Nature, as we are a part of it, is a cyclical process that has no end goal aside from flux. Living and dying are human concepts that do not matter to nature. 

I think we can live more fulfilling lives by internalizing that our very being is nature moving about in space and time on Earth. We are both living and dying just as the Earth is. One day the Earth's core will cool but energy remains. We remain and are distributed.

Hume is right to point out that, through introspection, one *cannot* find any part of their soul/identity that is apart from an experience. In other words, *we* are merely lumps of experience.

Therefor free will is impossible according to science. He also pointed out that neurological studies show we unconsciously make decisions before we can rationalize our choices.

I’ve struggled with these issues since I was 6 years old, and now, at 17, they have become overwhelming. While I understand that death is a natural part of life, the idea of not existing terrifies me.

Most people offer the perspective that death is ‘like life before you were born,’ but that analogy doesn’t resonate with me. Before I was born, I hadn’t built relationships, formed memories, or developed an appreciation for life. Therefore, the idea of reverting to that state is deeply unsettling.

Although I identify as an atheist, a part of me hopes for an afterlife where I can reunite with loved ones. The thought that death might mean the end of my existence—and that my life’s actions would then be meaningless—disturbs me greatly.

Adding to the complexity, my mental health struggles, including ADHD and possibly depression and BPD, make these fears even more debilitating. I feel trapped in a state of emotional limbo. I want to seek professional help, but I can’t afford therapy and don’t feel I can discuss this with my parents.

1697507487.0,"On Consciousness, God, and the Subjectivity of Truth: Do We Really Know?","Consciousness is seemingly nothing inherently, as one cannot think outside oneself in a universe that operates without the influence of one's own mind. The universe, perhaps governed by a God, exists and operates by its own laws, regardless of whether we're aware of it or not. If consciousness doesn't influence how the universe operates, what is its purpose or value?

On the topic of God and belief, believing in Him provides a source of spiritual companionship through hard times. One could say that His presence can be a constant guiding force. When our paths feel solitary from a human perspective, there might be a divine presence offering guidance, comfort, and strength in a way that the human mind cannot comprehend. The nonbelievers of the world may say that God doesn’t exist because there’s no proof of him existing, which is valid. But just as there's no proof of God, there's also no proof that he doesn’t exist at all.

With these reflections on consciousness and God, I'm drawn to think about truth. If consciousness has no inherent universal function, then perhaps its value is subjective or intrinsic, which means that each person’s “truth” is subjective. If everyone’s truth is subjective, there is no objective truth or reality, unless one believes the teachings of religious texts and claims them as objective truth.

Lastly, there's the existential question of what comes after life. We’ll never know till we die. And even then, if death is nothingness, we wouldn’t know that we died. It's akin to sleep; it’s sudden, and then we wake up like nothing ever happened. Any thoughts?",1

I can accept that I will die, it’s a natural part of life, of course. I have also heard that the body is literally built to make death comfortable so I know that pain won’t be completely painful. But what I cannot accept is absolute nothingness and reincarnation. 

I love the life I have now, the people I have in it and all of my experiences. I cherish everyone in my life and everything I have gone through. I don’t want to forget all my loved ones and everything I’ve been through. I also do not want to reincarnate because then that would mean I wouldn’t have the memories I have with my sister, my mom, and everyone else I love. 

If Heaven is real, I pray to God that I see my loved ones. If the soul is real, I hope my soul will be with all my loved ones, that I can continue to be with them and they remember. I hope that when this life ends, I do not reincarnate. I am happy with the memories I’ve made and the people I’ve met. 

Does anyone have any experiences they can share or any tips on how to decrease this anxiety? It’s been taking over my daily life so much.",1

1697455462.0,Kierkegaard for gloomy aesthetes,"*What kind of life is yours; do you will one thing, and what is this one thing?*

- Søren Kierkegaard

Many of the root problems for people engaging with existentialism revolve around the meaninglessness of existence due to the ""death-deadline"", i.e., the eventual endpoint in which our efforts take on a celebrated and recognised essence which we can enjoy others enjoying. While rightly terrifying, there is something in an obscure book by S. K. that people should turn to for a few reasons: not only to understand S. K.'s understanding of valorisation, but also to read people like Harry Frankfurt and Albert Camus *correctly*.

In *Purity of Heart*, Kierkegaard covers the idea of what it means to live (as Frankfurt put it) ""wholeheartedly"". When we desire one thing and one thing alone, the world is unified in an ethical worldview that we can navigate. For the depressed aesthete, this might seem like mockery, but there is an important lesson for everyone here: the purity of heart asks us to turn away from aesthetic essentialism and to become existential.

What does that mean?

When we are essentialist in our pursuit of meaning, we will turn the ""meaningfulness"" out into the world in objects that we can interact with. Much like ""A"" in *Either/Or*, all this effort and search for meaning is justified *only if* it can help us avoid boredom. But if you are at the point of entering S. K.'s ""ethical stage"" (i.e., you no longer recognise simple joy or achievement or even things like spite as meaningful *an sich*), then this fails. Why am I doing this if I will eventually no longer be able to appreciate it?

At this point, our understanding of self extends about the point where we are an individual which exists at various points in time. Can we guess why this is terrifying yet?

The purity of heart requires us to recalibrate our way of thinking from ""the avoidance of boredom"" to ""the joy of ongoingness"". We are existing beings, we are existential; we exist in time and should find the pursuit of the ""one thing"" joyful in-itself. By creating barriers about what we will not do (""the ethical"" for Kierkegaard, ""the unspeakable"" for Frankfurt), we open up the freedom to resist the pressure of the outside world. Our passion opens us up to successes and failures which we take on in the spirit of ""ongoingness"" - the pursuit itself, careful and methodical, is what brings value to our lives.

This is where we find Camus' famous ""one must imagine Sisyphus happy"" - the happiness is not a mindless surrender to our throwness, but finding value within a worldview that is existential: what we do is worth doing in pursuit of the *telos*.

But what if I build the wrong worldview?

Obviously, S. K. had a particular worldview in mind: passionate faith in Christ. He saw this as the best way to achieve what he was discussing. But this wasn't the only framework he presented.

In *A Literary Review*, he presented the 1848 revolutionaries as equally eligible for the ""religious sphere"" of life. This was because these individuals were driven by the purity of heart: what is must end and something new must be created. They were driven, ideologically individualist within a collective network, and effective on the backdrop of a worldview which they wanted to grab by the throat. In that way, we can see clearly that S. K.'s ideas aren't theological *per se*.

In moving towards ""wholeheartedness"", we must be willing to *be* existential. That means, in a funny sort of way, a scientific approach to ethics: we must recognise and accept the values we have inhereted (thrownness), but we must move towards the purity of heart by gaining and discarding ethical principles that we cannot reconcile with our *telos*. The meaning in life comes from recognising what is already meaningful and driving towards a concrete inward-outward expression of the meaningful in the ethical expression of the life of the individual. This involves choosing to ""transcend"" ourselves and the world around us in an effort to become more.

This, of course, sounds dangerously close to ""create your own meaning, find your purpose"" self-help vulgar Sartreanism. But it isn't: the meaning comes in grasping what we are without deception and chasing after the *telos* through careful and methodical ongoingness. Recognising that the existential meaning of life comes in the existential expression of the individual, not a concrete essential object that we put into the world. Reject vulgar essentialism, embrace the inward-outward agreement of the essential and the existential through effort itself.

*Here I stand, I can do no other, so help me God.*

1697406059.0,Do We Truly Understand Existentialist Philosophy?,"Hey there, fellow deep thinkers,

Existentialism, with its profound philosophical roots, has always fascinated me. Yet, as I scroll through this subreddit, a question keeps nagging at me: Are we losing the core essence of existentialism? It appears that we’ve drifted into a space where venting and sharing depressive thoughts often overshadow the philosophical exploration.

Don’t get me wrong; providing emotional support is essential. However, existentialism is more than just a platform to vent. It’s about the exploration of profound ideas that tackle the human condition. 

I’m raising these questions not to criticize but out of genuine curiosity. It’s not merely about invoking the names of Sartre, Camus, or Kierkegaard, but immersing ourselves in their writings to comprehend the profound ideas they put forth. I wonder if some of us are more inclined to use this subreddit as an outlet for venting and sharing our existential struggles, which is vital in its own right. But let’s not forget the rich philosophical roots from which existentialism grew. Perhaps it’s time for all of us to take a step back, revisit these primary sources, and engage in more philosophical conversations to ensure that existentialism remains at the heart of our discussions.

I’d love to hear your thoughts.",1

Reading some socrates, even though im not into philosophy, really helped with my panic attacks. Ive heard people say that people get into existential depression through logic, and leave through sentimentalism. This saying made me really depressed, because it suggests that it is logical to suffer, and we can only escape suffering through ignoring logic.

I want to know some more logical views on escaping existential depression. I feel like hearing how other's use sound arguments to overcome their fear of death will help me a lot, and i will be forever grateful.  Btw, if you have something to say about how there is no way to escape it through logic, or anything remotely pessimistic, i ask you not to reply with it. Not that your opinion is any less valid, just that it will make me feel really shitty.

After a couple of years of great suffering and working 9 to 6 - which may be the same thing -,I learnt about The Myth of Sisyphus and ended up reading Camus, then Kierkegaard, then Nietzsche and so on. Also Emerson, Thoreau and some Eastern wisdom.

A good analogy to explain my experience would be a cinema. You are in the cinema, carefully designed to prime you to get immersed in the experience. As you are watching the movie, you forget the characters are actors and that you are in the cinema. It feels so real, so intense.

I, myself, see myself in the cinema, I see the cinema and then I see the cinema within the cinema. And it all seems absurd to me even though I can see how deeply it all matters at the same time.

All the suffering out there, all the love. It is like a game but with very serious consequences and I just didn't choose to come here.

Take love. I fell in love, felt I would always be with that person, ended up breaking up with them or being dumped. I look back and I see all the promises made, all the I love yous and We will always be together. Bullshit. The love of your life today is a stranger tomorrow.

I just can't get myself to experience this world like I did before, in emotional terms. I am at a point where I go from a place where I am truly suffering - I have clinical depression - and want to die, to a place where I am calm in my despair and calmly think 'Fuck, I hope I don't wake up tomorrow'.

I really think love and art are the two things that give meaning to life. It seems quite obvious that we need love and connection to thrive and survive, but after what I've seen and the new way I look at this, I just can't.

I have been having such bad anxiety about EVERYTHING. I’ve read posts and articles on existential anxiety, depersonalization, depression, antenatal anxiety. i’ve tried to find different coping tactics but nothing is working. I feel like i’m terrified of the fact i’m alive and that one day i won’t be. I’m terrified of growing older, terrified to live life, terrified of time, not feeling connected to anything. at the beginning of this pregnancy i had to put down two of my life long dogs, and i think that’s where the thought of death sparked and i have been in a downward spiral since. I’m terrified of losing my grandparents, my parents, my siblings, my fiancé. I’m terrified that i’m giving my child life & that time will fly by. i’m terrified that one day she will have to experience this. 
It’s gotten to the point where i literally cannot function. the second i wake up it’s on my mind all day long. it causes severe anxiety attacks, where my chest hurts and i can’t breathe, feeling like i’m going to cry, then realizing none of this matters because one day i won’t be here. I currently am a dispatcher, and since we are short staffed and have lack of calls my shifts require me to sit in a small room by myself for 10 hours. With almost nothing to do, my mind just started to wonder. It wonders to the point i have extreme anxiety and these meltdowns in my head. i try watching tv to distract myself. 
i ended up turning in my two weeks a few days ago. I talked with my supervisors and they are putting me in touch with counselors through my job. everyone is being so supportive that i don’t want to leave my job because of the people, but i don’t know how i can force myself to go to work and sit by myself for 10 hours in a small confined room. it’s not like i can walk away from the phone and computer in case of emergency, i can’t go for a walk or get any exercise. 
I start to panic about how it is affecting my baby. I don’t know what else to do. I’m so scared of living life and not getting everything i want out of it, but then i struggling with what do i want out of life? I don’t want to die, but i kind of wish i didn’t exist.
I’ve been praying and trying to reconnect with God to get me through this. Its very discouraging that i have been seeking professional help and i have been disregarded. My first counselor canceled all three of my appointments because she called off work. I told my OB i needed to talk to someone and they never referred me.

Metaphysicians and theologians alike pretend to solve the constricting discomfort that this fact creates by sneaking in objective meaning or divinity to be worshipped (both are the same thing wearing different masks) through cracks of thought. But as children come to learn, all sandcastles fade away. Scratch into cliff walls all the scribbles you want; the bare stone faces do not care. And just as soon as the scribe dies, bludgeoned to death by his very own writing-stone, his enemy picks it up and writes blasphemy. Blasphemy is law, though. But there is a truth far more tragic than the goodness and life created by enemies: Forgetfulness. Nay, more: Irrelevance. The enemies, who were truly the greatest of friends, are stone-scratches themselves. Impersonal wind and air smudge their lives into obscurity. Unconnected and uncaring to the feuds and glories of the past, someone equally obscure finds the writing-stone. She sees the cliff. She walks on. Where did the meaning go! The Scripture! In what vase does it lie? Everything is created and destroyed.

You are withering. Look at your hand! You may be young, a bright blooming flower. Yet we also know this: When there are brilliantly bright flames, it is precisely the time they are dying the quickest. We are not fooled. Yes, we are all old. Incredibly old. Dying. Our world, parallel to and created within us, dies too. All the thinkers pretend. They cannot cope with the fact that their meanings and morals and wonderful conjectures are more like tattoos they drew on themselves, not part of the biology of the universe. When all that beautiful thought withers away, how good will it be for us? No good. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. There is no one for it to be good for. Arrows shot, but there never was a target.

Arrows shot. Arrows shot! Despair is certain. Pain— objectively certain. Death— metaphysically certain. But aren’t we describing the athlete? She labors and endures in her race, on and on, pushing and fighting, and she meets a mark. She created this mark. She goes again, the goal is raised. Dutiful suffering, and she fails. She goes again. Failure. Again. Many failures. But somehow, there is marginal improvement. Suffering ensues, and she makes it! Success! The mark is raised. This process repeats until she can no longer run. Is she in despair? Maybe— surely every now and then, for she is human. Pain? A reliable enemy and friend. But there is a mystery, a glimmering curiosity in the sea of futility: She is satisfied. She rebelled. An absurd respect is adorned over her neck; the golden medal that she forged.

Philosophies wither, and God fades, yet the pinkness in the clover lasts only for a beautiful instant— so do not miss it! And why would you walk away from this wonderful playing field; this wonderful deathbed? You might encourage others to be blind to temporal excellence; such a deed may be the only immorality.

1697193075.0,My 22 year old existentialism on a Friday afternoon,"What percentage are we animals? We enjoy masquerading that we are beyond a point where we could be called fauna. We have a notion that we are more than simply living. As such, we train cats and dogs, send hamsters to run circles in cages and over-feed our pet fishes.

When I was a kid my family got a dog. We never took good care of it. Didn't walk it enough, never gave it enough attention and then mourned its death when it died at 8 years old. Ironic, isn't it? That I have the audacity to question why we find ourselves on a pedestal above our pets when I had such little respect for my own dog growing up. That dog must have had such a miserable life. Maybe I never opened my heart up to him because he was extra work. He was something that demanded attention and I understood at a young age that attention was a precious resource. That I could gain instant gratification food and games. My basic instinct was to gain attention and validation and I did not receive enough of it from this animal. If I cannot get the things I need from an animal, then it must be subhuman. They mustn't mind meandering on a farm and eating corn for years on end. Wouldn't mind being trapped in enclosures or having makeup tested on their skin.

I think a lot of people rightfully gain empathy for animals, but fail to inspect how they inherently are animals too. Sure, it's fetishized and linked to masculinity in pop culture in the way men and women are portrayed as predator and prey, but is that it? We view ourselves as such complex creatures that terms like ""survival"" are only reserved for when we are in distress or at our lowest. We evaluate our own sense of living above basic survival to the point where we are enlightened with post modernism.

But what if we were never meant to be self aware? Our bodies were not built to comprehend the idea of purpose. That we are stuck in a brain that physically can never understand the complexity of our existence. We are taught tools like mindfulness and meditation not to widen our mind, but to make it docile. We fear that falling into the rabbit hole of deeper understanding is to fall into madness. We are not built to contain this forbidden knowledge. We were designed to just eat, sleep, perform, mirror and procreate. We cannot truly learn this knowledge as we were never built to contain it. We call ourselves miracles and special and have listed trillions of possible reasons for our existence but we cannot look at an ant and see how similar we are to it.

I feel broken by this cursed knowledge and crave the simplicity of the womb. Where everything was safe, where nothing could hurt me, of pure bliss. I want to escape from my mind that haunts me. I don't know if I want to pay the cost for my mind anymore. I want my pain to be subsided but I am trapped in my head.

I feel I will never be able to wash away my nihilism and return to the womb. That is unless through psychadelics. I have been craving LSD and I didn't understand why. It was the only time I have felt pure bliss. I miss it. I miss feeling like life was simple. I miss feeling like I had my whole life ahead of me and that being an exciting concept. I feel like I'm suffocating and being taken over by an emptiness. Like one of a tree turned to charcoal. A second-hand shop's warehouse. A deceased Grandma's home before its cleared out. I feel like an echo of who I once was, but that my spirit is lost to the abyss.

It all feels spoilt. I feel like I'm in a gallery of my own life, looking at the art that lines white walls. Walking through the space, but noticing small yellow labels stuck on the canvases saying ""sold"". It feels like I could've had a life where I didn't feel so broken if it wasn't ruined before I had the chance to tame it.

What would you give to go back? Back to the time we were apes? Maybe to a time we were some wild form of sea life? A form of bacteria? A fetus in the womb?

What would you do if you knew you would never escape? You knew you would live a life pretending to concede to modern life. Accepting capitalism and war and politics and technology and retirement and taxes and science and art and job security and rent and Medicare and emails. Doesn't it all seem ridiculous?

I feel like I'm living in a play. I wake up at 7am with an alarm and go to work to pretend not to be a person for 9 hours everyday. I then speak to people I will never connect with and am accused of making their life more difficult because I cannot make the one thing they need appear in their hand. Some underpaid factory worker (living in a country you can't pronounce) made this item you are trying on right now, and you are asking me if they made a second one in your size in a specific shade of blue.

I feel stuck in a doll house, playing dress up, watching people act as if we have choices anymore. We are locked in these bodies in this society where we have lost ourselves to arbitrary rolls. We have stuck monkeys in suits and asked them to comprehend the reason for human existence. We then act surprised when they say the reason is that a bigger and even MORE complex human created us (like we couldn't get enough of ourselves to begin with). On top of that, we actually then decided to name this guy. Like how we name our kid Tim or our gold fish Bubbles, we had the audacity to call the reason for our existence God.

It's almost comical how cute it all looks from a distance. Simultaneously, how frustrating it is that everyone continues to play pretend. Like when you laugh at a funeral. How utterly ashamed you feel looking at the guests and it setting in that you disturbed them. It's exhausting being told to stop wearing a mask and to ""stop pretending"" and then actually being more authentic and feeling ostracized.

I don't want this anymore, it's destroying me. These thoughts feel like a blackhole. I try and claw my way out of them, but I feel the gravity pull me back in to explore. ""Maybe this time I'll finally understand"". ""Maybe I'll finally uncover why I act this way"". I will never reach the epicenter. I will be cursed to look into the depths and only find scraps of what I truly desire. I have overindulged in the devil fruit and have lost myself to the madness of the self.

What must I do now to live another day? How can I claw myself out of the hole and learn to merely orbit it. My journey will be treacherous but my body is strong. I will have to learn to connect my mind to my vessel and my vessel to this earth. I want to find peace.

I only wish that when I die I breath a heavy sigh. One of acceptance. I may never make it to that bed at 90 and have the opportunity to experience the bliss I have always longed for. I may be hit by a train tomorrow and have my ending cut short. However I go, I want to know I gave this whole life-thing a fair shot. That in spite of the turmoil, I tried.

If I cannot find the strength to live for myself (the me who is typing this right now, the me that is announcing each thought onto this screen) that I may live for the girl in the womb. The girl who believed she was a mermaid. The girl who played pretend with her brother. The girl who buys a rabbit when she moves into her own apartment. The girl who gets seriously injured in a car crash. The girl who reads her book in the sun. The girl who finds the love of her life. The girl who watches her mum pass away. The girl who withers away in a retirement village.

I feel incapable of finding my soul in my heart but I have to keep trying for her.

If not for me, but for her.

As the title implies, i have no joy in living. What we call “life / living” is just reactions to external stimuli, reactions and stimuli which we arn’t even sure are really “real”. Life is a constant pain, rarely anything of true joy comes from it, and any true joy is quickly overshadowed by negativity, leaving “life” as just a cycle of suffering, in which we’re teased with happiness, yet are thrown back into misery.

Yet all we know about “life” is that we exist.. thats our only proof.. what if there is more to life, and just living… something we cant experience or understand because of our own spiritual, physical, behavioural, and mental limitations. We will never know what is truely real, we will never know Real Reality.

I believe life as we know it is unnatural - all our lives are, are various synapses and electric x chemical reactions in our brains, interpreting what we call information, and the hundreds of millions of years ago when the VERY VERY first life was created, before microorganisms and bacteria - the first synaptic chemical reaction - was random chance.

A random signal chain that continued to expand on itself, creating what we now call DNA, and Cells, and Mitosis, and Genus, and Species, etc, etc, etc. It was random

All of us are random, we have no purpose, no soul, we barely have a consciousness, and have hijacked our basic survival needs for pleasure, and commodity, instead of survival, and needs.

I seek no pleasure, because i need no pleasure, i follow no god, because we have no god, i seek death, because death is the only thing that can return us to our neutral equilibrium and NATURAL STATES OF NON-EXISTANCE.",1

Yet, we were not too overly-modernized as a species in our social aspect, we knew how to banter, our social skills and cues were still perfectly navigable, we knew how to call out actual injustice and evil, and we knew how to enjoy the moment and not let the bullshit of media sensationalism and over-moralization get to us. It seems with the advent of the social media though things have gotten more divisive, sensationalized and over-moralized. Social media, the internet and the news industrial complex work together to fabricate societal ills for profit. As we continue to reach the crumbles of our current work culture, you wonder to yourself, when will we find our peace of mind and our coolness factor again as a species? It seems like thanks to the internet, social media and the news industrial complex our social and cognitive abilities are reverting back to animalistic urges, is gotten so bad people cannot tell real from fake, satire from real news and someone acting to someone being genuine and authentic, it is all intermerged now and with our declining attention spans, what couldn't we ask for more out of this disaster?

Modern society feels so soulless, so over-corporatized and so bleak, I do not see a way out of this, however my view of history being linear is changing so that's good at least.

1696968695.0,Nothing makes sense,"I often think about the universe, specifically how it started.

Obviously there are theories around the beginning of the universe as we know it, most credible being the big bang theory, but this honestly just gives me more questions than answers.

I get that before the big bang, time may not have existed in the way we experience it today (although that is a whole mindf\*\*k in itself), but even still, what created the starting point.

Surely there must be a start somewhere... but there also can't be a start, because what happened before then.

So it seems impossible for there to be a beginning, but it's also impossible for there to not be a beginning. So it should be impossible for anything to exist... but then it would also seem just as impossible for there to be nothing...because what even is 'nothing'. There has to be something surely?

When you really get down to it, nothing makes any sense whatsoever.

Even god (whether you believe or not) doesn't really explain this because you guess it... what created god?

However, I can somewhat comprehend, or at least come to terms with the fact that it will never end and stuff will go on for eternity. It just doesn't make any sense how it all started...

It the universe everything? Or is there a whole other plane of something that we can't even comprehend? Something that shares no resemblance to a universe or life or atoms or anything we can fathom, it's just something else entirely? Who knows..

I don't really know the point of this post and have no idea if it even makes sense, but then again, nothing makes sense so this is just as random and meaningless / meaningful as anything else.

1696932896.0,The absurdism of human emotions (Camus),"Hi,

I was reading Camu’s ’Myth of Sisyphus’, the part where it says ’The total absence of hope doesn‘t equal despair’ just like ‘Continuous rejection doesn’t equal to renounce’.

I was then inspecting my own emotional state and realised how absurd and non-sensical most of my pain and suffering are.

Take a dramatic break up. You understand the other person’s immature behaviour reflects just that, his immaturity. A negligent parent, the same. Yet so many people are traumatised by this.

I wonder what comes first: a faulty logic and then emotional pain, or emotional pain and a faulty logic as a result; then both enter a loop where they feed off each other.

How can we get out of this absurdism?

It seems to me no one has been able to. Buddhists say ‘observe your thoughts And feelings, don’t identify by them’, yet that doesn’t transform them. You are still hurt, depressed, and so on.

So what’s the way out? What’s the way to align what your mind knows with what you heart feels?

Now how people respond to it is a different perspective, but I have noticed more and more we're dealing with social issues as opposed to existential issues such as predatory wildlife, living out in the woods, trying to plow a field for food, etc you get the idea. Meanwhile we filled our pathetic little voids with social problems such as bullying, gossip, racism, war, polarization, religious proselytization and government corruption. The question is, where do the so called evolutionary, and in particular, psychological, need for this come from? My guess is that adversity can help someone sharpen their problem-solving skills, these problem-solving skills came in more handy when we were living in tribes, but in today's society where everyone says fuck all to ''community'', what even is the point? Adversity can develop a stimuli to that of developing psychological  and mental preparedness for future negative endeavors, there is the negativity bias at play here. But seriously, do people not know how to appreciate the peace of the ''present'' moment at all?

Why does it HAVE to involve some discomfort?,"Honestly it feels like by having become alive we got into a bit of a trap. We were fine, floating around in an incomprehensible, inexplicable eternal void that was sweet and embraced and protected us from everything. No good things happened to us either but since we never ever had a consciousness before, we didn’t know any better and obviously were just fine in that inexplicable state of “pre-birth nothing”; I wish I could understand what that state was.

But now we DO have absolutely everything to lose. Including our one and only chance to ever be in this world. Now we KNOW that being in that inexplicable eternal void means loss and it means missing out on EVERYTHING.

It means decay. It means disposal. It means decomposition, burning, cremation, and being forgotten. It means people being relieved without you and moving on like you never existed.

Since we have a full-on consciousness, experiences and personality and life now, it doesn’t make sense that we would have all that evaporate into god knows where and be re-swallowed by that same eternal void. Even though that void was alright before, now we don’t even have the excitement or anticipation that we will at one point be conceived, since at death it’s already lived, over and done with. We’re FORCED to die so someone else can live, and we’re disposed of forever like rubbish. 

We cross the great divide twice. Once at conception and once at death. I don’t get how millions of people seemed to have already crossed it and never came back where are they now? I’d need proof it’s the same state or I’d lose my mind",1

1696877798.0,"I hope this is allowed, I just need an outlet to talk about thoughts that have been making me feel very distressed for the past year.","MONDAY OCTOBER 9, 2023 (4:27 PM Canada Newfoundland Time)

(F16) I made a reddit account specifically to talk about these thoughts that haven't gone away for almost a year now for two reasons:

1.) I haven't been able to find anyone else online talking about thinking this way and if I can be the representation that brings others comfort of not being alone in this that I never had, it would bring me a little bit of peace back.

2.) Anytime I attempt to talk about this with anyone my age I often get responses from them being like, ""Woww you're sooooo deep"", sarcastically. But the issue is I'm not trying to be deep, I've genuinely been thinking this way for so long has brought me an immense amount of distress and it makes me feel very isolated.

One thing I will say is I'm bad with words, I'm going to do my best to describe my experiences but a lot of them don't have words to suit them. As well as I would like to be taken seriously more than anything because I've been internalizing this all for so long, if there is a part that anyone doesn't understand, please ask and I will do my best to. Also it is fine if you do believe in God, I do not, and this will include details about that, please do not try to get me to turn to your religion, I'm not interested.

So it started my sophomore year (im a junior now), around when I had started smoking weed quite often, I have no clue if thats what caused me to start having these thoughts but thats around when they started. I became dependent on it and went day in and day out not sober as a very bad coping mechanism, and after a while I began dealing with what I can only describe as derealization, there's no other word I've found that has fit it better. I felt completely detached from myself and from the world around me, I hardly ever talked, when I did have a conversation with someone it would be so difficult for me to find a response that I would end up just smiling and nodding. I could take in what people said I just didn't know what to put out. There was just something about everything that just made me look at it and be like, ""This is impossible, this isn't real."" I felt detached from my senses and oftentimes would just lie down on my bedroom floor and just stare at the popcorn ceiling above me and just think, thinking about everything and nothing all at once, about the fact that humans are just animals, how we don't have any inherent value over them, over plants, genuinely over anything even as small as a grain of sand--and that any value we think we do is completely made up because we were told we had it since we were young. By the end of the day we are the same as all animals, we just live a bit differently. Because of this, I can't view us as anything but just another species of animal, every interaction, the way people talk, the way they move, it just looks animalistic to me. It feels like we're not where we're supposed to be. I don't know if it freaks me out because i was raised catholic, always being taught that we were ""made in likeness to God"" and that we're supposed to be special in comparison to all of creation, but one day realized I didn't believe in anything regarding the faith so my brain is processing and trying to unlearn that or what. But just like imagine if you looked at everyone and they were just apes walking around with clothes, that's how I view humans, just apes.

Another thing I've been struggling with is the concept why I exist specifically in this skin at this time in this place. Like what were the chances of me being born specifically in the 2000's? What were the chances of me being born to my family specifically? What was stopping my soul from being put into a sea slug or an ant or an elephant or even a microscopic organism? Why was I born in this body specifically, what stopped my soul from being that of a Vietnam soldier or a young boy in Ireland during the potato famine, a Mesopotamian servant, born as a caveman before we had all of our technological advances? Like why specifically this body of any of them? Why was I born at a time in which we think we're so close to bringing most of the species on our Earth to extinction?

THIS IS TO BE CONTINUED!! I have things I have to work on and I'll continue adding thoughts to this later. Also I plan on talking about this to someone tonight who I trust so I will give an update about how that goes.",1

However, I am not at peace. And I don’t feel it’s because of a lack of internal order. But rather a hard time coping with others, societal, social distortion, disorder. It’s hard for me to engage with others, i.e. they are so chronically stressed and unable to just BE and can’t accept me just BE-ing, that it throws me back into a state of physical distress, particularly choking. 

Heeding back to the obstacles and fear I’ve overcome this past year- my father died by choice (he would consider it ‘self sacrifice’). (1yr 3 months ago) I ended up embodied a lot of his becomings. I would choke on yawns, I had previously learned how to ‘suppress’ yawning and the skill turned on me, to choking on yawning. My nervous system was shot.

I’ve focused on breath work and leaning into fear, and overall I’m feeling better and more ‘in control/ in touch’ with my embodied experience than I’ve ever known….

But when I interact with people who are scared, restless, projecting, or unaccepting of my awareness (&/or) boundaries… 

I have a very hard time being around people. I revert back to choking sometimes because I am delicate still. I become exhausted by there meer presence quickly. I can get angry (internally) with myself abt my responses…

And ultimately I’m mad at my body. I feel my embodiment is a prison, limiting, my brain has reached a level that my body is lagging.

Your fortress feels impenetrable and the distance so great This is a dangerous mentality, for destruction is tireless. Destruction will not stop. While you sleep destruction is flying in your direction. If you become too comfortable with the illusion of safety, security, and distance you feel you have created between yourself and destruction it will catch up to you and you may not be prepared to recreate the safer conditions. we should dance with destruction and create a balance in the cat and mouse game that is our relationship with it. A balance between being comfortable and running for our lives.

1696716794.0,How do I cope with thinking about the impending end of everything?,"I have been doing a lot of thinking recently, and I'm pretty good at suppressing these kind of thoughts and being able to live my life without the constant fear of leaving the universe forever, but it's back and worse than ever before.  


I keep thinking about how once I'm gone, my essence, my soul essentially will be extinguished. I won't be able to experience the negatives and positives of life, and life down on earth will continue to move without me, and I won't even know it. I can't perceive the feeling of nothing because it's literally impossible and that's what scares me. You're just there, and then you're gone and you aren't here for anything else. You do your time in the universe and then you leave and never return. What's even worse is when the universe itself ends, there won't be a soul or any essence of a living being left anywhere and that scares me. The eternal darkness and how nothing keeps happening forever makes me shit myself. I can't wrap my head around the fact that nothing keeps happening forever.   


I don't want to leave, I'm so scared. What if people forget about me? Even worse, what if  people forger about me and I don't even know it. People will talk about me for a couple years, maybe even my kids will talk about me until they die, and stories might be told for a couple generations, but then I'm done, just like every other ancestor in my lineage. I'm scared of my story ending, and not continuing.

1696670321.0,How To Get Over Existential Death Anxiety?,"Hey, basically the title says it all.

I remember the first time I had a panic attack about death. I was seven driving back home from school, looking out at the sunset as my mom played music from her phone. The song was ""For Forever"" from the musical Dear Evan Hansen. And if you haven't heard the song or seen the play the basic premise is a highschool bully commits suicide after having done nothing with his life while one of his victims a dorky kid with a broken arm tries to salvage some of his legacies and spur a hopeful message of remembrance from his death.

But despite how hopeful the song is and how uplifting the musical is. I just remember in that moment, something clicking in my child brain that went ""Wait Connor's dead, where did he go? Is he still somewhere? Did he just stop existing?"" (Connor is the bully). And from then it was cemented in my brain that there is nothing after death.

I was raised Catholic and was told to believe in God and heaven and all that jazz, but no matter what I say or proclaim to believe, all I see is darkness after death. I get frequent panic attacks, mostly at night when I'm alone, maybe once a week. And it can be triggered very easily just by watching certain morbid subjects or topics.

It's not a fear of being forgotten or of losing family to death or anything like that. It's entirely selfish in a way because it's just an immense fear that I won't exist after death, that there is nothing.

And yes I know the beauty of death, I understand the need for mortality. Having a finite life is what gives it meaning. But I can tell myself that all I want doesn't change the fact there could be nothing after I pass away. Doesn't change this innate fear, doesn't change the anxiety and the depression I feel from this pounding dread.

And the dread is kind of amplified when I think about the possible afterlives that could exist. I don't like the idea of heaven, because it essentially means only feeling happy for all time. While basically going insane with no purpose because why do anything when you have all of eternity to do it? I don't like the idea of reincarnation either, because that entails you forgetting everything from your past lives and experiences. And forgetting everything that you are (in my mind) is effectively the same thing as ceasing to exist.

So any advice or hopeful outlooks would be much appreciated. I hope you all have a wonderful day, and are doing great.",1

A bit of a physical/metaphysical question.

In our Universe, if we can colonize the galaxy and unite in a hive mind and combat the laws of thermodynamics so we can exist forever, recycling matter/energy and avoiding the heat death of the Universe - then we would achieve the Absolute. However, physicists say that this would be impossible.

Can realities exist with less restrictive laws of nature (but still mathematically valid) that would allow for an Absolute to form and exist indefinitely? This would practically equal God.

If there are other universes that were there for like 10^10000000000 years, maybe some of them reached an Absolute state (if the laws of reality even allow it).",1
1696612952.0,My theory on god and the universe,"So I was just sitting in bed about to go to sleep and as one would I just started thinking about the universe and god and purpose and the whole “what is life” thing. Well anyways, I was thinking about the Christian god and how he is said be in all of us and in everything we do, that connection with others is god and how all the experiences we have are all meaningful since god has a plan for us. Why can he not interact with us or do mystical things or show us that he is really upon us? When is the time in which he will come back to us? Well I think that our universe is simply like a book. It opens, there’s a story with events that is written which has an end, and then it closes. After it’s written it cannot be re-written as it wouldn’t be the same story, and thus why I think that the God of our universe is simply the writer of the story of our universe and thus why he cannot intercept or alter our lives since it is already written. This is why God in the Catholic and Jewish sense is said to be always, in past, in present, and future. God is everywhere since he is the creator, but he wouldn’t change this great book of creation. Since it is a book though, you can read it again at some point, so once our story ends we may just relive this experience again in the future when this book just so happens to be opened again. There are other books though with other authors, which would align with the infinite universe theory as well. Idk but I give credit to the dab I took last night for this, hope y’all enjoy.",1

1696540846.0,"I keep seeing death-related posts, but people aren’t mentioning Becker","If you’re not familiar, Ernest Becker argues that the inherent biologically necessary terror of annihilation is the ultimate root anxiety of anxieties. Humans, being temporally gifted creatures, can figure out that one day everything dies, including oneself. This terror is so all consuming that in order to survive, we build up systems of meaning and imbed ourselves within systems of power to repress the fear. Furthermore, we attempt to do something grand with our lives to beat death, we may try to live on in the memories of many (such as by becoming famous), we may try to literally beat death (trying to find the fountain of youth, cryogenics, supplements), or we may take a religious route (we don’t really die, we transition).

All in all, terror of death stimulates our need to be the hero in our own story, whether that means jumping on a grenade to save your platoon, raising the next generation, being a hard working provider, or succeeding in some grand accomplishment. 

It’s not a provider of meaning necessarily, but lays out the groundwork for what meaning is and why we care. It helped me cope with why everybody seems so mindlessly caught up in managing trivial things like pieces of paper and showing up to specific places at specific times.

1696534984.0,Thoughts that pass through my head every so often,"Over the past month or two, I've been hit by an existential dread more severe than ever. I recall thinking about aging and dying when I was younger, but it was never as intense or streched over a longer period of time as it isnow. I'd like to share what bothers me most when it comes to death and life's transience.

1. Realising that aging is just our bodies gradually becoming a weaker, decrepit, shallow version of our younger selves. Sometimes when  I see a person in ther 40s - 60s I get this picture in my head of them being young and vibrant and realise that all aging is is just time wearing down our bodies, making us slow, tired, less responsive, and as time passes we keep losing our abillities that actually make life worthhile, such as doing sports, travelling, making love, or any physical activity in general. Our cognitive funcition seems to follow the same path.  To cope with this we tend to make up all sorts of fables such as ""you start to stop caring about other's people opinions"", ""you become wiser"" and so on. There is not a thing in the world that I would gain with old age that I would value more than the energeticity of youth.
2. Finding out that there is no such thing as a peaceful death. Hollywood and global media has painted us this picture that on our deathbed we'll be smiling, saying goodbye to our loved ones, until a moment comes when we just peacefully fall asleep and die minutes after. In reality, the natural dying process is long, painful, and extremely undignifying. You spend your last couple of days lying in the hospital bed, not able to drink or eat, constantly sleeping, and in the very end you just lie there, with your eyes and mouth wide open, gasping for air, until you just shut off. And the worst thing about that is that those are your final moments. Your final experience in this one life you have will just be your body struggling to stay alive for as long as it can, and then it's done. No more you. I don't even think I'd want my loved ones to witness me in this state.  The idea of dying of ""old age"" or ""natural causes"" sounds too optimistic. The reality is that your body simply succumbs to the dozens of ailments you get as you age and are unable to combat them. My idea of a perfect death is something quick, unexpected. A bullet in the head for example. The idea of me lying in a hospital bed knowing that soon enough my consciousness will cease to exist forever sounds utterly terrifying.
3. Realising that time moves fast and everyone and everything I ever cared about is temporary and soon enough there will be nobody to tell the tale of me and the wonderful experiences I had with people I love. My loving girlfriend, my family, my pets, my friends are all damned to cease existing and once we're gone no one will give a jack shit about our memories and all the times we had so much fun together. Life is  just destined to have a sad ending. Telling someone you love them is just promising them that one day either of you are going to be heartbroken, either by the other person dying, or by you splitting up for other unspecified reason. One day, if you live long enough, you will be old, alone, or with very few living friends/family, tired of life, in constant anguish. All the while witnessing other young people enjoying the best years of their lives, not giving a shit about your sadness.

I've come to the point where thoughts like these follow me day and night. Whether I'm at college, at home, in a bar with friends, with my girl, at the park, you name it, these dreadful thoughts keep slicing at my sanity. The worst thing is when I go to sleep, and suddenly realise I'm bound to die and get that mini panic attack where my heartbeat and breathing skyrocket for a minute. I just don't know how to find comfort while being aware of my horrible, inescapable fate. I am not posting this to come out as special, nor am I trying to make all of you feel terrified allong with me, I just want to vent out SOMEWHERE. I wan't someone to tell me how to feel better. I never thought I'd become this bad

If that's possible, maybe our current brains are Boltzmann brains that spontaneously manifested with fake memories of our entire lives. But that's not what I'm interested in.

I'm interested in the possibility that maybe, trillions upon trillions of years into the future, MY brain will manifest itself, or at least an identical version of myself.

If that happens, as unlikely as it may be... maybe, from my perspective, when I die, I will be immediately transported into the distant future. And maybe this process will happen an infinite number of times.

If that is possible for me, it's possible for everyone that ever lived and will ever live.

If soul (or something) exist after physical death...

if this universe or at least this planet will end up disintegrated, big bang, supernova, blackhole etc...

everything we want or try to create, or todo, or posses etc, most probably guided by our survival instincts, even our need of feeling good another day and again and again, but it is ok as ours instincts demand it and that keep us alive and interested and healthy and feeling well.

and still, consider that, imagine that, if everything material ends, for a huge time, til a new material universe is re-created, could our attachment be our enprisoning factor leading our soul (or our something) to also degrade into void after waiting too much for this universe re-creation?  
Could not being attached (i dont mean being careless) let we find out more beyond this universe?

I realized in my pondering that the nature of our existence is a soul using a body as a vessel to create a universe and experience a world, and life on Earth. I feel very connected and grounded in this belief. I feel like I read a lot of others realizing this same thing and then feeling helpless but i just am more curious. I want to learn and create myself and nurture myself. I try to do as many good things for my soul, healing things like exercise, writing, meditating, etc. But where do I go from here? I feel like I just woke up and i’m a little lost. If anyone could tell me websites with articles about this side of existentialism or books to read that could guide me, or anything at all. I feel like there’s ways to see this side of things in a very positive light, but I am unsure if this belief system and be intertwined with others, such as christianity or buddhism. even if all you have to offer is a similar experience or guiding train of thought, please be my guest :)",1

1695937705.0,Determinism deconstructs Existentialism?,"I can't help but wonder that, if existence operates on a cause-and-effect chain of events, there exists no free will but existentialism states that we operate based upon our own will. It seems to me that we make sense of the world around us with science via causation and, if there has to be a cause to every effect, we are only deluding ourselves that we can act freely because we want to feel as if we do. 

Let's say that establishing a sense of purpose/meaning requires agency. If determinism holds true as a fundamental component of the universe and how we came to be, we can never act freely to create individual meaning. This means that it was determined since the Big Bang that the people we are right now would exist regardless of probability and every action we made in the past and will make in the future.

My question is, if you believe in determinism, can you still establish your own meaning in life? If you don't, what substitute do you have for determinism? Is agency still conceivable?  ",1

1695847685.0,Who you really are beyond your mistakes,"You are not your mistakes. 

You are the lessons and the enlightenment that has revealed who you truly are through either your *moral suffering* or your *indifference* to your past perceived mistakes.

 A regret always reveals your true nature. Instead of rejecting evil and cowering that you can't beleive you acted out on it, embrace it as that which you are, that which has capability to manifest through you. From there you can reintroduce evil ignorance to love, to knowledge of itself.  Through this, you will be revelead to yourself. 

In existence, evil wants to be reunited with love, through you, and suffering is the balancing act of good and evil.. therefore as the buddhists say, existence is suffering at its most basic level. 

 A pure life is what everyone strives for.. yet it is in complete acceptance of the good and the bad where the truth of existence is born. Errors in judgement or mistimings happen, momentary selfishness or impulses, that is the nature of our existence, if you grieve a negative outcome, this reveals love is strong in you. 

You could live a life of complete non-infliction, right always, and that's great, but you will never truly understand through experience the scope of existence if you have never made a mistake considered undesirable. 

Don't cower from evil, don't fear it, understand it and acceptt it to its fullest capability, and then introduce it to it's one true love - goodness;  and from there,  you will be revealed for who you truly are, your personal representation of 'good' and 'evil'

Your true emerging preference will go forth from here. There's a reason ignorance breeds evil and knowledge breeds understanding of both. Evil is trying to find its way back to love. And through this union is true knowledge of both sides of the coin - the Yin and the Yang as the chinese culture suggested.

1695821752.0,Meaning of life?,"Recently in late July I got hung up on trying to comprehend that I exist and live in a universe that exists versus doesn’t exist. The thoughts were followed by huge panic attacks and feeling like I would just evaporate. 

As this progressed and my mind seemingly felt to be frying. I started to feel like I was going to die. 
Suddenly, I became fixated on my personal existence and inevitable death. 

At first these thoughts scared me but as time went on and my brain kept churning. These chronic thoughts kept beating me down. 

I suddenly couldn’t enjoy anything without consciously thinking what’s the point of doing anything at all if I’m just going to die someday. 

Now my mind started projecting everything as work. Wiping my ass, showering, eating, and don’t even get me started on work and paying bills. 

All of this work every second of living just to be alive when I’m just going to die one day. 

Obviously, this was terrifying and I began to search for meaning. I have searched religions, philosophy. Etc etc. I found that either I die into a memory less state of non-existence for all of eternity or I go to an infinite afterlife, source consciousness, reincarnation. 

If we die and become nothing I’ve found that people often pursue advancing human civilization. I ask, “why?” humans aren’t and infinite creation. They will cease to exist one day so that seems fruitless. 
So, I live for my family? That’s a Nobel gesture and I wouldn’t want them to be sad. But if I die into nothing then so will they. So no matter what happens to me when they die poof all their sorrows and everything disappear too. 

If there is an afterlife and my consciousness goes on forever, that frankly sounds terrifying. I can’t begin to comprehend “infinity” in fact I have “Apeirophobia”.

I have no desire to live forever. I don’t fear death because of a fear I won’t exist, I fear death more upon the idea of eternity. 

So, now I exist in quite the paradox. 
I don’t want to live forever. But there is a chance that happens. One can say that isn’t possible yet how the fuck is the universe possible. That just proves anything can happen. Yet, living day by day knowing I will die fucking sucks. I find many peoples philosophy to live is defined by their ego and they don’t connect the dots that if life is meaningless they won’t remember it no matter how well they live it. 

I suddenly have no idea why I’m doing anything. Idk why I wrote this. Idk why I’m going to work today. I no longer perceive all the greatest minds I looked up to as even aware. I find joy in nothing. Yet I woke up today breathing and my nervous system does that all on it’s own.

https://qz.com/866352/scientists-say-your-mind-isnt-confined-to-your-brain-or-even-your-body

Not sure I'm with this take. Maybe I'm falling prey to that very same traditionalist view of mind they're trying to transcend here, but whenever I see a post like this, it's just proof of how interconnected the mind is to the brain, specifically ego. These ""the mind is everything"" articles always sound like the stance of someone's ego running wild. 

It's maybe a bit of a defense mechanism. Because what's the main stance I've been assuming since I first got into existentialist philosophy? Deconstructing solipsism. Which, thank Bergson, Moore and Wittgenstein, and even Hegel [""the very fact that something is determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended"", anyone?] for being on that side too. 

So...enlighten me! What IS this exactly talking about? Is it accurate? Is it not accurate at all? Is it scientism? Externalism? Go nuts!

It just feels like I've truly awoken to the sheer scale of just how fucking horrifying existence is, and the fact that it literally cannot ever be escaped, and my brain is understandably going fucking berzerk and either feels the need to make me stay in bed 24/7 with my eyes shut desperately trying to blank this new awareness out, or drink alcohol until I'm drunk so I get even just a fucking moment of relief from this unbearable terror I feel 24/7 constantly, if I have to leave bed for whatever reason I scrunch my face up in agony and discomfort right up until I can return to my bed and resume lying there completely motionless.

Now that it’s done and I’m back to this mortal world, I don’t know how to make sense of it anymore. I don’t know how to put faith in this fabric of reality that my ego has constructed. I don’t know how to go about loving the people I love knowing it’s all superficial in an ulterior sense, knowing every thought is a function of my ego and that reality is a contradiction, a construct.

* about how much beauty, love and graditude should I feel towards the life I live

I start thinking about how my life **COULD** be worse or how my life **COULD** be better in case I had commited/commitedn't some actions in my life. ​

And the thing is, in a logical way I understand that every bit of happiness is to be enjoyed by and that one cannot resolve every evil/wrong thing that is going on in this world and that it is actually not one's responsibility, but I'm afraid that if I simply lean into that blissful way of thinking and just ignore all the evil that might/did/will happen, I'm a **bad person** for ignoring all that evil and not mentally attending into all the suffering. ​

Also, I think the reason of that is not only some kind of anxiety disorder, but my inner philosophy of trying to wrap all the world inside my brain. And because world mostly consists of pain, I end up being in pain. ​

And the only way to do that is to just accept yourself as a dust in the wind of the existance's chaos and live your stupid human life, but I just cannot function that way. ​

sometimes it makes me grunt and moan in terror and fear, it's genuinely fucking agony and it's making me feel like I HAVE to end it, not because I want to but because I HAVE to, or else I'll just keep spiraling further and further into this terrifying realisation and reach absolute never ending psychological hell

The thing that fucks with me is that this doesn't feel like mental illness, like I am mentally ill yes, but this specific thing just feels to me like realising something truly fucked up about existence which I shouldn't have, like opening Pandora's box but to an extreme level, this solipsistic claustrophobia feels like legitimately dangerous Lovecraftian knowledge that I've really really fucked myself over by becoming aware of, I feel like this realisation is something which would cause anyone's brain to freak the fuck out and start self destructing and eating itself alive


I basically live in bed now because of these panic attacks, I hardly eat or shower or anything I just fucking lay there eyes closed desperately trying to forget what I know or just come to terms with it, but I just fucking CAN'T, it's too excrutiatingly terrified, to realise that I really am truly 10000000000% trapped in my own consciousness with absolutely fucking no way out ever

Is my life basically over now? Have I permanently destroyed my mind? I never even took anything to get to this place I'm in now, never even had weed before, I developed this completely naturally",1

As the title says: we as humans are nothing but organic creations on this earth but emotions and intelligence (which varies) is what makes us feel differrent.

These emotions wrote our history and it's what makes us integrate/adapt & procreate.

You don't know yourself and you never will because your thoughts aren't even yours they are influenced by the people/media that you follow & what makes you follow is the thrive to feel included.

God never existed as we perceive HIM but He exists as a primal drive/feeling in us that works entangled with intelligence & that's why people that keep arguing over religion with science are just simple apes, because religion goes hand in hand with science, regardless of what you may think of me as reading this post keep in mind that God (as in emotion) drove the ancient engineers to create many things that drove to this point.

Heaven & Hell exist here and they are an result of our actions, emotions, intelligence and mindset but unfortunately we don't choose the circumnstaces we're born in

The people that wrote the books consisting of the bible were frighteningly intellignet humans for that time because they were mostly right.

To explain more simply how we as humans are inherently wrong of what we believe in take these following examples:

1)Imagine you are an cruise captain travelling the ocean & you encounter an whirlpool (water vortex) the sight of this monstrosity gives you an feeling of hell. but if you fall into it nothing will happen but sink into the water, something wthat would have also happened if you're ship suffered an malfunction.

2) Same thing goes for encountering an black hole in space, your mind upon experiencing this will go into shock but as soon as you get sucked into it you will fall at peace with the forecomings.

So struggling with feelings of worthlessnes/depression over materialistic & dumb modern things such as never having a girlfriend or not having the latest phone/shoes car or whatever is pointless nad pathetic but regardless of of being aware of this it will hardly go way since the emotion of being equal/powerful will hardly go away.

Imagine you were born blind, all your life would be different and you never would be aware of all this inevitable drive as long you will have what truly matter for you: Family.

You are nothing but the universe experiencing itself.

THe act of having a family gives you fulffillment and you do it to finally be happy and at peace, but you never know the path your offspring will take.

1695316117.0,We really don't know anything about anything,"We don't even know if we even really exist in any meaningful way. Let me give you a simple analogy real quick. Let's say I'm Jack, an english speaker and I want to do business with a Japanese man who only speaks japanese. Jill my assistant speaks englsih and spanish. The japanese man's assistant speeks japanese and french. So we need a translator that speaks spanish and french. Every letter, every contract, correspondence, whatever, would have to go through those three individuals before reaching either me or the Japanese man. But here's the thing, the entire time I'm doing business with the japanese man Jill is the only person I ever come in direct contact with. How do I know the Japanese man or the other two individuals even exist? Jill could be forging every document for all I know. This is what the experience of reality is like. The japanese man represents the world outside my body. His assistant is my body. The translator is my brain. Jill is my minds eye, she creates the illusion of reality that I see around me. And I'm the inner eye that sees the illusion created by Jill.

According to Jill everything I see is true, everything I see is real. But I don't  know, how can I know? All I know is what Jill tells me. I see a lot of you people on this sub struggling with thoughts of solipsism. That's nothing compared to the actual reality of our situation. What you really should be struggling with is whether or not you exist at all. I really don't think I do exist. Sounds insane, I know. How can I make a claim if I don't exist? 

The way I see it I don't dictate my thoughts. My thoughts simply occur. Like everything else I observe my entire identity as a person, my thoughts, beliefs, actions is all just information that Jill feeds to me. I feel like everything is just theater. It's like Jill is the movie itself and jack is the protagonist of the movie. And jack has become aware of the fact that he is nothing more than a fictional character created by the movie. Before gaining awareness jack use to identify himself as the person sitting in the seat in the theater in front of the screen watching the movie. And whatever was happening on screen was what was happening in the real world. But now jack realizes that the theater is actually empty. And the only thing that exists is the movie. Which from my perspective is a very funny realization. Because I was born in the theater. Not literally obviously. A scene from 1989 ""Batman"" was my very first memory. So in a way it's like I came into existence in the movie theater. And the movie theater has dominated a large part of my life. So it's funny to come to this realization concerning my existence. 

But let's assume Jill is telling us the truth about everything. Because Jill has never really given me a reason to believe she's a liar. So why should I assume that she's a liar? I shouldn't. So the real world exists, I do have a physical body, a brain. And my consciousness exists trapped inside Jill. Well guess what? I still don't exist. Cause I am not my consciousness. My consciousness is something I observe outside of me. If it's outside of me it isn't me. I know it's a weird claim to make because it's my consciousness that's making these claims. It's like my consciousness is identifying as something that it isn't, which is the thing that observes consciousness. But it all plays back into my movie analogy where jack thinks he's in the theater but realizes he's actually a part of the movie.

Even if I were to assume that I am my consciousness I still don't exist. Would you argue that spiderman exists, or batman? They exist as fictional characters, but not real life people. Even if my consciousness existed in the real world I would still be just as fictional as spiderman or batman. Because not even consciousness dictates itself, I don't control what I think ever, or my choices. Its all just a long deterministic chain of causation. My entire identity is nothing more than a reflex of the original cause of reality. 

You might argue against everything being deterministic. You'd be arguing against a brick wall. I've seen glimpses of my own future. And despite not wanting what I saw to come true it did anyway. So I know for a fact it's deterministic. 

Maybe I don't exist but everything else exists right? I do have a physical body and the world outside it is infact real...right? Not really. It's all just fundamental forces compressing spacetime into virtual particles. Those virtual particles yield atoms. It's all just waves in a ocean of pixelated nothingness. Coupled with the fact that reality is deterministic you could argue that reality is indistinguishable from a potentially eternally long movie printed on the film of spacetime. 

Naturally the only thing that can be real is what is fundamental. Everything else is just fiction created by the fundamental. Jill is real and we're all just fictional characters in the mind of God. So solipsism is true, just not for you or me. It's only true for God. It's all whatever though, it doesn't really bother me anymore. It would just be nice if this movie got a happy ending already and transitioned into a neverending sitcom.

Edit: I just realized that achieving a happy ending would actually require me to move the plot of the story...one day. Hopefully Jill has written in some character motivation not to far from now.",1

&#x200B;

Up until a week ago I was a normal mid 30s millennial. Tech job in big metro area, not rich but able to live comfortably, lots of hobbies and interests around computers, cars, tech stuff, etc.

Being a bit of a space nerd I've had some past existential thoughts about the universe and where it came from, are we alone, and what happens when we die. These thoughts usually happen at night laying in bed when I can't sleep, but by the next day I'm back to my normal self. When I turned 30 I started thinking to myself: ""If I'm lucky this is 1/3 of my life, if I'm unlucky then hopefully at least 1/2 way there.""

&#x200B;

Then a week ago I was in bed on Reddit and this came across my feed and it has hit me like a freight train.

&#x200B;

I've also had these PBS Frontline documentaries in my YouTube Watch Later and finally decided to watch them:

**Aging in the U.S. (full documentary) | FRONTLINE**

&#x200B;

Huge mistake. This has put me into a full on existential dread anxiety mode. What is the point of anything, living life, making memories, collecting hobbies and stuff, if it all just goes away when we die.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have a small family, just my mom and dad (separated before I could remember when I was young), only 1 set of grandparents, and a younger brother by 2 years. I've also been with my (m) boyfriend (m) for a handful of years now. No kids in our plans as a gay couple with surrogacy being out of our reach for us.

&#x200B;

I still had the mindset like I'm 22 in college, but my 30 year old body is slowly reminding me that I'm not. I can also see it in my family getting older. I guess I'm lucky to have not had to experience any death in my immediate family yet, and I've never attended a funeral. But my grandparents are closing in on 90, my dad just turned 70, and my mom is mid 50s. I just know in the next few years I'm going to have to start facing the realities.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend has a much bigger and a bit younger family with lots of aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews but we're going to have to face it together as well eventually as they age.

&#x200B;

Then the ultimate dread, either I'm going to have to live through my boyfriend / partner dying first, or he is going to live through me dying first. And who is going to be there for us? Will we just be in a nursing home together? Hopefully not bedridden at least until the very end.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people say ""death is eternal nothingness, just like the eternal nothingness before you were born."" But in my head, we know so much about history of our universe, planet, and life on Earth, that even though I didn't personally live through it, it comforts me in knowing somewhat how we ended up here. That's why my brain can't comprehend what happens after we pass. That is the great unknown.

I have felt empty for a bit since I haven't ""believed"" in anything. After learning about existentialism and philosophy in general, learning that there likely is no life after death and truly seeing that as a real possibility is very freeing. Just because I don't believe in God doesn't mean that I don't believe in anything. 

Because I believe that there is no afterlife, that is belief. This life on earth is precious and I need to live it to the fullest. That's what I am learning for myself after years of being brainwashed and I hope to instill similar beliefs in my kids. Granted, I'll let them learn and develop their own beliefs rather than telling them that this is the ""end all be all"".

All this does is replace this seeming paradox with the exact same paradox.  Ok now you have a God.  Remember when you had such a problem with everything needing a start and nothing is eternal?

The most precious of mind connections between two individuals with unfathomable variations of cells, experiences and happen chance DNA, that would only have only ever interacted in their one existence, amongst the great forever. And so now it seems like it is you against the great forever.

Now that, that is where the pain comes from. It's a selfish mental pain, but one of the most fundamental because it is derived from it's equal and opposite - love. Can you transcend it. I'm sure from time to time. Never truly can you forget the memories. A bittersweet duality of existence.

1694931733.0,"The older I get, the more I realize that life is not worth living","As I grow older, I increasingly realize that life may not be what we were promised when we were children. It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

**Requisites**

* Passion. The books we are going to read are not exactly fun read if you don't like the subject matter. I've noticed that a significant amount of people get demoralized when they approach the text as they turn out differntly from they expected.
* Consistency. I plan on reading thirty-five to fifty pages a week (five to seven pages a day). It's not a huge time commitment but it is still a time commitment.
* I don't really care about age but I prefer people over 18 for this club.

1694963256.0,Illusion of choice and free will is making me hopeless,"Hi everyone,
I recently realized that our choices are merely an illusion, it is our brain patterns that decide what we enact, we can only be conscious about it, but even the choice of being conscious and detached is predetermined. This has given me a ton of anxiety and suicidal depression. People that 'awaken' or lead a peaceful life are lucky that the universe of cause and effect has given them that experience. But what about all the people that suffer or commit suicide? I am afraid of leading a life of suffering and never being able to let go, simply because it's not in my power and is 'decided' by the universe. Since I've realized this I've not been able to detach from my mind chatter anymore, because everytime I do I am reminded that I didn't have the choice to do so, and maybe I'm fated to end up killing myself. 
To make matters worse, I don't even see that as an escape because 'I' will just experience another life, which can be a good one but also another filled with suffering, and so on. This seems like a never ending nightmare.

1694895823.0,What would a stoic or existentialist say to someone depressed?,"Hi,

I (30F) have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for almost three years now.

I've made life-changing decisions hoping my inner experience would rearrange and stabilise in a healthy state and yet here I am, still struggling.

I've experienced a lot of loss in these last three years, in addition to a Dark Night of the Soul in my own search for meaning.

In my mind, things are very simple. This loss is part of life and some things must die within us so that others can be born. Sometimes self-realization implies leaving worthy things behind. Sometimes the lack of shadow work culminates in that loss. All is part of life and one more step in our own learning process.

I've reached a point where I see my thoughts are changing and if one wants a life of meaning it's just a matter of leading a life of service. You want a meaningful life? Well, there is plenty of people who needs help out there, a lot of activism needed, a lot of entrepreneurs, and so on. As Viktor Frankl put it, it's not only about what we want and expect from life but what it expects and requires us to do.

Yet this intellectual realisation is not changing my emotional state. Sometimes I do feel better but then there is a restrain - like my current job and contractual restrictions or the fact that I need to make money to survive - that only makes things harder and, at some point, even not worth it. I search to connect with someone outside of Reddit and I can't, so I feel lonely. I remember the times where I was mostly alone and felt great, and now that solitude sometimes kills me. 

I'm working on the things that depend on me but, like any living organism, I depend on that environment and others for survival and fulfilment.

My dad who is a very intellectual guy, believes I'm just weak and should work on my discipline. Do I miss my ex check her Insta and become depressed? Well, have the discipline to not check her Instagram. Do I get sad because I cannot do x or y? Well do z. He also doesn't care about relationships even though he relies on wealthy women for his survival. He pays so little attention to things that matter and affect me that naturally life is easier for him. And I wonder if this is just me being 'a woman', overcomplicating things.

In other words, maybe I'm just a weak coward who doesn't want to put in the work to live a life worth living.

I genuinely don't believe I'm fit for life, I'm not interested in putting in the work to stand a chance, I genuinely would like to die.

I came here hoping someone will share an insight or life experience that may help me want to live.

1694858631.0,How the hell can I move past this unbearably excrutiating awareness/knowledge I've gained?,"I know this probably isn't the right sub to post this but I legit have no idea where else to find anyone who possibly might have dealt with this specific issue

have pretty bad OCD, and the past few years existence has been my main obsession, but before spring this year, I could at least still go outside and enjoy myself somewhat, but since then I am absolutely 100% crippled and disabled with sheer panic and terror every single day, basically glued to bed unable to even eat or shower most days.

It just seems so much more than just OCD tho, it truly feels like I really have realised too much about my own existence and consciousness and it's absolutely destroying my mind, I feel so fucking bizarre now I've legit wondered if I have a brain tumor or some shit

As for the realisation/knowledge, it's basically just the realisation that solipsism is literally extremely true, and this unbearable hyperawareness that I will never ever be able to ever escape my own consciousness or my body, I feel legit physically claustrophobic inside my own consciousness and im constantly fucking tortured with the absolute EXCRUTIATING overawareness of just how ridiculously fucking bizarre and absurd consciousness and existence really is, and the fact I can literally never escape it ever, even after I die I'll probably be trapped in some kind of existence somewhere, it's like being trapped inside existence literally never ever ever fucking stops, and neither does my constant panic at this realisation, it gives me the weirdest most bizarre thoughts, it's fucking ruined my life, and im only 24

I can't stress enough the level of terror that these thoughts and realisations cause me, it literally makes me audibly gasp sometimes whilst I'm shaking in bed with my eyes closed grasping at my headboard desperately trying to forget what I know, doesn't work tho, all I do is just lay there in constant constant unending fucking panic and terror, it's turning me into a genuine alcoholic too so that's an added bonus

Seriously is there any way past this? Am I basically just perma-fucked now? Can I ever revert back to a state where in not constantly losing my mind in fear? I just wanna be able to at the very least enjoy food again and enjoy watching TV, the tiniest things like that I no longer enjoy because all of those things are part of existence and existence is what terrifies me",1

1694827158.0,Classic works pre-1950 on Nihilism,"I am writing a book.  I am exploring classic literature that is fiction, pre1950ish, that explores one of two things:

Nihilism with theme of nihilism focused on the individual rather than a focus on nihilism as it applies to society and people as whole.

or

transcdence, also focused on the individual in a Buddhism enlightening sense rather than 2001 space odyssey type themes of transcendence of society or man kind.

As an example of things I have been studying thus far in preparation Waiting for Godot, King in Yellow, Kafka, certain fairytales such as the Shadow by HC Andersen, Notes from the underground, the tunnel, and stuff like that I guess.

1694725856.0,"People here seem to not quite understand existentialism, given the number of edgy posts that resemble teenage monologues.","This post was spurred by the following comment:

""That's why philosophical pessimism is superior to the nonsense that we can just create meaning out of thin air.

Not wanting to be exploited for mere survival is not being lazy. The contrary is what's delusional.""

It might not precisely seem like it means much of anything broadly, but I think it's representative of a common mistake made by those who are either new to existentialism and philosophy in general, or those who aren't in the best place mentally; seeking to remediate these feelings of dread, sadness, or loneliness by expressing them via an existentialist *font* so-to-speak.

The ""mistake"" in question is the fallacious assumption that you have ""got it"" and you have the ""right"" answers after breaking out of the ""ignorance"" that many people live their life within. I think it's also reasonable to portray a fair portion of this subreddit under those that make this mistake, take a moment to scroll through and you'll see what I mean. Flurries of posts essentially boiling down to ""I'm terrified what the fuck is happening?"" or (Read this with a gloomy tone) ""Everyone around me... just lambs to the slaughter... But I... I know what is beyond..."". The first one is a less intense expression of the ""mistake"" I'm pointing out, while the other is certainly a bit of a hyperbole, but nonetheless encapsulates the spirit of many posts that come through this space.

To begin understanding why I call this a ""mistake"" we should probably understand what Existentialism (The very subreddit these posts pop up on) even means. To put almost inappropriately simply:  Existentialism is a philosophical movement that focuses on individual  freedom, choice, and subjective experience. It asserts that people are free agents who must create their own essence and meaning in an otherwise indifferent or even absurd universe.

But notice how that definition *never* serves the prescription of what that meaning is or how it should manifest, only that we cannot say that we have ""The answer"" to existence.  Yet, A recurring pattern in this subreddit, perhaps even emblematic of a wider cultural phenomenon within philosophy, is the tendency to see existentialism as an endpoint rather than a process. To be clear, breaking free from conventional modes of thinking or societal impositions is not the culmination of existentialism—the terror, confusion, depression, or ego trip borne of existential dread is not the culmination of existentialism—it's merely the beginning.

To hopefully demonstrate in a neat package, as to why coming to this conclusion is parsimonious:

Existentialism is not a monolith but a living, breathing entity that beckons continuous engagement. It's a journey that begins, for many, with often misguided realization of life's potential  meaninglessness, or the shattering of preconceived societal constructs. Yet, it is only the first step on a path. It promises no ""escapes from the matrix"" that validates your depression, it does not promise clarity, but instead, it's a PERFECT tool to a deeper, more intimate dance with ambiguity.

Considering the comment that triggered this reflection, it underscores a classic predicament. The presumption that a stooped philosophical  pessimism holds a higher ground compared to other existential viewpoints appears to be a retreat into another form of certainty. And many who engage with notions of absurdity, or flirt with nihilistic tendencies, prescribe it solely as a philosophy of despair, misinterpreting the entirety of their depth and range. Like digging from one jail cell with a spoon into another.

The surge of posts that oscillate between desolation and an almost messianic sense of enlightenment signal an engagement with existentialism that's still in its infancy. I'm almost sympathetic though, as these are usually reflective of genuine turmoil or revelation, yet they miss the point that its a step up to expansion, and unfortunately go back to the same epistemic traps they so boldly claimed to escape. While it begins with questioning the established norms and confronting the void, it doesn't end there. Existentialism is not about wallowing in the abyss or  standing on a pedestal of newfound knowledge, looking down upon the uninformed masses. It's about navigating the space in between, continuously questioning, re-evaluating, and embracing the fluidity of existence.

This is not a doctrine of truth, or answers. I hope you can realize the shallow nature of mistaking the doomerpill fed to you by your depression, or existential angst, is a trap of its own.

I've read stories of people being ""clinically dead"" and all reporting a warm embrace, letting go of all emotion, complete calm and contentment. That's all well and good, but that to me doesn't constitute DEATH, idk it still seems like you're technically alive, just in a very low powered state, kinda like putting your computer to sleep. The closest thing I've ever experienced to death is a dream I had. Long story short, I got shot in the dream, and I remember just seeing the world fade, I blacked out, last thing I see is the perp looking at me with a scowl, and then I woke back up in the same location, but it was all white. All the people in the room with me who were going to be killed popped up too. We all just kinda felt relief, and I started thinking of the how sad the previous world was. Then I woke up. What do you guys think? Consciousness is so fascinating, it's just atoms working together to formulate whatever we are experiencing, and yet we have NO concept of what makes it all work. We have good ideas and theories, but really nothing that can be nailed down. It's up there with God imo. We fight back and fourth about whether God is real, and even the religious don't ""know"", hence faith. The people who have been clinically dead, say they no longer fear it, and I guess that's good for that initial fear of the process of death, but to me what comes after is truly the scariest and worst part. What is NOTHING? People say it's like before you were born, what does that mean? They are making it sound like you experienced nothing before you experienced life. No, you experienced life, you just were alive one day. So to say what comes after is like something you never experienced just makes no sense. I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.",1
1694794275.0,"Life was supposed to be meaningless, But...","&#x200B;

But If life was supposed to be meaningless, we all would have never given Consciousness by evolution and we all would be dead brain, just existing and doing our work till we die like all of animal kingdom (Tho most humans also work that way), you see animals don't need a meaning to their life cuz they are born with it. This post applies perfectly to all the animals in the world, except humans. Cuz humans have consciousness. 

In this way evolution cursed us to find our own meaning of life, right?

But still, evolution gave us consciousness, why? Think about it. 

Well, the literally answer here is to choose our own jobs, you see in our hunter gatherer world the jobs were going increasingly complex. Someone was a fighter, someone was a food gatherer. Someone was explorer. Someone was the cook and someone had to manage it all. 

So evolution thought of giving humans consciousness, so you know we can choose our own speciality and master in it, thus increasing efficiency. And this actually worked out for us. 

Now if you replace jobs with the meaning of life. Then you'll understand pretty quick that evolution gave us consciousness to decide our meaning of life. It's like existentialist philosophers said, Life is meaningless until we add our own meaning to it.

Or even simpler terms, Life got no objective meaning, just Subjective ones.",1

1694651697.0,Extreme Anxiety,"I'm basically just posting this to get my thoughts out of my head and (hopefully) for someone to see them and maybe relate to thisor offer some advice. It started when i was around 15, I'm 19 now. I started worrying about religion and afterlife and hell and the endless possibilities it could bring. I moved on from it until around a month ago, I took some weed which has sent me in to panic like this almost every time, so i had stopped. But I made the stupid decison that night to take some. When i did, everything i touched began to feel strange,like it was morphing onto my skin almost, then i began to think that for one reality, i had chosen what heaven and hell was, and went to my own 'personal hell' and had found my place in the universe as a strange cube like shape with strange feelings. Looking back, I believe that the strange feeling when touching things were some sort of sensory issue and that my personal hell was my anxiety mixed with how my room looked (the cube being my walls and the strange shape being my bed). 

After this night i decided to not take it again and still havent and dont believe i ever will, but it has left me with this anxiety. I have been diagnosed with anxiety by a medical professional so as is expected, this has sent me into a spiral of the meaning of life and death, the possibility of an afterlife and hell and the possibility of reincarnation.

I think my biggest worry is the fear of the unknown, as i expect is usually the common fear among everyone. I have began to understand that the present moment is all that we know we have and that the best way to go through life is to experience everything you can, learn from your mistakes and be the best person you can possibly be. 

The possibility of the afterlife is a comforting one to say the least, but not guaranteed. I believe that if there is a higher power, or a purpose to this life then a hell would be irrational and serve no purpose, especially not an eternal one. If we are put here for a reason i believe that reason is to learn and experience life, what comes after this we dont know which is all we know.

Although I have accepted that this is the best way to live life and that I need to embrace the unknown, I'm still struggling with the anxiety of what if im doing the wrong thing? What if I need to put God first if there is one? What if that deal i tried to make with the devil when i was drunk and 15 has condemned me? What if there is nothing at all?  

I would love to take comfort in a religion or belief but I want to accept that things will be how they are supposed to be, regardless of religion or belief. I hope that if there is a God/higher power, that he would not judge people solely on their belief in him, or reward and punish people based on the life they have lived because every person has different circumstances and the best way forward is to learn from mistakes, whether right here right now, or in the afterlife if there is one.

Sorry for making such a long post but if you have read this i really appreciate it. And if anyone could offer any advice on overcoming this constant fear i would greatly appreciate it as i feel that i am all alone in these thoughts and experiences. 

Edit: Thank you so much for all of your responses guys, they’ve really helped me with working through this stuff in my mind and i appreciate you all taking the time to read this and to offer your thoughts and advice. <3",1

1694576611.0,No fucking chance would infinite monkeys with infinite time and typewriters eventually type Shakespeare.,"They're never going to accidentally hallucinate 1600s English language and grammar and turns of phrase, as well as the associated socio-political milieu required to produce that language AND then randomly maintain Shakespeare's personal writing style for numerous acts and plays, all in a row? Without knowing what any of it meant because they're just mashing at the keyboards?

The only monkey ever who could come close was Shakespeare himself. So no monkeys in infinity ever, just one very advanced monkey outlier you can almost not call a monkey.

So ok ONE monkey stumbled on writing Shakespeare after millennia, when all typewriter monkeys collectively evolved into humans who abandoned the gift of infinite typewriters and chose instead to write with a fucking quill by hand the thing that supposedly, a monkey on a literal typewriter could literally randomly do according to the Monkey Theorem.

So not totally zero. One weirdo outlier in a universe of normals. So long as we we agree that “infinity monkeys” also means “whatever weird creatures monkeys develop into.” 

This hypothetical typewriter monkey without a typewriter outlier is so special, it should not be reduced to what monkeys can do. Shakespeare was unique and rare and odd and smart and sexy and fun and inappropriate. Flaunting the rules of society because he knew that they were only there to disguise the typical truth. Saying whatever he fucking wanted and fucking whoever he wanted because he was so much more than even infinite monkeys could smash out after being chained to a typewriter for the full infinity years. Even then, they wouldn't come up with what a human decided to change and do.

So. Now that we are unburdened by the conviction that we are unspecial monkeys (we are actually special monkeys and the typewriters are the psychological burden of of comparing ourselves to monkeys), what all do we want to do better and different and more enjoyably and inappropriately than everybody else? 

&#x200B;

We are only free as individuals if we maximize our unique human capacity to self-upgrade our monkey programming. Social, psychological, biological. We can decide to make Humans different. We are most human, least like monkeys, if we try a new weird thing that our instincts drive us to and/or based on our weird and unique brains, and modify our environments and genetics in less than one lifetime, and then tell people about it. 

The meanings of life are to Evolve and Protect the Hive. To step away from the typewriter and say FUCK THIS and go create a trajectory for yourself and your neighbors that improves on the pre-evolved way of doing things. Humans are programmed to do this, some more than others. Only when monetized is our creativity bad for our neighbors. We deserve to own our evolutions! We should not let companies pay us to create new and better versions of the world so they can sell it for too much.

We can hyperevolve as individuals and efficiently communicate with our neighbors about an option for them to improve their survival and the survival of their neighbors. 

We can all just go out, be whatever is right for us, learn about it and change it and test it out for survival, and get right back to you on if it improves our lives.  Other animals are to dumb to do this. Except maybe ants.

We're not a monkey hallucination. We're more like demigods who are only held back by our lack of ant-like community support.

I'm 28m and have been severely depressed most of my life. 

I have had a lot of life experiences, different jobs/careers, owned a small business, worked on farms, exercise pretty regularly, lived in different cities, have a decent amount of friends and dated different people. Nothing ever seems to make a long lasting difference and I firmly believe life is a joke and can not be fully enjoyed unless you are financially well off, the overwhelming majority of people whom are financially well off are born that way (I'll argue this to the bitter end, I've seen it first hand), I was not but am completely self sufficient and don't rely on anyone else. I am fully convinced that money does indeed buy happiness because it buys experiences and opportunities, without it life is just dull and a scrape, I work a ""good job"" right now and it's still nothing significant.

I have the semi unique experience(s) too of having a couple near death experiences, one were I fully went ""into the black"" and believe I was dead and one where I  was pulled into the ocean by a current that I couldn't see and nearly drowned but made it back to shore. The first experience has kinda outright left me with no fear of death because it appears to me that it's just like shutting off a light switch and nothing matters, it's kinda made me into a thrill seeker to be honest.

Anyway to get to the point of the title, I think it is selfish when someone's only response to suicidal thoughts is that they would miss you, I understand we're they're coming from and why they say it, but if a person is genuinely unhappy with their existence and the only thing that is offered for advice is that ""it can change"" or ""you can change it"" when all you've been doing is trying to change it and try different experiences with no fleeting success and only temporary relief at best, I honestly believe assisted suicide should be offered to everyone above 18 who wants it not just people who need it medically.

I don't believe meds are a do all-end all either I have nothing against people that use them and I have tried them myself but sometimes I think people just realize the bullshit of life and that's why they get so down, I'm not ignorant to the fact that many people in developing countries have it very bad, I've seen it in person too, but that doesn't invalidate ones own feelings.

Honestly I wouldn't even call myself suicidal, I just don't care anymore if I did die and have completely mentally checked out at this point, I'm sick of trying, the dream goal would of been a nomadic existence in a van or an RV with a small hobby farm and even the rich have ruined this for the average person, what a joke.",1

I get pretty frustrated over small things, like wanting the internet to work faster, dying in a video game, being concerned about what i say and do to make sure I am being almost unnecessarily respectful to my friends.. And yet its all because i simply want those things to go right. If I did not have those desires, I wouldnt get frustrated or fearful about such things. Then the next thing I know, I don't even remember why I was frustrated or anxious. This was especially the case in past intimate relationships, and I dont remember what we argued about, or why we broke up, but I decided to not date people anymore because of it. I was also thinking of giving up video games due to such frustration lol. Its as if I now desire to give up my desires.",1

This explains why time is an illusion, and why there is in fact only eternal things in reality (existence). We are living in a dreamworld, Anon. My guess is that the soul can only handle so much truth at once. So, fanciful and differing but similar dream sequences are created in the mind in order to comprehend it all, rather than all at once. Once it is understood, there is no need for the dreams. That is when Time ends.

1694258132.0,We are pudding,"( Assisted By chat GPT, Grammar adjusted as well as vocabulary, if you want to view the video, its in the end)  
Have you ever taken a moment to wonder if there might be more to humans than meets the eye? It's a bit peculiar, but let's embark on an enjoyable journey to explore this notion further.  
Consider pudding for a moment. It's soft, sweet, and offers an array of flavors. In a similar fashion, humans come in all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds. Our diverse experiences and the choices we make in life create a unique tapestry, much like the various flavors of pudding.  
But there's an interesting parallel here. Just as pudding has layers, so do our minds. Within us, there are different layers of thoughts and feelings. Some are readily apparent, like the creamy top layer of pudding, while others lie deeper, concealed from plain view. Similar to the way we scoop through pudding to discover its hidden layers, we can peel back the layers of our thoughts and emotions.  
Now, you might be wondering why we're drawing this comparison between humans and pudding. It's not merely for the sake of amusement. Instead, it's a way to illustrate that, like pudding, we humans possess both fragility and resilience. Life can be a bit like a spoon cutting through pudding — it can be tough at times. But just as pudding doesn't lose its sweetness when stirred or served, we humans have a remarkable ability to bounce back and adapt, even when faced with adversity.  
As we delve deeper into this idea, we'll explore the intricacies of human thought, the rich tapestry of emotions we experience, and the underlying connections that bind us together as a species. This journey promises to challenge your perspective on what it means to be human.  
So, let's maintain the simplicity and sweetness of this analogy as we continue to explore the playful comparison between humans and pudding. Get ready for an engaging and enlightening adventure into the heart of what defines us as individuals and as a species!

1694176233.0,Does immortality make anyone else uncomfortable?,"So for 3.8 billion years there was life which was always followed by death, always. It's just a 'natural' part of life and death is central and such a core part of our lives and the lives of every living thing on earth. But it makes me feel eerie and weird knowing that one day in the future there will certainly be a time where we achieve either immortality or be able to live for thousands of years. Especially as our technological advancements are increasing at an absurd exponential rate. We have barely scratched the surface and not even had our current technology for a couple of hundred years, look at how far we've come as a species, from cave dwellers and not having language to the modern man. From wooden boats and horses to F-22 raptors and Stealth bombers and helicopters. From apes that couldn't even talk to the James webb telescope, language, art, the ISS, quantum computing, rockets, genetic engineering, AI, Nukes, the internet, virtual reality, nanotechnology, coding, particle accelerators, tiny devices in our pocket that holds all known information in the universe; the list is endless.

Many scientists and futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, believe that in the next couple of hundred years we will reach some sort of immortality, whether it's digital immortality by scanning your brain and uploading your consciousness or biological immortality by being able to stop and reverse aging. There are hundreds of breakthroughs every year and billions of dollars going into these areas of research and every single day we're getting closer to achieving it. I 100% believe at some point in the future we will achieve immortality, if not, then will at the least extend human lifespan to be able to live for thousands of years.

It's easy to take the limits of our own vision for the limits of the world, as 1000 years ago if you predicted we'd have magic instant communication devices in our pocket and metal boxes that would take you to the moon you'd be executed for heresy or laughed at for being insane. But in reality it's easy to imagine that all humanity has ever achieved thus far, is but the dream before the true awakening.

It makes me feel uneasy knowing that death is something that faces everyone I know on earth right now, all my friends and family, death is something inevitable and looms over every one of our lives. But one day in the future death could just be a choice. It kinda makes me sad knowing that this colossal problem we all currently face and centre our lives around, will be laughed at in the future, they'll be in shock that humans only used to live around 80 years. It makes me feel small and question the fundamental questions of what is life, and what is death.",1
1694197450.0,What did you study? What do you work as? What do you do?,"I'm really curious as to what everyone is doing in their life here, are you studying something? Working? What do you do? 

I'm a first year philosophy student in my last semester and I've realized at this point that one of the only things that bring me pleasure in life is to sit in a philosophy class and listen to my professor talk, write my assignments and do my projects, of course I understand that might change in the future.

I'm taking three philosophy classes right now, the other two are psychology and an english course. I feel so complete, happy and fulfilled when I attend a philosophy class that I can't think of anything else I'd like to do with my life. 

But I really wonder, does anyone here study philosophy as a major? What's it like, to be an existentialist and study philosophy in post secondary? Or what do you work as?

And how exactly do you feel about it, how does it effect your work or school life?

Edit; sorry if someone's already asked something like this before. I question what I study at times but I get reminded of how great it feels to sit in class and listen and write so I really wanted to know if anyone else here feels the same way.",1

However, there was multiple occurrences which I would mention if you asked me what type of issues I'm talking about. I don't know the name of this or if it's just me, but this is how I would describe it.

I'm at a market with my family. I'm having a good time until a FLASH of thoughts like ""what happens after death,"" ""what's the point of life,"" and ""you're gonna die one day"" all comes into my head at once. My heart feels like it drops for a second and now beats faster. I have this emotion that immediately takes over me, but the closest word I can get to describe it is fear. I feel like I'm having a mini existential panic attack, but im not sure a panic attack would feel like this.

However, this all happens in just a few seconds, or even a minute or 2. This occurs multiple days.

1694143327.0,Why?,"I wrote this about a month ago. Sitting calmly just thinking for about 40 minutes. This is unrefined and me just getting my thoughts written down in my notes to clear my head, never intended to share, so it may not flow or come across exactly as I was thinking in the moment but I think you’ll get the gist. 

- I never tried to actually put this into words, 
The rock I threw rolls interacting with the forest floor, you can feel it vibrate along as it rolls, you can see what pine needles it brushes up maybe kicks up some dirt. It stops 
The forest floor surrounding me is covered in pine needles and some twigs and leaves and pine cones. And rocks everywhere strewn about but more likely than not they weren’t placed but happened upon this place naturally 

This is such a weird world we live in. It’s all taken for granted except for the parts unfamiliar to us like how many aspects of space baffle those uninitiated. As we’re all familiar with the earth and forests etc I feel it is all taken for granted

Let’s slow down. Remove humanity. The sun circles every day. Growing plants, providing warmth. Fast forward the sun watch it over weeks, months, years, spins really fast and plants grow alongside. But on a geological timescale still not much has happened. Eventually a volcano may erupt a tsunami may crash into shores whatever. The sun keeps moving the earth keeps spinning. It’s all on a completely different time scale than what we live on. I’m sitting here in this forest but 10,000 years ago and 10,000 from now this place will be absolutely certainly different but similar and the whole world will change but again in similar ways

What are these laws that govern how things change? The pace and all
Now it’s easy to trace spin back from star formation to planet formation and see what will and what has formed. Whatever. All that shows is the laws we have already defined and understand. I’m looking for deeper not just understanding that time flows forward and things change at different rates. I’m asking why

We know some fundamental things about how this universe works. Discs, spheres held together by forces like gravity. Understand forces like electromagnetism centripetal force, but why for any of it? We understand how all these forces work but why are they seperated?

Why does the rock actually hold itself together I understand the atoms are structured as so in a crystalline and I understand we can trace it back to it’s creation but why? I think I have to trace back from the rock to it’s planets formation to it’s stars formation. I want to see where the line ends. 

Why are these forces and laws in place governing everything? How different could everything be with any kind of alteration? Our entire understanding is a minuscule point of a vast sea of options. Our entire universe is a study one of one. We somewhat understand some things about our own but can we truly understand what’s going on without comparison or any context whatsoever 

Now diving back into it being weird, why do things form into spheres? Gravity? Why have we accepted this as understandable and normal? Of course a sphere would be perfect governed by these laws but why are these laws like that. Why is there order? Why do droplets if water form into a sphere? Why does any of it happen? Why are there atoms? Why do they attract eachother? Why do these forces exist? Why is it all happening?

I subscribe to the Big Bang or a variation possibly the multiverse too. But do they all have atoms? Or antimatter? Are they all the same basic building blocks? Where did those blocks come from? Why do we accept this as normal why is this normal? Trees are weird plants are weird but much much more weird is the whole thing working together. The universe from the stars to the dirt underneath my feet. Why is there anything at all? Shouldn’t the universe be a blank white space? Why is there dirt?
 Consciousness is extremely baffling and may actually be the answer to all my questions 

Who knows if we’re seeing anything as it really is? On the EM spectrum I know we aren’t but what else what hidden are we missing? Neutrinos sure. What if there are other forces acting on things completely undetected or undetectable. What if our detection all of our data is fake or skewed in some way?

Hard to work your way out when you don’t know what you’re in
Hard to find out from inside

Everything normal is taken for granted when in reality every single thing in this universe is profound

We distracted ourselves with society and it’s gone on long enough now that most have forgotten where they’ve come from unless they’ve rediscovered the true world doing what it does without our day to day lives interfering. 

Our day to day makes up what we are but it also locks us into a system just meant to keep pushing humanity forward to greater discovery and wealth for all

The little kids grow up just a bit and start families of their own, still kids at heart well into late age sometimes. Everyone has lived their own life  and is their own center. Watching from afar brings perspective into your own life

We drive around in automobiles most people not knowing a thing about them. We take our life our achievements and everything for granted and I think that’s how we push forward.

The most important questions to take away, questions I’d like answered
Why is there anything at all? Shouldn’t the universe be a blank white space? Why is there dirt?
Consciousness is extremely baffling and may actually be the answer to all my questions.
Everything normal is taken for granted when in reality every single thing in this universe is profound

Specifically the laws we’ve tried and tested and know to be true, why does the universe follow the pattern it does

Could it be part of the Big Bang? An explosion over time and we’re experiencing part of a minuscule pattern that emerges, like a few bubbles in a row or a lightning zig zag, I guess I’m asking why those things happen in the first place once again though. I’m not sure we can answer these questions",1
1694124276.0,The experience is what matters,"In the last months, I've been getting better from an anxiety-depression disorder and part of trying to get better mental health, I am trying to get a better framework for what is deal about our existence. I've been likeing and taking inspiration the idea of absurdism by Albert Camus (or at least why I understand about it).

So right now, I see the existence  intrinsically meaningless, but you can have a meaning born from your personal experiences, whatever they are good, neutral, or bad. The moments themselves have their real meaning, at least to yourself and to other people you share them with. Maybe this is a stretch, but also in the great picture those moments happened in an specific space and time and no matter how small they are, there is nothing in the universe that can change that (or at least for what we know). 

So, in some way, we create meaning in this meaningless universe by creating moments, following ambitions or ideas, communities, hobbies, art, and stories. Try to improve ourselves and our environment to the best of our abilities (with out punishing urselves) to discover new stuff and create new experiences and meanings that we couldn't experience before. And even if possible help to other people to have their meaning become a reality, and we should avoid to do ""bad"" stuff because it would mean to deprive other people from creating their own meaning in this universe.

1694054758.0,Why is there something rather than nothing? And why its amazing.,"This question has always stricken fear into my heart. The possibility of nothing existing at all. No one being able to observe reality. I can only consider myself lucky that reality allowed us to experience life.

However I think a mistake was made. Thinking that it was a probability based question. Meaning there was a probability that something existed and there was another probability that nothing existed. And we just happened to get lucky.

However the question seems a lot deeper than that. It deals with the most fundamental aspect of reality which created the universe, laws, consciousness and mechanism which allows us to be observers in this complex system.

The most fundamental aspect of reality in which everything is built from should answer the question. However it should also show why there was no other option. Reality was always going to be that way.

And just trying to grasp what that fundamental aspect of reality is seems infinitely out of reach. However the fact that we are here and everything turned out the way it is. Tells us that we were always going to exist and there was no way in which nothing at all would have existed.",1
1694028497.0,This is probably my final writing before I start looking for a psychologist.,"it seems that I could no longer contain this within me, this will be one large rant and probably my last one. An essay I guess is probably a word more appropriate to describe what you're about to read.

I must warn you in advance that what you're about to read is something that has been driving me to the edge for a long time, I hope it doesn't do the same to you.

But I digress. The topic, of this essay, is the complexity and cruel irony of life. 

We all search for meaning. Something to make us feel like we're worthwhile, like this life is worthwhile. Some of us find something that is enough to avert our eyes from the crippling thoughts of meaning and meaninglessness. Because meaning is subjective. There is no absolute law of meaning or purpose or reason for being.

Reality only exists in our heads. Did you know that you can't even perceive the colors you're looking at right now? We as humans cannot comprehend, with our eyes nor our brains, combinations of colors of more than 2. You think me a liar, go get 3 different markers. If you get anything, but brown. You're a 0.000000000001%. If you mix the core 3 colors - Red, Green and Blue - you get brown. Now I'm not saying to mix yellow, orange and some offwhite to get a lighter tone - therefore 3 colors I proved u wrong dumbass - No. Mix 3 core colors. So we cannot even perceive the world around us as it truly is. An insect is capable of observing 100m+ colors. Can you believe that? The beauty that we're incapable of comprehending... Such a waste... Anyway. 

The fact that reality is subjective and only exists in our heads is both something to be celebrated and lameneted. Simultaneuosly. Why? Because you can make your life anything you want. You can bend reality to be whatever you want it to be, all it takes is perceverance and mental capacity. You can build the reality you want to be in, you've all the tools. You want to be rich, in good shape and energetic all the time?The asnwer is quite simple, it hides in your head. In your subconscious mind, in your imagination. For example a way to get energy if you're feeling down. Imagine a moment where you were full of energy. Imagine it so vividly as if you're back. You'll get the energy from back then. You don't have such a moment? Neither do I. I make ones. Thru imagination. You bend reality. You get the energy you think you desire.

&#x200B;

**Desire**. Funny thing to think about. I read this comic - Sweet Home - a manhwa where parasites, that *\*SPOILER\** turn out to be our souls, trap us in our minds and give us all that we might desire. Every dream,  every goal, every ambition, every moment spent with a loved one, everything. And do you know what is at the end of desire? What happens when you achieve what you've set out to achieve? Futility. Futility is what  awaits us all. Hence the saying **Ralph Waldo Emerson “It's the not the Destination, It's the journey.”** it's climbing the mountain, not being at the top. There is nothing to do at the top. At the top is lonely. boring and cold. On the way up there's friends, there's camps, there's celebration for fails, for wins, theres fun. On the journey there's life. On the destination there's futility. How does one cope with it?

One finds another mountain to climb. Or suicide. No way around futility. 

But aren't our lifes futile either way? How you live? How you die? What meaning does it bear, to what end do we struggle and strive and be in pain for so long? Everything we create will rot and decay, everything we make will disappear and be forgotten. Our kids will wither and die, we will wither and die. The best of us will have their names echoe for centuries, but they will too be eventually forgotten. For example take the ancient civilizationsm. We all know they existed, but there's no real record of what they were or where they were. Just that they might have been at one point in time. No one remembers all those countless years of evolution spent building something.

At the core we're still animals all we want to do is find food, shelter and reproduce. Our hunting has just evolved, so that our senses become more dull and are more susceptible to mass manipulation. Because my friend believe me if 1 000 000 people simultaneously said ""My life is not worth 3k a month to barely scrape to pay rent and bills and await the next paycheck in anxiety of something breaking down."" If, just if - hypothetically - that amount of people woke up and decided ""No, this is enough."" it will be a disaster on a national scale. The sheep are guided by fear. Imagine 1 000 000 people  who have nothing to lose. Who have said 'What you have given me to think I might lose is nothing that I desire any longer, I want that which you're withholding from me. MY TRUE FREEDOM. AND I WILL GET IT ON MY OWN NOW!' That's what our governments truly fear. A mass of people capable of critical thinking with nothing to lose.

*"" You cannot strike fear into a man who has no one he loves*

&#x200B;

*You cannot persuade a man who wants nothing*

&#x200B;

*You cannot give hope to a man who has already given up*

*You cannot argue with a man who does not care*

&#x200B;

*You cannot defeat a man who has nothing to lose*

&#x200B;

*So be wary of the man who is empty and alone*

*For he has nothing to lose but everything to gain ""*

&#x200B;

We're drawing near to that end. As more and more of us end up alone and in the loneliness there is a piece of forbidden knowledge, accessible only to those who can survive in extreme solitary. That is above all the main objective of all the internet drama, news, every media... Diversion and propaganda, to silence the voice in our heads, to be used as jammers in the lonely nights. So the knowledge does not enter your head, but if you listen closely and ache in it you will get insight into so much that you've previously not even thought of. 

**The things you own, end up owning you. You need to let go, you're more than the sum of your urges.** At the end of the day who are you? You? Are you a sack of bone, muscle, fat and viscera? Or are you the individual experience compiled from everything you have been thru? What and who are you? Because you're neither your body nor your mind nor are you the combination of experiences that you have been forcefully thrust into. Then where does that leave us? Dangling over an edge on a bridge, called 'sanity' gazing into the raging waters beneath us 'madness', thinking ""Who am I?"" That answer I do not have. As I am sure most of us have experienced a moment in our life where we have had knowledge, previously never heard or learned anywhere, be accessible to us. In other words connecting with a greater source of knowledge. The majority of people have had at least one such moment. Where you've innately known something that you just couldn't have known, you didnt read, hear or see it anywhere. But you knew it. You connected with that source, even for just a limited amount of time, but you did outreach to something greater than you. Does that mean that we're not individuals, but parts of something. Cogs in a machine created by an incomphrehensible force? The force being god, whatever it is you believe in. I belive in chaotic ironic balance. Does that bring you solace?  To me it brings me distress. Knowing that I am created for no real reason to be a part of something I will never conciously grasp and be forced to play pretend in a theater that bears the name - society. 

Being a cog in a machine is for some people the dream. Some people like to be part of something else. To believe that they're part of something greater than themselves. Conciousness... That's the bane of it all. The sickening sense that you exist. We as people we don't really want to be beings, we just simply wanna be, but we cannot really be, because we strive constantly to disintegrate. Our self, tries constantly to disappear. Look beyond the veil of the most enjoyable activities in this life and realise they are the process of becoming unself. Sex, love, substances, alcohol... Even fun itself. Happiness is the process of killing self awareness... 

There's also the foolish belief that there's some combination of choices out there that will save you from who you are. That tomorrow you might wake up decide that you'll travel go to Parish, Prague etc.. That the new car will complete us, that a certain amount of cash will solve all our issues... It doesn't matter how satisfied your material urges are if you soul is diseased... With most of us our loneliness outweights our love with the gravity of a world.. We have more pains than comfortable moments, more regret than pride... How does the bad compare to the good in our life? The negatives are overwhelming. 

There's another sad aspect to this. You, the reader. There's a chance that you who is reading this have lived a life more comfortable than the vast majority of humans that have ever lived, yet you're here reading this.  And you're still unhappy. **What does that tell you about life?** 

How is this negative experience justified and worth it? A wanderer condemned to search for something he can never find... I have quite a bit more in me, but I will end it here. As I doubt anyone would bother reading further. If I went on I'd be writing a manuscript...

1693918135.0,How Does Anyone Cope With This?,"I've fallen into an existential depression. Whenever I think about the ""why"" of existence, I think about the very real possibility that there is no ""why."" If I try to turn to a higher power, I think about how if we're able to communicate with one, then that must mean it's on some sort of similar wavelength with us, therefore, that must mean that it also just comes up with its own meaning to its existence. Hope that makes sense.

Evolution suggests that all we do is survive to reproduce, propagating our genes for some unspecified reason. Religion tells us that we exist to serve some higher purpose that was arbitrarily decided by a god, and even then, does the god know why they exist? Would any answer that can be articulated through human speech ever be sufficient? 

I suppose that it's almost comforting to think that maybe existence in general is all meaningless, so anything that exists can create its own meaning, but for some reason, that just isn't good enough. It's scary to think that the things we do are all centered around keeping ourselves alive.

We eat, drink, find friends, find mates, reproduce, and sleep. When you think about it in the context of the natural world, it goes like this: find sustenance to stay alive, find a tribe to stay alive, reproduce so that your genes can continue, and rest so that you can do it all again the next day. Everything else in between just seem like permutations of those very basic instincts.

Why does an artist create art? They all seem to have their own reasonings, some of which seem pretty deep, but at face value, is it really just because they find the things they create to be nothing more than ""cool""? Almost everything I've ever been into, when you break them down into their most basic form, only drew me in because I perceived them as ""interesting"" and/or ""cool.""

I know this may be a lot, but I feel very alone in this specific way of viewing things. I know this is an existentialism community, so I know I'm not truly alone, but the feeling can be rather suffocating at times. I just want to be ignorant, and therefore, happy.",1
1693993310.0,"How do you see a significant other? (yes, I do have a reason to post about this topic here)","Obviously I don't expect us to give a shallow take. I have a cognitive dissonance on this one, as I often find it as something I cherish, but I came up with the idea that a SO is sort of the fakest friend/relationship possible, as I tend to prioritize any current gf over friends, family and acquaintances , and I'm okay and aware of that. In fact, I've brought up this topic with my gf as a mundane chat. My point here is that once we give a step aside, there won't be hate at best, and this is inherent to every situation/relationship to some extent. So it is sort of you're the most important person right now, the one that would leave me devastated if something bad happened to them, but I know a few weeks (months or years for some) after breaking up, I won't give a shit about you, and my friends being till the end is totally feasible, but even though I prioritize my current SO. This makes things pretty complicated, as I tend to overlay certain thoughts over my feelings. Thoughts like everything I feel is ""artificial"" or empty and meaningless, and I should never pass up any chance of something because I could break up with this person anytime soon and I'd be fine anyway.  One more thing that I can't articulate clearly, I would get over losing that person while being together, and this is the biggest cognitive dissonance ever, because how is there room in my mind for being so aware of the fact that the relationship is worthless in the long-term and at the same time I couldn't help but see that person as my only loved one forever if the ending of the relationship were other than our call?

I know I elaborated in a very weird manner, but the topic's there for anyone to comment.

1693580606.0,Update: Help on a moment I can’t understand,"So I posted on here not too long ago about an almost episode panic attack moment I had but I didn’t describe it very well, I described it as feeling insignificant and having a loud voice in my head but I just popped out the exact feeling I had that can finally tell y’all what happened fully, so y’all can maybe understand and shine some light

This is the explanation the best I can, bare with me:
Imagine doing something in the span of 4 seconds, but then it feeling like those 4 seconds are the longest moment of your entire life, that’s how I felt when I woke up that one morning, like I everything had slowed down to the point where the first of the 4 seconds, was like it was taking a lifetime to reach even a single second if counting. This is one of those things where it’s more a feeling so it’s very hard to grasp a explanation of it, but trust me as I’m trying my best, because I’ve had dreams with this feeling before years ago and I’ve finally gotten enough conscious to finally speak about it and get it off my mind. 
Almost as if time and time around it is going so strongly slow, and you feel every single thing around you, you are moving but you feel the time, the slowness, and it feels hopeless as you realize you are stuck here, moving slowly, 4 seconds has turned into years, 20 years in and you have only reached the 3rd second of 4 seconds, that’s the best I can explain it, and that’s how I felt that one morning waking up, panicking, a voice inside my head getting louder, and that’s the feeling I felt, please if anyone can even fathom what I’m trying to say, please, I’m all ears",1
1693530756.0,Existentialism and science,"Existentialism is a concept that I have always been intrigued by. A while ago Mathematics and Physics sparked a further interest in existentialism. My main talking points:

1. Interactionism.
2. The problem with applying physics to philosophy. 

According to science, everything has a cause. 
What is the relationship between the body and mind then? Given that the body is physical, and the mind is non-physical, how can they interact with each other?

How can something that is not physical interact with something that is physical? This is, as you probably already know, called the interaction problem. 

Some people conclude therefore, based on physics, that the mind is simply a product of the process of our brains - that choices simply are an illusion. That free will is an illusion, because choices are already pre-determined given that everything has a cause. 

Other people do believe that the mind and body are different substances, and still are able to interact with each other. Perhaps there is a bridge between the physical and the non-physical that enables interaction between the two. 

If you base your philosophy only on science, the study of the physical world, then you are likely to believe that everything is determined.

However, I think this is a wrong approach when it comes to existentialism. 

The way I view it is that we are here on earth as humans, just trying to make sense of our existence. To help understand the physical world better, we have science. 
However, science is inherently limited to our senses. Our perception of the world is only based on our senses and how our brains interact with that information. We can only perceive the world to a limited extent. 

When it comes to consciousness, science is unable to explain it. You can therefore say: “if science can’t explain it, it probably does not exist.”

I fundamentally disagree. As mentioned before, science is the study of the physical world. Consciousness is a concept that most think of as non-physical. We may not have physical evidence to support the concept of consciousness, but that doesn’t mean it can’t exist. 

We have created the notion of consciousness because we experience it. We make choices, we think, we have feelings which we experience.

Science can’t explain it with its current formulas and equations. In fact, it may even conclude that the consciousness can’t exist due to these formulas and equations. 

But I don’t think science should be applied to non-physical concepts. We created science which is limited. The world is so much more than we can perceive, including the non-physical. Some things just exist and lack of a physical explanation doesn’t take away the concept’s credibility. 

Therefore, I think that making philosophical conclusions based on only physics is the wrong approach.

I tried as eloquently as I possibly could, explain my thought process. I realize that there may be some flaws. Perhaps in my conclusions, or in my writing. In either case feel free to correct my mistakes. In fact, I’d highly appreciate it. I came here to be challenged and to improve my writing skills.

Specifically, I find the search for meaning itself to be pointless. Why does life, or anything in it, need meaning, why do people want a higher purpose or meaning of life so much that consider it a need? A lot of what I've found in existentialism (in this vein) focuses on finding your own meaning, or giving meaning to things, rather than going with societal norms for that meaning, but that's not what I'm looking for, that still implies that meaning is important, or that meaninglessness is a thing to find your way out of, when I see no need, abs have no desire for meaning at all.

Have you ever felt what it's like to have your entire essence and sense of being dissolve? I'll try to explain this to the best of my ability. Imagine this scene. You're laying on a patch of grass, you can feel the cool grass blades against your skin as you lay there, unmoving. As you relax and dive deep into your mind you no longer feel as yourselve. You're now the grass beneath you, the wind that blows, the leafs that gently rustle against one another... You feel connected to everything around you.. In that state I lose sense of reality and completely dissolve in feelings, shapes and forms that I have a hard time describing with my concious mind. The feeling of freedom, pure bliss, happiness and content is indescribable. I no longer feel as a separate particle, as a meaningless cog in a stupid machine, but as one with everything around me. The equilibrium I experience in that state is... I think I can compare that feeling to smoking weed, I guess. The best weed you can find, for a long period of time.

What I find hard to cope with is coming back from that state into this fucked reality that I must abide by. How do you cope with all this?

 I cannot enter that state if there are people near me, it is like their desperate attempts to shun the voice in their heads away prevents me from connecting with everything around me. As if they disturb my balance, jam my signal, my connection. The majority of time when around people I must remain hidden behind several masks to preserve myself, because I am able to, sadly, understand them on a very deep level. It is like their entire personality, problems, motives for acting the way they do. Everything. Is laid out bare for me to observe. Where the hatred and resentment of people might come from, why they feel that way, what made them lash out at that exact moment. By just looking at people's facial features I can discern the majority of their personality.  It is quite sad, because often I would try to understand people and show them that there's an easy way to feel at peace and be at balance with everything around you. You just have to remove all the jammers, to truly listen and to dissolve.

But the real problem comes there. Once you feel that feeling, that there is something beyond what we can comprehend as human beings, beyond what I could ever understand at this level of existence. How am I meant not to be suicidal when the prospect of death opens an indescribable amount of unkowns and it excites me so much...? 

I guess I'll just continue doing what I'm doing. Until the people around me are secure enough so I can finally lose my mind in peace...",1
1693500117.0,I am struggling with this,"I hate my own self-righteousness. 

I think my parents’ principles are inconsistent, irrational and antiquated. I think many of my generation’s principles are Hedonistic, lazy and cause a low attention span. I think many mental illnesses are not as tragic as mainstream media portrays, but are in fact a matter of low emotional intelligence and a low level of consciousness. Anorexia, for example (if this is personal to you and offends you, Im sorry), is caused by society. If one simply strips social expectations and constraints of their power through introspection and self-liberation, they become immune to this disorder. If one cannot do this, it is because their emotional intelligence and self-awareness is low. This is probably bad of me to say, in a lot of people’s opinions, but I truly believe it. 

Most of my closest friends consider me to be of utmost intelligence, wisdom, integrity, insightfulness and many other great qualities. However, when I assert unpopular opinions that I consider to be unpopular truths (such as those concerning the existence of objective morality, objectivity in art and aesthetics, politics, religion and other topics of philosophical controversy) I am often rightfully met with criticism. Criticisms such as elitism and self-righteousness. I truly believe I am better than the average person, and I do not believe it is bad for me to think that so long as it is justified. 

I do not abuse substances irresponsibly; I do not waste my time on TikTok; I read critically; I safely explore the world of psychedelia (fully conscious of the risks, being just 17 years old); I do not allow my moral, practical, educational, social or financial decisions to be motivated by ego, hubris, lust, envy, greed; I work my hardest and make no excuses due to laziness or weakness; I accept my flaws and try to work on them. I do so many things to be the best person I can possibly be. 

Is it truly wrong for me to think of myself as being above and superior to those who do not even try to do these things? Is it wrong to consider myself more morally righteous, intellectually strong and psychologically conscious than those whose principles and self-identity are defined based on racial and sexual prejudices; an economic class they were born into; institutional testimony from governments and churches; egotistical perceptions of themselves; the words of big names in mainstream media and the not-so-impartial evaluations of news stations and social influencers? 

Is that truly bad?",1
1693440658.0,Why I think a universe with a GOD is not something I want,"I'm a hardcore atheist.  But let's not discuss the truth or falsehood of God, but rather why I wouldn't even hope there is.

Religious people are often shocked to hear this.  Many people's conception of God lies solely within hope itself.

IF there is a God, one of two things MUST be true:

A) God was the start and created the universe and ethics themselves.  What is good and what is bad was solely upon God to decide.

B) What is Good and what is Bad existed as part of reality and God is bring those ethics with him upon his creation.

c\*) (updated 3rd option: counter argument #3 \[below\]) Ethics are human made.

Most religious people get defensive at B.  Probably because God would lose his title as highest power and be limited to constructs of the universe that made him.

Let's go to A.  God made it all including the concept of Good and Evil.

Now we have a universe that some egotistical unknown entity ""decided"" what actions you take are correct and which are incorrect.  You have been enslaved by this God.  You may have free will, but you will still face his judgement and incorrect actions will bring you eternal horror.

Who in their right mind asks to be enslaved?

I am free.  I just deal with the existential dilemmas of nihilism, but I am free.

Hoping for God is hoping for enslavement.  A king that sets the rules and takes away our freedom.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 8/31:

Ok I can't keep up with all the replies, but I've noticed they all say one of only a couple things So I'll get ahead of some of these arguments....

1. If you use the bible or bible verses, I counter with quotes from Harry Potter to prove that wizards are real.
2. ""I have a limited view of God and what that means"".  If God has so many definitions, the word GOD is useless.   Here's a word, ""nslkdnfoe"" I made it up and its super hard to pronounce.  Its definition is anything you subjectively want it to be.  Should we add it to the dictionary?  No, because words are sounds that convey ideas from one person to another.  If a word has multiple fluid meanings, its useless as it is not a sound that conveys an idea from one person to another.

When God was shown NOT to be a dude on a cloud (we created in his imagine) he just became more abstract and heaven was in the cosmos.  We checked he wasn't there so now Heaven is another ""dimension"".

I'm not interested in chasing God into the semantics of the metaphysical.  That's just human thought and word play.

By God I mean:

A. monotheistic

B. It is an entity

C. it is conscious

D. It had something to do with the creation of our reality

*\*\*I'm letting us off the hook on ""god creating humans in his image"" since we proved that false way beyond a reasonable doubt with evolution.  Also its paradoxical as we no longer view God as a dude on a cloud.  So if he's abstract we were obviously NOT created in his image or we would be abstract interdimensional everywhere all the time floating looking things.   So I'm generous here and not using that in the definition.*

&#x200B;

3. Ethics are a Human construct.

Well, if God dictated the reality mechanics, its his construction.

If he allowed us to navigate freely with free will and we just came up with the system of morality, we will still have to settle for his decision of what afterlife is.

If God simple created us and walked away from the universe, that's within my definition as well, however, at this point whether I live in a universe with or without God seems to have no different outcomes.  In which case, I'm still justified in picking the universe without God, cuz the choices are equivalent.

&#x200B;

PS, I've done things Id consider bad, not evil, but I've made mistakes.  The parental God did not scold me, or do anything that I could see.  He doesn't talk to me.  If he's real, he's so quiet I can't see the difference with or without him.

People tell me I'll see when I get to the afterlife, but I've noticed almost all (I think all) of those people are people that are not dead so could not know.  So I'm having trouble trusting their call.

It is not possible for one to ""make"" another person feel an emotion. One can facilitate, motivation, guide, teach, bully, or encouage one to have an emotion, but no person can make another person feel. What is the difference between make/force a person to feel an emotion verses encourage, guide, or teach an emotion?

1693465823.0,Maybe stop over-asking/thinking about meaning/the point/reason of something/doing something/being somethings is a good thing for you.,"This is what I think: to seek meaning/point/explanation/justification/significance of doing/being something is a psychological mechanism to makes you feel good/confident/significant about the thing that you want to do/to be. This is part of human nature, but keep in mind that this function is influenced by many factors, and sometime the outcome could come out cheap. Some examples I could give is the people who gives their life to their countries or religions in the old days (or current days), because countries and religions are ""good-enough"" reasons to justify their actions and choices. Or evidences are ""good-enough"" to suggest that those women are witches in the Middle-Ages. Nazi and communist or capitalism propaganda are convincing-enough to their followers, etc..  


See what I am doing here? I just want to point out that human is a reason-seeking creature, even the reasons are sometimes poor. And probably people seek reason not because they are clever, but they are vulnerable for them.

Another suggestion that I would give, is to not consider your mind/brain, language and logic are sufficient enough to give you reason of doing something. In other words, just don't sit at sofa and think what is actually worth doing in life. I have that experience, and I am sure a lot of you did. ""Oh.. just give me a reason, or something worth doing, I will devote my whole life to it"". 

I believe that you do things because you do things (if more explanation needed, go to neuroscience), I would say you don't need to convince yourself or other people with ""reasons"".

Another interesting thing I notice and experience, is that ""well but I don't know what to do?"" This question alone is fun, I would say this is multi-factorial. I don't have an answer, maybe there are so many choices? Maybe we are smart and skeptical, so that we won't devote to anythings easily? Maybe there are so many entertainment in life, we need some abstinence for ourselves in order to gain motivation again? I don't know, but we have time to figure it out.

Maybe the most cruical thing that I really want to say is, understand yourself, understand the ""seek-reason"" mechanism that you have, accept it, use it, but don't think it is the ultimate perfect mechanism and suffer when ""that thing"" couldn't give you answer to/in life, and feel lost in own mind.

1693431293.0,Why Why?,"\*Quick update on the people thumbs downing this.  I love when people can't argue the logic, they just ""don't like it"" so they dislike the comment.  Such a strange way to exist only believing what you'd like.

&#x200B;

Words are used to denote a concept or idea with a sound so we can translate that concept or idea to another person.

Many people seem to lose this principle when they start reflecting deeply.

WHY?  What is the definition of this and WHY is it the question asked so often.

""why?"" in regards to the universe really has no more validity than asking the color or flavor of the universe.

If I ask why something happened, the ultimate answer will bring us to the ""first cause"", the big bang or beginning of the multiverse or whatever.

I've found that most people using this question mean one of two things or a combination:

What was the intention?  or What was the initial cause?

To ask the intention is to already assume a god-like theory as non-conscious objects have no intention.  So without God, intention is a meaningless question.

As to the first cause, this becomes fairly ambiguous.

First of all God cannot be proved to be the first cause simply because of the rule, ""everything needs a first cause"".  For example, If there is not God, how did the universe start.

This is paradoxical and a self-defeating argument.  If the rule is everything needs a cause, then God needs a cause and could not be the first thing.  If God doesn't need a beginning, then why did you say everything needed a beginning and thus we don't need to tag on this God-theory because now the universe CAN have started itself or lasted forever.

The words ""Why"" and ""God"" are meaningless as everyone has their own idea of what that word means.  And as I said to being with,

words are sounds to communicate particular ideas.  If that sound no longer functions as a communication of a an agreed upon idea, the word is now just a sound with no meaning.

&#x200B;

Why is this?  Just cause.

&#x200B;

\*Fun addition:

The universe has no meaning and no purpose if God does not exist and therefore these questions also do not need to be asked.

What is meaning/purpose?  They are similar to intention, but more than that, in order to ask the question of the meaning of the universe, one first has to assume the universe is NOT real.

Why did I say that?

What is meaning?  Well we often talk about meaning of something like a book, play, work of art, movie, or some off handed remark that ""meant"" something other than the literal words used.

This means that the direct literally reality of the thing to which we want to apply meaning, is only a representation of the ""true thing""

What did ""2001 Space Odyssey"" mean?  Well it was about a plot of humans traversing space, but the author meant it as a comment of the transcendence of the species, as an example.

So, what does our universe mean?

Well, nothing.  It is real.  It is the literal objective reality.  There is no plot behind it.

So non-religious philosophy has little reason to ask:

the meaning, the purpose, or the ""why"" of the universe as these questions have no ""meaning"" to begin with that is applicable to the situation of reality.

Long answer: 
If there was a meaning, who says you would you be able to live up to it? Let's say there's inherent meaning to life: let's say you're objectively born to do x. If theres was a punishment for not doing it, that would mean you would have no freedom to do whatever you want. You'd only be happy if you COULD and WANTED TO live according to the meaning of life. These are two conditions that would need to align. Of course, if there was no punishment for not living according to the meaning of life, then it wouldn't matter and you could just do whatever you want.

I understand that this subreddit is full of people suffering from uncertainty, confusion and depersonalisation, but it is natural to feel these kinds of things. It's okay not to know the truth. I know that the anguish of not knowing is due to a lack of control in our day-to-day lives, and I think that leads us to focus excessively on ourselves, on our identity as something that can be ""significant"" or ""important"".

The mistake is to forget the roots from which we spring. We are nothing without the environment from which we are nurtured and relate. The world is our context, it creates and guides us, it is everything to our subjective experience! We cannot imagine alternatives to life itself then. If we already understand that we are part of a big system on a universal scale, we will see that our life is just a small cog.

Everything we have (computers, sofas, education, hospitals...) is a product of society, not of ""human beings"". We are not superior because we know more than other animals, but because of our ability to communicate, which has allowed the cumulative abstraction of very complex concepts. Our burden as an individual is small, life did not give us the ability to rise above our nature. A protozoan is not so different.

Is this bad? No, it is neither bad nor good, as we cannot discern it; we cannot imagine alternatives as our life is subject to this inferiority as a way of life.

We exist and some of us are afraid to die because of the unknown of what happens to consciousness after death. Some of us, for that reason, dont want to die but if you live then you will question it and be terrified. But reality makes us live and die, so we have to experience both. Nature has laws/mathematics that we can't even understand fully. We create our own language of logic and math to try to use laws of nature to solve problems but we can never know why it is. There is no way to prove axioms like 1 + 1 = 2 because the only way to prove it is with mathematics and mathematics is made up of axioms, we just discover it and accept it but never know why and yet it governs us and literally everything we do.

1693002482.0,Embracing Life: Letting Go of Existential Overthinking and Living in the Present,"

In a world where information is at our fingertips and possibilities seem endless, it's easy to fall into the trap of overthinking, especially when it comes to existential matters. Existential pondering often revolves around persistent thoughts and questions about the meaning of life, reality, and one's existence. While seeking answers is a natural human inclination, it's important to remember that dwelling excessively on these questions can hinder us from fully experiencing and enjoying the present moment.

As human beings, we possess incredible minds capable of profound contemplation. However, this gift can turn into a burden when we get caught up in a cycle of endlessly analyzing the nature of reality. It's true that we are complex beings with intricate neural networks, yet our existence extends beyond the boundaries of our minds. Life happens not only within our thoughts but also in the experiences we share, the emotions we feel, and the connections we make.

Rather than getting lost in a labyrinth of hypothetical scenarios and alternative realities, we must recognize the value of embracing the one reality we have - the life we are living right now. Life is a blend of pain and happiness, challenges and triumphs. By fixating on abstract questions, we risk missing out on the simple joys that are right in front of us.

The allure of seeking answers to existential questions is understandable, but there's a time and place for everything. Constantly ruminating on the mysteries of the universe can prevent us from engaging in the world around us. It's essential to strike a balance between introspection and immersion in the present moment. Instead of allowing existential pondering to dictate our thoughts, we can choose to live with intention, pursuing experiences that bring us fulfillment.

One potential reason for succumbing to the clutches of excessive existential thinking is the comfort we find in our own minds. In many parts of the world, individuals are preoccupied with basic survival, making existential contemplation a luxury they cannot afford. This contrast highlights the privilege of those who have the freedom to explore such questions. However, this privilege should not become a hindrance. It's vital to acknowledge our blessings while also recognizing that excessive contemplation can lead to unnecessary suffering.

The key lies in actively participating in life. Engaging with our surroundings, forming connections with others, and pursuing our passions can offer a sense of purpose that counters the grip of existential pondering. Instead of allowing our minds to spiral into unending analysis, we can channel our energy into creative pursuits, personal growth, and meaningful interactions.

In conclusion, while existential questions are an inherent part of the human experience, it's important to strike a balance between introspection and living in the moment. We have the capacity for deep thought, but we must not let this gift rob us of the joy of living. The pursuit of answers should not overshadow the pursuit of a life well-lived. By embracing the present and actively participating in the world around us, we can free ourselves from the chains of excessive existential thinking and truly experience the beauty of life.",1

1) this is my first time on this subreddit.

2) Im 17 years old and NOT a fucking ancient philosopher who somehow digested centuries of research covering belief.

3) I expect to be criticized in both nice and harsh ways. I accept that and even invite that.

4) I'm still working out and discovering my beliefs everyday, which means some of this could be foolish or purely incorrect. If thats so, that doesnt mean i'm retarded, it means I haven't happened upon the information I need to accept the idea was foolish.

Let me explain my current beliefs. I view myself as an existentialist. I don't view myself as this because I think I'm cool or I think it makes me unique. No good has ever come out of trying to have an existential conversation with other dumbass highschoolers in my grade. I view myself as an existentialist because I believe that there is no inherent meaning to life or existence. I do, however, believe that meaning can be somewhat internally and temporarily found through the discovery of passion. I believe that the discovery of this 'passion' is not inherent either.

This universe is extremely confusing, absurd, unfathomable and lacks instruction (a clear objective). I despise the many mysteries and unanswered questions that the universe dangles in front of my face as I beg to fall asleep. I hate that I don't have access to the truth of why everything is the way anything is. Why nothing was apparently something before everything. For some time this made me so angry that I turned to nihilism. I was younger and even MORE uneducated on that matter than I am now, and I just wanted to reject the idea of meaning in the most brutal way I could. I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle it. Yet, eventually my mind found some ease. I realized that these questions are and will forever be unanswered to me - to everyone.

So wait what about the almost revolting title? Im fucking getting to it...

For most of my life, my grandparents on my mothers side were fantastic. They were such lovely people that only cared that I grew up happy. Eventually, both of them got a little too old. They both had heart attacks and multiple strokes, but they survived. It was hard for me and my brother to cope with how sudden this was. At the beginning of summer, my sophomore year I believe, we visited them and had the most wonderful time. By the end of summer, we weren't sure we would ever see them again. We never even got to see them much before, other than occasional talks on the phone, because my mom wasn't exactly terribly close to them.

Holy shit I'm getting there. Bear with me...

Eventually they were back in somewhat okay health. No visits were on the horizon, but they were able to start calling to talk. Immediately, the only thing they would ever do now was preach their lord and savior Jesus Christ. I would tell them about my fantastic day that I had at school and how I had gotten an A on the project I was so stressed about... they would attribute MY success to god and then carry on telling me about how when I die there's gonna be some eternal guy whos like ""Did you see that, I did that shit"" and i'm gonna be like ""Huh, see what? Who are you?""... ""Im God. I just crafted that entire storyline you followed. Your welcome"". Piss off. Please excuse my apparent aggression, this is just me releasing my current contemplation through my fingers and into the keyboard. And yes, I know that's a complete mockery of what different religions believe happens at the end of the line... apologies. The point is that I refuse to attribute anything I do to some God we 'have faith' exists. I create my existence and choices.

My grandparents are afraid. I hate how harsh this sounds when I type it, but this is what I believe. My grandparents brushed death. Life snapped its fingers and both of them realized that in a moment's notice they wouldn't exist anymore. Life will be OVER. Everything they have done is definitive. Everything they do from now on is the final strokes of the pen on the final page of their story. So they panicked. They clung to anything that would disprove that this is the end of the line. They turned to mankind's distraction, religion. Now life isn't over, it's simply reaching its next supposedly eternal chapter. It's a religion that provides a fake sense of internal satisfaction.

Please, please, please continue to understand that this isn't backed by any Q&A with my grandparents. It's simply my hypothesis. My belief. I don't agree with the way religion allows you to pretend it's all under control. It isn't.

In conclusion here. I invite ridicule or agreement with anything I said. Its like 10pm where I am and I spent the whole school day listening... not to the teachers... to my thoughts. these are those thoughts.

1692866904.0,Is anyone else's hi-spiritedness just dying off with age?," 

I think mine comes and goes in cycles, but it seems like the older you get the harder it is to even engage in any sort of escapism because adulthood aside, seems like the highness factor wanes off in a lot of things we typically indulge in be it long drives/cruises around town, sex, video games, birthday parties, vacations, even something as compulsive junk food starts to feel like a chore rather than something you do for a mere guilty pleasure

A lot of us like to play-pretend with enjoying our lives, I think this is to avoid existential dreads about what are we making out of our lives

But I feel like with age and with the changing times, life becomes more bleak and soulless, but the question then becomes is this because we start to see life more for what it is and don't engage in this wishful thinking about life and the highest hopes for the universe like we once did or is this a product of gaining more intellectual curiosity and philosophical prospects of life over time?

Either way, this is a natural consequence of us humans extending our life expectancies, I feel like the longer we live, the more we get into existential abyss about what's all to be

Back in the days before industrial society we were more focused on surviving and actually living life rather than just trying to fill in the void with mundane tasks from civilized society

I would observe my immediate surroundings, enjoying the feeling of falling down into my body. Those were innocent times, a time of kindness and curiosity, untouched by anxiety or worry. My soul was brimming with curiosity, eager to explore the vast world that lay ahead.
There was so much to discover. Hours would slip away as I watched ants and other bugs on the ground, observing bees as they went about their busy work. I was gentle, never stung, enamoured by colours, captivated by flowers and trees. Freedom was mine, and happiness a constant companion.

But then came the moment when I was told, ""No."" Don't touch the bees, they warned, or you'll get stung. Avoid dirt, they cautioned, or you'll fall ill. In an instant, innocence gave way to suspicion, concepts I had yet to grasp. I was told I wasn't important, pushed toward the chains of obedience, shown a world of religion and punishment. My freedom slowly eroded, and I was left with the notion of being trapped, surrounded by unseen demons, the ones they made me believe in.

Leaving home in search of independence, I thought I'd reclaim my freedom. Yet, society too held its own demons. The concept of masculinity, feminism, borders, racism, body image, religions, classes, money – the list grew endlessly. Walls arose around me, constructed from fear of hurt and loss, confining me from the world beyond.

Yearning for that lost innocence, for freedom and exploration without anxiety or suspicion, I've devoted my life's remainder to the pursuit. I strive to dismantle these walls, to release the demons instilled in me. Naive? Perhaps. But I'll treat all with the best intentions, granting trust without the need for its concept.

This is me letting go, tearing down barriers. Whatever may come, I am prepared. If I'm hurt, then this world wasn't meant for me. Society, it's your failure, not mine. So if you encounter me, extend your best intentions. Who am I? I am everyone and everything. I am you.",1

We try to convince ourselves that we are meaningless and everything is either meaningless or God’s Will; never accepting our responsibility to create a future we can all survive. 

We are failing evolution to entropy because we prefer to live as psychopathic feral animals rather than be domesticated in Life to fulfill our design in playing out roll in growing and assuring the continuity of Life in perpetuity.

We together form an embryonic Singularity for an embryonic Universe, and we collectively say “Fuck That.” 

We have one evolutionary instruction that makes completing this evolutionary transition automatic and everyone knows it whether they choose to acknowledge it or not; “Be kind and take care of each other.” 
Never yet since Nature evolved us up and we have had the responsibility to create our future have we followed that instruction. 

7000 years of religions, revolutions, and even science, we have never learned to quit using war and slavery to subsidize our lives and luxuries. That’s what will be the cause of human extinction when this pregnancy comes to full term, and this limited trial offer at life concludes. It is up to us to create our future, and it cannot be created through psychopathic behavior.

""We can take a moment now and then to consider where we are and where we would like to be. It is these moments of stepping back, and looking at our lives, that can help us clear the fog and choose a path forward. But which path?""

""We tend to think we know what makes us feel fulfilled, what is good for us, and what is bad for us. No one knows us, we think, quite like we know ourselves. The problem is we’re so good at being ourselves, we don’t always see that there might be another way.""

Shunryu Suzuki: “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few.”

Lesson 1: LIVING AN EXAMINED LIFE
""Asking honest questions about ourselves is the first step toward recognizing that we may not be experts on our own lives. When we accept this, and we accept that we may not have all the answers, we step into the realm of possibility. And that is a step in the right direction.""

Lesson 2: IN PURSUIT OF SOMETHING BIGGER
""Some of us have lived the majority of our lives and find ourselves looking back, others have most of our lives in front of us and are looking forward. For all of us, regardless of age, it helps to remember that the question 'Do I matter?"", of leaving something for future generations and of being part of something bigger than ourselves, is not just about our personal achievements—it’s about what we mean to other people. And it’s never too late to start now and leave a mark.""

Lesson 3: FILLING IN THE GAPS
""Good relationships keep us happier, healthier, and help us live longer. This is true across the lifespan, and across cultures and contexts, which means it is almost certainly true for you, and for nearly every human being who has ever lived.""

Lesson 4: THE NEED FOR RELATIONSHIPS
""We are born with a need to connect with other people. Because this need for connection is fundamental to a flourishing life, social fitness should be taught to children and be a central consideration in public policy right alongside exercise, diet, and other health recommendations.""

Lesson 5: ADVERSITY ON THE PATH TO THE GOOD LIFE
""Thousands of stories from the Harvard Study show us that the good life is not found by providing ourselves with leisure and ease. Rather, it arises from the act of facing inevitable challenges, and from fully inhabiting the moments of our lives. It appears, quietly, as we learn how to love and how to open ourselves to being loved, as we grow from our experiences, and as we stand in solidarity with others through the inevitable string of joys and adversities in every human life.""

A FINAL DECISION 
""How do you move further along on your own path toward a good life?
First, by recognizing that the good life is not a destination. It is the path itself, and the people who are walking it with you.
As you walk, second by second you can decide to whom and to what you give your attention. Week by week you can prioritize your relationships and choose to be with the people who matter. Year by year you can find purpose and meaning through the lives that you enrich and the relationships that you cultivate.
By developing your curiosity and reaching out to others—family, loved ones, coworkers, friends, acquaintances, even strangers—with one thoughtful question at a time, one moment of devoted, authentic attention at a time, you strengthen the foundation of a good life.""",1
1692505759.0,coffee and life,"🌟 Embracing Happiness and Letting Go of Existential Doubt 🌟

Dear friends,

Today marks a significant chapter in my journey, one where I choose happiness over the endless maze of existential ponderings. It's easy to get lost in the labyrinth of life's unanswerable questions, to be consumed by thoughts that only seem to lead to more uncertainty. For far too long, I found myself entangled in this web of introspection, searching for a meaning that seemed elusive.

But here's the realization that has set me free: life is too fleeting to be weighed down by the burden of questions without answers. The very nature of our existence is a marvel, and while we may never fully unravel its mysteries, it's the beauty of the journey that truly matters.

I've made a conscious decision to break free from the chains of existential dilemma. I choose to focus on the present, on the laughter shared with loved ones, the moments of joy that light up our days, and the simple pleasures that make life worth living.

It's liberating to accept that there are questions beyond our grasp, and perhaps that's where their magic lies. Just as the cosmos holds its secrets, I've come to acknowledge that some truths may remain veiled until the end of times. And that's okay. For in the grand tapestry of existence, we play our part, embracing the unknown with open hearts.

Some philosophers, while offering insights, can inadvertently become viruses for the mind. I've come to understand that it's more enriching to live a life filled with experiences than to spend it endlessly seeking the ""why"" behind those experiences. The pursuit of happiness and growth, the laughter, the tears, the shared moments — these are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives.

And as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, I'm reminded of the simple joys that await each day. I'm grateful for another chance to participate in the exhilarating game of life, to savor its tastes, sights, and sounds. This perspective only becomes clear once we shift our gaze and view life through a different lens.

So here's to a future filled with happiness, to cherishing every sunrise and finding wonder in life's smallest details. Let us lift the weight of the inexplicable from our shoulders and savor the journey for what it is — an extraordinary adventure that defies easy explanation.

With newfound clarity and a heart full of optimism,

1692401608.0,The Temporality of Consciousness and the Continuity of Existential Experience ( Self written idea),"*I have been working on a theory of mine for the past months that I feel like i finally solved. If there is any critique, please let me know. This is my first philosophical work I have ever written.*

**The Temporality of Consciousness and the Continuity of Existential Experience**

The perception of time, as Kant might argue, is an intrinsic part of our human experience. Our entire life is based on clocks, dates and calendars. However, as you might know, our perception of time changes when we are less aware or when our consciousness ceases. Consider a dreamless sleep, where many hours can feel like a few minutes passing. Might this feeling of time passing be even faster in the absence of consciousness all together?

**The Instantaneity of Existential Transition**

Building on the idea that time feels different or even instant when we are not conscious, there emerges an interesting idea about the continuity of consciousness. If a consciousness cannot perceive its non-existence due to its absence (of existence), then any subsequent revival of such consciousness, irrespective of objective time passing, would be perceived as instant. As a thought experiment, say that the chances of a consciousness re-emerging after death are near infinitely small, and say that it takes an near infinitely long time to happen, for the experiencing consciousness that ceased, it would feel instant. A councious being can only be councious, because it can simply not experience not being councious, thus making existence eternal. 

This explanation does not claim validation, because it treads on grounds that modern science cannot measure or proof. Instead, it's asking us to think deeply about the mysteries of life, what it means to be conscious, and how we experience time. By asking these big questions about life, death, and time, we get new ideas about the ongoing journey to understand ourselves.

*I hope anyone found this interesting, it was very fun to bring my thought on paper!*

1692426466.0,Mortality,"I (24M) have struggled with my own mortality since I was around 8 years old. I don't know what triggered me to start thinking about it so young. Before I would get deathly afraid of the thought of it. I would be absolutely terrified, in my bed, not being able to shake the thought of it out of my head. I would start coddling myself and holding my head in fear as if it was right around the corner. It was like that for a while. More recently though, I've been thinking more about the absence of life rather than being dead. I was scared of the inevitable (and still am from time to time) but it's more rather about not being able to experience anything anymore. When I'm dead I won't be worrying about anything, because I can't.   


I guess I stems from worrying about not living a fulfilling life? I wouldn't know the deeper psychological meaning of why I think this way, though I'm sure most have had a thought about it from time to time in their lives. But I am constantly thinking about it. As I said before I used to be extremely afraid of it but I got really annoyed that I was living in fear almost every day and something changed. I realized the moment it changed but now I can't remember what clicked. From time to time I still get afraid of it but now it's more relaxed or worried thoughts. I don't know man.   


Another odd thing is, nowadays whenever I get into bed to start to go to sleep, that's when I think about it, without fail. I don't know what it is about the bed that gets me there every time. The correlation between sleep and death? The fact that it kinda feels like I'm being placed in a casket? I really don't know.   


I've tried to see what I could do about these thoughts, on and off for a little while now and I think I made a huge breakthrough with swithci9ng from fear of it, to the worries, but there's still some further part of it that I still don't understand. I know I won't be able to completely get rid of these feelings but I want to be able to try and understand them more. I don't want to get to the end of my life, not having thought about it, and then come to the realization I'm going to die soon, and go kicking and screaming. Who the fuck wants that? I know I don't. I've met people and seen people who claim they have either overcome the fear of death to the fullest extent we possibly can, or at least found some kind of peace. Either they've found a revolutionary way of dealing with it that comes with age or certain experiences, or they are all just lying. I really hope its the former. I I really hope I can get there one day. We all will march through the gates of life to the eternal beyond, whatever it is. I'm no different form every single living being in the history of the universe. Everything has and will die. I just want to be able to come to some kind of terms with it.

Of course, nihilism isn’t too far of a walk from existentialism, but it doesn’t necessarily have to lead to that.

Time has passed... It is 2023, I am at least 20 years old. In quiet moments I often think deeply about the consequences of being alive, that is when I realistically imagine death and that well of infinite human incompleteness. When I remember my age, it gives me a wake-up call; it whispers to me the uncertainty of my lived days.

Why am I alive, why am I conscious? There are people who talk about the meaning of life, which is an explanation for our survival in the world. The truth, I believe, is that ""meaning"" is a human construct that is either meaningless in relation to objective reality, or so distorted that it does not even touch the logical characteristics that define the universe.

Why are we so far from the truth? Heh... When I hear people say that happiness is the meaning of life, I can't help but feel a mixture of sadness and indignation. It's like I don't understand the reasons that make them feel secure in their hedonism. It makes me wonder, are people aware of their nature? I really don't think so. 

We are not aware of how enormously influenced we are by evolution and its biology. To exemplify, we tend to see the world as a large-scale lego, where we presuppose that the concepts we conceive of are rigid and superimposable. When I look at a person's face, I can see the uniformity of the whole and recognise it as such, but the reality is far from what we perceive. Underneath that face is a coordinated set of fluids, muscles, bones, cartilage.... In a different conformation, we would see a very unpleasant image that would unleash contrary and terrifying emotions.

Emotions (such as happiness or fear), colours, space, time, etc., become perceptions that have an impact on us. They become perceptions that make evolutionary sense, but which we normalise as something that has always ""been there"".

There are also people who tend to abuse metaphysics, thus speaking of infinity or finitude, which is why some end up in nihilism... It can't be that simple. We are not timeless beings; we do not understand the magnitude of the problem if time (and space) is the means by which we instinctively reason EVERYTHING we imagine. We cannot suppress time in order to put an end to paradoxes that make us believe that the universe is infinite.

It is not about having the answers, but about being aware of the problems. 

Right now I feel an emptiness that fills me in a strange way. I can't help but feel doubtful and worried about my passage in life, but that is my context, it is everything to me. Does this mystery satisfy me...? I guess I'm not too far from the hedonism I repudiate either.",1

A reason for purpose that just exists solely to justify the existence of purpose for that matter.

Maybe there is no purpose to purposes. Purpose just exists.

Since Existentialism in simplicity says ""Existence precedes essence"". Essence would commonly be interpreted as purpose, Yes?

But is there a point in having a purpose or essence aside from trying to avoid nihilism, where there is no meaning in anything and everything is in vain.

Most searches I've done in the internet all just say, we need a purpose to live.

But is there a purpose to that? Or is this questioning of the purposes of purposes a counter-intuitive question that leads to no where.

So any opinions?

We place such immense value on truth and our pursuit of it in the presence of every temptation to lie, whether for our own selfish benefit or for the morale of another.

Our willingness to accept and act out truth is not perfect. All of us have at one time told a lie, at another behaved dishonestly. In ignorance, we act on untruths and half-truths seeded by people who thought they knew more than they did. It is abundantly clear that we cannot be the source of our own correction.

Looking to universally understood objective facts is also in vain, as applying them requires subjective interpretation. If we had the infrastructure and technology to ensure the perfect health of every person on earth, we still wouldn't know to what end we do it. The critical thing that distinguishes a life of authentic purpose from a vacuous spree of hedonistic indulgence is beyond us.

Knowing all this, where are we to look, if not to our own means?

I guess this question doesn't make sense. One could say, of course it would still exist, even if only floating rocks remain (or not even that, just atoms far-far from each other). But is that really existence without any perceiver? 
Maybe after some time a lightning would struck just in the right place and there would be life again. Maybe life emerges from the physical world only and it happens more often than we would think. But still, for at least some time, there is no perceiver, so can we say the world exists for that moment? Can we say the world really exists after every living thing dies?

That’s it.

I meet someone online, a young man who lives thousands of miles away, who lives a life I could only dream of, in a big city with a creative job that pays, meanwhile I’m in this small town seating in front of a computer from 9 to 5, earning the minimum to reach ends meet every month. Over and over again, in a cycle that never ends. I’ve always have had these thoughts, but I always hope they would go away as years started to accumulate behind me, I saw myself as a “rebellious” teenager, always questioning my existence, begging the universe to bring me peace of mind, to make me “normal” like the rest of the people I knew, to take away from me the burden of my own existence. And I have to go even further back, when I was a small child, I was told I was gifted, smart and with a bright future ahead of me, definitely a burden no kid should ever bare, I didn’t wanted to be gifted, I wanted to be happy, I wanted to be ignorant of the things grown ups told me were important. But that burden only got heavier, all my life I’ve been trying to figure out how to get rid of it, fighting and running from it but it always seems to find me, and now with social media, smartphones, and information everywhere I look, it is even harder. There is no escape. I write this hoping to find someone out there that can show me a way out of whatever this is, some people call it a simulation, some other call it capitalism, I don’t know what it is or where does it come from but I didn’t chose it and I don’t want it, and I want to relieve my children from it, and all future generations.

But tbh, taking time out for yourself and simply being good and present for yourself is also highly important and can be understated. Just making your life about which goal you achieve next is actually considered another form of dopamine chasing more centered around the ability to delay gratification - but you’re still chasing a hit.

1691981865.0,Capitalism. Existentialism. SUFFERING.,"
I, like many of you, have been inadvertently placed on this cumrag of a planet to be a clockwork wage slave. The consequence of my existence is just that: to serve as a means of achieving what is not mine. A paycheck, as rewarding as it may seem to some, is not something to be proud of, for any set amount of newly displayed digits that appear on your checking account are to only be allocated for the sake of monetized survival. Humans have essentially monetized everything in existence, including your very own existence. Water, which is found nearly everywhere, still comes at a cost. Air conditioning, which is fundamental to one’s health, comes at a cost. Health itself comes at a cost, and at a big personal expense at that. Sanity comes at a cost. What I find to be incredibly fascinating is that the preponderance of human beings, regardless of menial occupation (however, heedful of pay rate, workload, and status), can and must work five to six days a week to make ends meet, with only a mere day or so off, while of course still failing to make ends meet.

We were not taught money in school because the government does not want us all to be rich. The majority of the work undergone by those who frequent this subreddit seems to be menial jobs; regardless, it is devoid of anything positive, and understandably so. The feelings of helplessness naturally intensify when one goes about working their menial job, and observes their bosses or “leaders” nonchalantly going about their day not suffering one bit; as the subordinates {the menial worker} of the said individual/s in ‘power’ {i.e., bosses}, stress in anguish as they are yelled at or disrespected constantly by customers, guests, and even the said bosses, who trivialize the menial worker's existence so that expectations can be met at the expense of inhumane suffering. Ironically, the menial worker's, or subordinates, financial expectations are almost never met. Conversely, if a menial worker is having a bad day on a Monday, or any day for that matter, how is that said individual supposed to get through the next day, all the way up until maybe that Friday, or even Saturday— in a sane, fair-minded way without the usage of pharmaceuticals, without self-harm, and without resorting to violence? Because conformity is an essential byproduct of monetized survival, wage slaves, such as myself, must suppress our natural human instincts in the face of adversity due to the consequential prospects of employment termination and the elimination of income. In other words, we have been conditioned since grade school to be robotic in nature to serve these purposes, and I have finally opened my eyes.

To my belief, capitalism is chiefly responsible for all of this, to an extent. Although, socialism was created in response to capitalism, I personally believe that even if the economic climates were to have been swapped, humans, especially those in power, would still find ways to manipulate, abuse, and screw over us helpless, brainwashed, conditioned, and frustrated individuals. Conformity, at least in my eyes, is synonymous with tolerance. By collectively conforming to this evil system as a whole, we are therefore tolerating the system as it is. However, the only effective means of action for any of this is through force, which is seen in the eyes of the rich as evil; moral hypocrites. Socioeconomic disparity, as a term, is seen as nonexistent in the eyes of those in power. Furthermore, those in power who express “suffering” do not in fact suffer, regardless of micro-, managers, leaders}, or macro-classifications of power {CEOs}. “Suffering” expressed and “felt” by those in power is subjective; suffering felt by those outside of that spectrum is objective.

What sets belief in God apart from belief in any myth? God, being the eternal First Cause, is the cause of all belief in Him. The likes of leprechauns and fairies are beside the point. One who believes in a myth believes in his belief in it, while one who believes in God believes in the cause of his belief.


# With so Much Evil, How is God Good?

To address the problem of evil, it helps to understand what evil even is. Here are some examples of unambiguous evil:

The serial killer derives pleasure from depriving his victims of life.   
The rapist derives pleasure from violating his victims' bodies.   
The controlling sadist derives pleasure from depriving another of his freedom.

All three of these deprive their victims of the means of purpose. So we may conclude evil is manifest in a will against the purpose of things.
If the purpose of all things was ordained by God, then it's nonsensical to say God is evil, that He wills against His own will. Even in considering the possibility of an ""evil God,"" by what means would we know it to be true, that good and evil are defined (since God is the source of all purpose) by adherence or lack thereof to His will? It is perfectly rational to believe God is invariably good, and all evil seen in Him is the result of error and deception.


# All Hope is in God

You might be tempted to say ""I can live a good life on my own."" If not in God, where do you place your hope? What assurance is there in probability, when every die will roll a 6? If you wish to leave behind a legacy for future generations, what is there to ensure no one destroys it? If you wish to live for the thrill of it, what hope do you have after you're gone?

I have never been religious, despite being raised among mostly fairweather Catholics and an incredibly devout mother-figure. No one could ever explain to me good reasons, in my opinion, why they believed in a Christian God and could never provide satisfactory explanations for the hypocrisy and cruelty their religion seemed to condone. I’ve considered myself agnostic since middle school when I first learned what it meant and have not moved away from the label since. I am most comfortable resting in liminal spaces or ambiguity. I prefer exploring and analyzing the effects a mystery has on those experiencing it more so than trying to solve it. I like open endings and the feeling that I am a small piece in an incomprehensible maze. I understand this isn’t how everyone feels, and that people may feel untethered or anxious in these spaces, so I don’t often challenge people on why they cling to the answers they do for the big questions.

While I am confident I cannot and will not know the mysteries of the universe, if there is one or multiple deities or dimensions, if anything happens after we die, etc. I do feel more connected to some beliefs than others and have a general structure around my own spirituality and theories for what happens that make sense to me, but I have always thought it was incredibly…arrogant, I guess, to hold real conviction toward any of them, especially to the point of promoting my beliefs for others or proselytizing. 

I am interested to hear from others who’ve felt like this, because I realize I don’t meet many. And those who’ve felt like this and then later found a belief system that clicked that they now fully believe in, how’d that happen? What changed? Are you happier or less afraid?

I am also wondering how those who are religious and spend a lot of time theorizing about life and death and the meaning or meaninglessness of it all handle their beliefs. How do you hold faith and confidence that what you believe is going on is actually what is going on? How do you challenge those beliefs, if you do, and why? Are you uncomfortable acknowledging that you can’t possibly know and will never know? How do you process doubt and what makes you reaffirm your beliefs when it creeps in?

Hi! i've made similar posts in some other subreddits trying to get insight, but to put the rest of what i'm about to say into context, I'd like to learn more about philosophy but have no idea what to start with, especially given that it's not known for being an easy subject to read. I am 20 years old and halfway through a chemistry degree, I really like what I do and want to go into clinical research but have never been hugely passionate about one specific career, which makes it kind of tough when thinking about how to figure out what i'll be doing 40 hours a week the rest of my life. I know that part maybe has more to do with the politics of this country, but it's a grim reality right now and that being said I want to do everything I can to make sure I have a genuinely fulfilling job and in turn a happy life. No pressure! So, it's impossible to think about that part of my future without getting all existential. I know very little about philosophy in an academic sense, but have heard a bit about existentialism, specifically Camus, and I guess I agree with what seems to be his take which is that there is no definitive meaning to life (worth mentioning that I am not religious) and one's purpose is to do whatever doesn't make you suicidal. I honestly think this is a good perspective to have; I only have one life and should do everything I want to do and make the most of each day. But I know it's really not that simple, and recently i've had this looming fear of ending up with a job I don't like as much as I thought I would, and regretting that I maybe can't change my situation or go back to school, etc. Basically, I think that getting into philosophy would probably give me some insight but don't know where to start.

1691589754.0,I appreciate this subreddit,"Hey all. I appreciate this sub , you guys have all done some thinking and a lot of you have come to your own conclusions but I appreciate that whether it’s some believing in nothingness or others believing in dualism and the afterlife, it seems to be a lot of respect and debate on the matter. Whereas over in other subs I see a lot of “discussion” become dogpiles of popular opinion and denial.

I have always been materialist, and have always felt there was nothing to anything in the sense that everything was just pure chance. And that definitely also went against my main character syndrome - then I got hit with the existential anxiety randomly and haven’t shaken it yet, so much doom scrolling on death, climate, the war… the usual

Anyway I found comfort in learning of things science actually couldn’t fundamentally understand and then comfort in the NDE sub, but I knew well that Reddit is for people that all think that way so I’m not going to find much differing opinion,  but here I really found a sense of well look these are ALL viable options we just have different reasons to believe each one.

Thank you for that x",1

1691491998.0,Meeting death in my ADHD dreams,"
In my dreams, I met this beast. As dark as the night. Shimmering black eyes. With a dull blood red glow. Black Fur, smooth like silk glistening by the dull glow of what seems to be moonlight emanating from nowhere.
Towering shoulders. Claws dark and sharp as shards of obsidian
His breath, soft and shallow. I can feel his immense power. 

He was just lying there. On the ground.

Anyone who goes through the gates sees him and runs in terror. All I can see in their eyes is fear. Like they are in a trance. You can't speak with those. They hear no words. All they know and feel is fear. Running, falling, defacating themselves, screaming. There is only terror. 

I can feel his power. He could move a mountain with one swoop. So why is he just lying there?

As I looked at him, I was trying to figure out his shape. What does he look like? It's hard to tell. He was lying there with his head on the floor with a hand if you could call it that under his face. This great beast. It's dark. It's hard to make out. 

I can see his eyes. Following those who scream and flee, there is sadness in them. 

I walked towards the gate. He hasn't seen me yet. But I know he knows that I am here. 
I wasn't scared. If he wanted to, I would already be dead.  

As I approached closer, he started to move. I stopped and watched as he turned and lay on his if you could call it a belly. With face looking directly at me slowly as he asked. Do you wish to die? 

I froze. I suddenly felt seen. I was afraid. Like I was on a stage. A thousand eyes on me. I wanted to speak, but a thousand thoughts raised through my mind. 

I wasn't afraid of harm or death. I know I am safe. But I was afraid of something far darker within myself. Something among the lines of,  I was embarrassed. Or not worthy. 

Among the racing thoughts, I mutterd. ""No,"" looking down at the ground. I couldn't look directly at him. I felt overwhelmed. But I never felt that my life was in any danger. 

""Then why are you here?"" he asked. 
A thousand thoughts went through my head again. I wanted to say that he looked lonely and could use some company as I felt a connection towards him. Like I see a part of myself within him.  But I couldn't say that. It would be too indulgent of me to compare myself as similar in mindset with this great beast or assume that he has similar needs like me, a nobody human. 
Maybe I should ask him what he thinks, why I am here for? But who am I to ask him such a question? 
Maybe I was just curious. 
Or I was mistaken and foolish.
Among all those thousands of thoughts, I felt it was taking too long to come up with the right words. And I mutterd ""I don't know,""  still looking down. 

Then, he was silent, still looking at me. I can see his reflections on the smooth stones on the floor. 

He tilted his face forward and pushed up a little with his arms. 

Somehow, I knew what he wanted me to do. As it was a request, more towards a command with threat implied by possibility. But one that I would follow regardless out of shear respect. (It's a hard to explain feeling.)

I looked up at him as respectfully as I could. 

For what it felt like an eternity, we just looked at each other. 

 Ten thousand words not said out loud. We had a conversation that goes far beyond words or dimensions that you hold close, within a blank stare for a moment. 

What an honour that was. 
What an experience. 
It's far beyond words. 

Just then, I had a deep understanding of him.
I knew who he was. Where I was. And I knew he knew of me. He knows what I am going to do, and I know if he is fine with it or not. 

I walked in through the gates. As he lay back down slowly turning towards those who run away in terror,
I walked next to him next to this giant face between his arm/paw/claw. Then, I realised that the smallest of his teeth was twise as tall as me. suddenly coming to grasp of how truly massive he actually was. As I lay my back on him, I looked up at his face just in case he was fine with it. 
As I sat, I felt his warmth. I felt safe. Fear was no more. 

He said, ""I have only met a few like you since the beginning of time. ""

I felt truly special. All my inhibitions and anxiety suddenly washed away. I was no longer nobody. 

As we sat there looking at those, run away screaming, stumbling defecating themselves. Like looking at animals. Mindless. 

With a slight smile. I knew it's not yet time to leave. I will follow him when it's time. And I know what that means, and that it's close. So I just want to sit enjoy the show a bit longer.",1

When I was in school, I thought the feeling would disappear when I went to University/College, but it feels like the opposite has happened. I don't really have any ambitions or goals that I want to pursue career wise so Im studying a course I don't have any interest in because it was the best choice based on my school results. Whenever I talk to my friends and hear about how much they love the courses they're studying I am always filled with jealousy that i don't have something that I am that passionate about.

It feels like the world just moves right past me sometimes, like im just a spectator in my own life. I have absolutely zero idea about where I would ideally want to be in the future because I honestly dont even see myself at 30. I find myself just zoning out wondering what the point of all of this even is sometimes, what am I doing with my life.

I know things can change, that I won't feel like this forever but I am so sick of feeling empty in my own body. What am I supposed to do? ",1

1691281992.0,"Stop Thinking About Reality, Stop Thinking About Meaning, Because There Isn't Any","I went down a road, a road that led no where. It had no meaning, no reason, and no answers. But I wasted my time on this road, saw many things, told myself many lies. This road all started with the question; Why am I here? 


This led to me questioning reality, questioning what existence was and my importance in it. I found no answers in the end of it, no matter how much I searched I simply found none. There were times when I thought I was going somewhere, thought I found it out, but in the end they were all just guesses and answers I gave myself. 



Why search for the answers to our existence? Why does it matter so much to you? What are you running from that made you go down this path? Is it the lust for knowledge, the lust for meaning and purpose? I went down this road and found absolutely nothing, because this road never ends. You can go crazy on this road, become delusional and believe in things that simply are not true. 



People say we are in a dream, or a simulation. People believe that this reality isn't real. Let me tell you something though, you are real. You are alive, you breathe, and you think. If you spend so much time in your head, then you will begin to believe that your head is all that exist. You will begin to see reality as false because your mind is false, your mind is the illusion. 



Your thoughts mean nothing, they mean even less then you do, and that's something. You can create whatever you wanted in your mind, but that doesn't mean that it is real. You can dream of a house, but that house simply does not exist. Now, let's say instead of thinking of the house, you went out into the woods. You chopped some trees down, gathered materials, and built your house. Now that house exist, because you took action. 



That house now exist because you took action to build it yourself. You put in the work, and now you can live in the house you imagined in your head. You can't stop the ocean with words or thought, the ocean will always produce waves and continue to move. 



You won't ever know what happens after death, no one ever will. Only the dead know, and you have to accept the fact that nothing very well could happen after death. You will live on only in memories, but even those dissappear. Your body will become soil, and with your death will produce new life on mother earth. You won't feel, and you won't know what happens, because there is nothing to know. 



All we can do is guess what happens. Anyone that says they know what happens isn't knowing, it's belief. The universe is beautiful, and we are apart of it. We don't understand it, because there simply is no understanding it. What we can understand is this though, we will die at one point in our lives. We don't know when or how, but we eventually will. 


Let me ask you something, if you took away all of your beliefs, what would you be? If you found out that everything you thought you knew about spirituality or religion was fake, what would you do? Who would you be? And how would you live? If we somehow found out that we do just cease to exist after death, how would you live? 



We may not matter, but let's pretend that we matter. Let's pretend we are important, and let's pretend we mean something. You matter to yourself and those around you, to your friends, your family, your loved ones. Isn't that enough? Isn't it enough that you are alive? That you are breathing? 



Your mind is the illusion, and it can trick and deceive you. Not can, it will many times. Think of your mind like the devil, the greatest deceiver of them all. There have been many people who tried finding the answers before you, and they searched way longer and harder then you have, yet they never found anything, so what makes you think that you will be any different? People much wiser then you, smarter then you, and people who have experienced much more then you, yet you think you will be the one to solve everything?



There is no solving everything, because there is nothing to solve. We exist, isn't that enough? Stop worrying about existence and the lust for knowledge, and start living. Knowledge is an endless road that leads to no where, knowledge is gained by living. It is gained by time, by experience. Seek wisdom, not knowledge. 



What if there is no God? No heaven or hell? No life after death? What if there is no salvation, what if this is it? How would you live? Why do you focus on what comes after, but not what comes now?",1

1691283284.0,How are people so sure that death is the absolute end?,"With everything going on in the world and new discoveries with physics and quantum mechanics I am just not so sure death is the absolute end or even if life is what we think it to be. There are so many things that we as humans cannot understand/comprehend but yet we try to sound so sure of ourselves.

The government confirmed aliens. This dude got on live TV and said these beings are able to come from different dimensions using QM. We don’t even understand consciousness or where it is in the brain. We don’t fully understand quantum mechanics even if we think we do. I am agnostic so no I don’t think that there is “heaven” and “hell” but there are just so many things that we do not have the ability to grasp. Maybe I just want to feel hopeful about death since I lost my dad last year. So many people have had near death experiences and sure, it may have just been the DMT overload in their brains but being able to describe what was going on around them during that time is insane to me. I think we try to sound so sure out of fear due to the fact that there is so much we don’t know. I am not saying there is something after death but I’m for sure not going to completely dismiss it because I realize there is so much we cannot understand right now! And maybe we never will. There may be nothing but I think there is more to it than we could ever realize. 

I don’t want to sound like a quack or one of those spiritual woo woo people but damn. We haven’t even fully explored the ocean or our universe. There are still some problems with physics that need to be ironed out and that we have no answers for. For fuck sake, we don’t even understand gravity.",1

1691213995.0,Short Story - The Last Thought," Great read.  Enjoy. 

Everything must end eventually, even consciousness. A short story by Grant Bartley.
The last man sits in the tower of the last house, in the middle of the last oasis, and weeps, for he knows that he is dying. Between the waterfalls of his tears he’s recording his last thoughts. Shaking his forefinger at the machine floating in front of him, he says, “I remember when they used to say, at some time in the future the human race will no longer be even a memory. There will be a moment when the human race, and its entire history, will be thought of for the last time.” He looks around him at his study of ancient and eclectic books and paraphernalia, and dry dust in occasional rays of hard sunlight, and mutters, “This is that time.” ……",1

I’ve never been able get my brain to grasp the concept of my own death, and the time leading up to it…

Until now, having turned 30. Suddenly ageing and death has become so real, and it’s raw, man. I think of the things I want to happen, and the things that didn’t, all of the things that went wrong and the things that could go wrong in the future. All of this rumination just gets worse because I currently have no job.

Is it common for people when they leave their twenties and turn 30 to finally start having the inevitable truth sink in?

1690850657.0,Death anxiety is getting to me,"I'm 27 and over the past 3-4 months, I've developed severe death anxiety. The fragility of life is always on my mind. I see all the ways I could be killed, or severely injured, during the course of my day and how much suffering I could face in the process. Freak accidents. Regular accidents. Fires. Intruders bent on harming me. Mass shootings. Terminal illness.

And though all of these are improbable, my mind will blow them way out of proportion and make me feel like they're credible, if not inevitable, threats that I absolutely need to worry about. Surviving into old age and eventually dying of natural causes around the life expectancy feels like the most improbable outcome for me.

And these thoughts will actually affect me. I'll feel intense anxiety that makes me dizzy and unable to think straight. I'm often unable to focus on work or enjoy my hobbies or socialize because I'm too distracted by the possibility of death around the corner, and worrying about what steps I need to take to defend myself and the people around me. It's like I fundamentally don't feel safe anymore. It happens everywhere. Home, out and about, my girlfriend's place, my parents' place, on vacation. Alone, surrounded by people. There is no setting where I'm not affected.

On occasion I'm fine and barely think about any of this at all. I'll scoff at the idea of what I just wrote above. I don't know what helps, if anything; it's just random. But other times the anxiety is so strong that I can't fall asleep because every unexplained sound gets my mind racing.

Because I'm afraid of being seen as either crazy or a gigantic wuss, or passing these intrusive thoughts along to someone else, I haven't told anyone except my therapist. But I'm not finding her to be helpful on this issue so far. She'll listen, understand what I mean, and reaffirm what I already know (my fears are highly unlikely), but it's not mitigating the visceral feeling.

I'm just sick of feeling like this. Nothing even changed to suddenly flip my thinking this way. The only explanation I have is that I was becoming truly happy for the first time ever this year, and maybe I was afraid of that being taken away prematurely.",1

 What is your life?

A human is born on this planet

The world gives them an identity

The world gives them a name

The world says this is right

The world says this is wrong

The world says you must do this

You MUST do that

You MUST accomplish

You MUST not fail

Look at all the cars I own

A beautiful house

A caring family

A disciplined child

A bountiful future

A retirement plan

Stocks to invest

A movie to watch

A show to binge

You receive praise from your friends

Parents telling others how good you are

A job well done by the boss

A caring husband or wife

To be better than someone

To be told you are ahead in life

To be praised by others

To show others you are different

You are successful

You are…

All these means to solidify yourself

What is the self?

Who are you?

What is the I?

You are doing so much work for the continuity of the self

But what is this self that you have spent your entire life cultivating?

Does it exist?

Does it not exist?

Are you just thought?

Are you just an idea?

Are you just the accumulation of knowledge?

Are you just memories fed to you by the world?

What exactly are you?",1

it makes me RAGE. it makes my blood boil - the fact that i even EXIST and have to go through life and the happy bits and the lows of it when i didn’t even fucking ask to be here in the first place and that none of us have any idea why we are here. 

i’m literally one of billions of insignificant organisms hurtling through space on a ROCK in a random solar system that is so small that our brains can’t even comprehend it because it means absolutely NOTHING and the best part is we don’t even know why.  

the happy points of our futile lives don’t even nearly compensate for its lack of meaning - what i’m trying to say is that life is so filled with sadness and suffering and since there is no meaning to life (as i believe) WHY DO I NEED TO EXIST?? i get that some points of life are happy - falling in love, doing what makes u happy etc etc but WHY? the downsides make it not worth it. 

life has no meaning, so u should seek to do what makes you happy in your temporary blip of consciousness in the universe, but why do we have to exist at all. i hate that the minuscule amount of space i take up in the universe causes me to feel things, to be self-aware. i don’t want to feel anything, i’d rather just not exist.

it makes me RAGE. it makes my blood boil - the fact that i even EXIST and have to go through life and the happy bits and the lows of it when i didn’t even fucking ask to be here in the first place and that none of us have any idea why we are here. 

i’m literally one of billions of insignificant organisms hurtling through space on a ROCK in a random solar system that is so small that our brains can’t even comprehend it because it means absolutely NOTHING and the best part is we don’t even know why.  

the happy points of our futile lives don’t even nearly compensate for its lack of meaning - what i’m trying to say is that life is so filled with sadness and suffering and since there is no meaning to life (as i believe) WHY DO I NEED TO EXIST?? i get that some points of life are happy - falling in love, doing what makes u happy etc etc but WHY? the downsides make it not worth it. 

life has no meaning, so u should seek to do what makes you happy in your temporary blip of consciousness in the universe, but why do we have to exist at all. i hate that the minuscule amount of space i take up in the universe causes me to feel things, to be self-aware. i don’t want to feel anything, i’d rather just not exist.

1700598958.0,There is absolutely NOTHING more disturbing and completely horrifying than consciousness and existence,"Being consciousness is literally **the actual scariest thing that can possibly happen** it is **the scariest fucking thing in all of existence** 

I feel like once one truly realises and feels this, that's when their mind starts falling apart and their life starts getting destroyed, we aren't meant to become aware of this, it's literally damaging to the brain, I can feel my brain decaying more and more each week that passes, each week of this 100% unbearable panic and terror that literally never ends, no reprieve whatsoever...

Developing a phobia of consciousness and existence is probably the absolute WORST phobia you can develop, all the other phobias in existence you can do something about or avoid, fear of spiders? Just avoid areas where they hang out, fear of heights? Just travel by sea and land, fear of death? You can delude yourself that you go somewhere amazing when it happens.

But fear of actual existence and consciousness itself? There's fucking NOTHING that can be done about that AT ALL, see a therapist? They are part of existence, take medication? Those are part of existence too... No distractions work at all because all these distractions are a part of existence and existence IS the problem, existence IS the thing that is terrifying you, nothing in the world can possibly soothe you because everything is a part of existence, there is literally NO WAY to comfort yourself at all.

Every day I feel absolutely rage and hatred towards myself for developing this fear, it's completely taken my life away because now I just lay in bed completely overwhelmed with terror shaking and sweating all day, terrified of my own consciousness that I can't do anything about, I've had to stop everything, my driving lessons, my gym, my once a week coffee mornings, my volunteering, I've stopped everything I could once do because now I just have these horrific panic attacks when I do them, it's so fucking heartbreaking ",1

And though I’ve always felt that it’s important to know that you’ll be gone one day, I’ve felt blocked to feeling those things and thinking those thoughts, even when I’ve conciously focused on trying. I’ve never been able get my brain to grasp the concept of my own death, and the time leading up to it…

Until now, having turned 30. Suddenly ageing and death has become so real, and it’s raw, man. I think of the things I want to happen, and the things that didn’t, all of the things that went wrong and the things that could go wrong in the future. All of this rumination just gets worse because I currently have no job.

Is it common for people when they leave their twenties and turn 30 to finally start having the inevitable truth sink in?

1693669008.0,I turned 30 and more than ever think about how I am going to inevitably die.,"My wife and I started watching Six Feet Under shortly after I turned 30 and now I constantly think about I am going to someday inevitably die. It was something I never thought about at all in my life, even going through periods of severe depression and suicidal ideations years ago before medication as I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Death at that time would’ve been a relief when I was suffering, but it’s opposite now.

The part that I fixate on the most is how fast my life has gone. I am already 30 years old, have been married for a decade, and it hasn’t felt long at all. 30 more years (if I make it), I’ll be 60. How long do I have after that? Who knows. At best, another 20 something years. I think about how fast that’s going to come, too. There’s no way I can fit in everything meaningful I may want to accomplish or experience in that time.

What’s going to happen when I die? Is there an afterlife? Is there nothing? How is it possible to feel nothing and not be conscious, permanently? Nobody knows. 

I can’t believe it. I’m terrified of death and there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it because it’s how life works.",1

So many users on this subreddit experience external crisis, forgetting that the whole porpuse is to make your own meaning.

I like to pair Existentialism with Absurdism, because it's so important for your mental health to have a meaning in life, while also remembering that life is a random experience of moments. 

Imagine walking down the street, just having proposed to your future wife the other day and then a tire of a car comes loose and hits you on your head. It's an extreme example of course, but that's just exactly how life works.

It's absurd, but the purpose needs to be created by you, remembering that everything can still have a meaning in a meaningless world.

So the next time you question your existence, make a tea and listen to the sound of the birds. But if you are not capable of doing so, close your eyes and count to one; that's how infinity feels like.",1

1612533745.0,"Sex is absurd, sexual desire is painfully unavoidable and it can hinder your search for meaning","So this is more of an existential rant than a philosophical contemplation, but we have to start from the individual and his experience to grasp the dilemmas of human existence, *right*?

I think sex is ridiculously absurd most of the times. Outside of a relationship where it can be regarded as a form of bond with another human being in demonstrating affection, intimacy and empathy in the search for each other pleasure, sex is void and unnecessary; still we find ourselves trapped in the constant desire to stick one another genitals in our bodies and exchange bodily fluids while we have a peak of intense please for about 10 seconds and then... then nothing. Back to plain life.

What bothers me the most is that Western civilization is so obsessed about sex and pleasure in general that it leads many people to live an inauthentic life, exchanging an active search for meaning and plenitude for an ephimeral feeling of ectasy, comfort and escape from reality. (Viktor E. Frankl said ""**when a man cannot find meaning, he numbs himself with pleasure**""). So, if you abstain from having sex, you are seen as inferior or defectuous, a loser, and even if you don't give a shit, you encounter sexual stimuli **everywhere.** It's impossible to escape the thought of sex when everyone is saying you should have lots of it and when it is around the corner enticing you even with cereal ads.

I'm not saying that having an active sexual life is going to make you some shallow alienated product of our sexualized society, but Jesus, I have suffered from watching porn for hours and evading my responsabilities, installing dating apps and hooking up relentlessly, looking for potential partners and discarding them just. because. we. don't. get. the. superior. chemical. rush. when. we. are. in. bed. (even if we understand each other and connect in an authentic way; if sex is bad, you are not a partner material. NEXT).

Life can get out of control; life can look miserable and dull and can be consumed by this one ""condition of existence"" that is utterly irrelevant outside the purpose of having children or connecting with a loved one. Sex fetishizes life to its most mundane and stupid elements most of the time and I'm sick of it, sick of still wanting it more and sick of having my will of power and my ability to build meaning shattered by this absurd, constant, never-ending urge.

I look forward to read your opinions on the matter.

But please, someone read this and give me insight. One day, back in 2008 I was born. In an instant, my whole world blossomed like a flower on a stem. Suddenly I was alive, I was here. I was a happy kid, the world was bright and colorful, I knew what death was, but it didn’t concern me one bit. I believed in heaven then, however I was never taught any formal religion. Fast forward to a month ago. I was sitting in my room, studying for a test when suddenly I had an epiphany. I realized each second I was getting closer to death, a realized that my days are numbered (even though the number is a great amount) I realized that death is most likely nothingness for an eternity, like sleeping with no dreams, like what I saw before I was born. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I closed the tab of my studies and started researching what happens after death. I read articles after articles, a mixture of religious and scientific articles. I believed more in the scientific ones, which said that when you die your brain releases this chemical known as DMT for a few minutes which creates vivid dreams (which can feel like hours, despite only being a few minutes) and then after the dreams are over it’s just eternal nothingness. Nonetheless I am terrified. Why do I even live if I just die? Why did I have to be born? My study session ended in tears, and my thoughts have been distressing me since then.

But lately I (22 F) can’t help but get super depressed about the fact that I have to work for the rest of my life, spending 40 hours every single week in the same place doing the same thing. I like what I do and am grateful for that, but that doesn’t mean it is what I would choose to be doing with my time. The idea of slaving away forever just seems so unnatural to me. Idk, maybe I’m talking out my ass, but thinking about this makes me dread everyday life. 

Of course I’m well aware of the importance of work. The world can’t go round without people doing their jobs. But sometimes it just gets to me and I feel like squidward in that one episode where he lives in that perfect neighborhood and wakes up and does the same thing everyday. Even though I don’t necessarily hate my job, waking up and doing the same thing, and then facing the reality that it will always be like this if I want to survive, just doesn’t sit right. I graduating college a year ago and just recently I have started to get very depressed about my job.

1694931733.0,"The older I get, the more I realize that life is not worth living","As I grow older, I increasingly realize that life may not be what we were promised when we were children. It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

&#x200B;

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

&#x200B;

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

&#x200B;

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

&#x200B;

Of course, it's possible to be happy, but it requires finding one's path, having a long-term vision, making efforts, and being lucky. Nevertheless, I still feel deeply unhappy seeing that it is realistically to late for me.

1659576156.0,Jordan Peterson is NOT existentialist.,"So many people wrongly think that Jordan Peterson is an existentialist.

This is an easy mistake to make if you aren’t properly educated in existentialist philosophy, and he does often talk about existentialist philosophers such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, etc. which can give the impression he is an existentialist.

However, existentialists believe at a fundamental level, that existence precedes essence. Basically, they reject the traditional metaphysical worldview called essentialism, which holds that essence precedes existence, and holds that all things have essences which define their identity at a fundamental level.

Applying existence precedes essence to people, we get a worldview that people define their own identities, and don’t have a pre-existent life purpose, and aren’t defined by arbitrary categories like race and gender, which in an existentialist worldview don’t exist metaphysically, (again they reject the idea of essences)

Simone de Beauvoir was also an existentialist philosopher, and she was one of the first people to really articulate the sex/gender distinction. In her philosophy, “one is not born, but becomes a woman”.

Jordan Peterson would call this idea “postmodern neo-Marxist”, and probably doesn’t realise it’s existentialist.

See, in the existentialist worldview, categories like gender aren’t defined by biology, you can’t say a trans woman isn’t a woman because she lacks a uterus, because that would suggest a uterus is an essential property of womanhood. Existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir are postmodernist and social constructionist, something which Jordan Peterson really demonises as radical leftist ideological dogma. He also refuses to use gender pronouns for trans people, as he insists that gender is defined by biological sex (an essential property of gender), and he believes that reality is defined by fundamental categories, like order and chaos, and deeply opposes attempts to deconstruct those categories.

Jordan Peterson also holds some surprisingly deterministic views about human nature, believing social hierarchies to be inevitable because of the way our brains are hardwired due to evolution. He also believes that certain gender differences, such as women’s tendency to select men based on status, and differences in interests over people vs things, are biologically predetermined. Also, the whole concept of human nature is arguably essentialist, as it suggests humans have a fundamental essence.

Existentialism presupposes a radical freedom of the will, and that we aren’t predetermined or destined to live certain kinds of lives, or behave in particular ways. Jordan Peterson claims to believe in free will, objecting to Sam Harris’s determinism, but it’s likely he endorses a compatibilist rather than libertarian view of free will, and secretly agrees with Sam Harris. He compared free will to a chess game, where the rules are predetermined (presumably by human nature and evolution) but we choose what move to make.

This is quite a deterministic analogy, as it presupposes a goal, i.e. checkmate. Again, the whole notion of destiny and fixed life purpose is deeply antithetical to existentialist philosophy.

What do you think? Am I misunderstanding Peterson’s complex philosophy, or do you agree with me that he holds an essentialist worldview? I personally think his views are so far removed from existentialism that I must question whether this is some sort of backlash to existentialist philosophy.",1

We’re born, we get the sudden chance to build a life, build connections and attachments to other people, attachments we don’t want to part from. We form a personality and a body and we even become attached to our own existence and body. We don’t want to leave it. Then literally any moment we’re robbed of ALL of it.

However there’s no point and no explanation to life or existence or humans. But existence exists, and thus humans do too. And reality as we know it are our unique perceptions of reality. The only reason we can perceive anything including our own existence is chemical reactions and electric brainwaves and even then we don’t even know if what we’re experiencing is real because that’s just how we perceive reality. Reality wouldn’t exist if there was no conscience to perceive it. Similar to if a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?

**NEW-COMER FAQS**

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

1. **What’s the meaning/purpose of life, existence, etc?** | The Existentialist believes that we don’t and can’t know for sure, because we’re not able to access absolute knowledge about the nature of our reality. Instead, the fundamentally subjective nature of the way in which we perceive our world means that meaning is created through the exercise of that subjectivity—in other words, that we create meaning for ourselves through the use of our Agency. Meaning doesn’t exist in the world as an inherent property; instead, it’s created by us as we assign it to things that we believe are meaningful.
2. **What happens after we die?** | The answer here is, again, that we can’t know because we’re not able to access absolute knowledge about the nature of our reality. We have no reason to trust that anyone can know for sure—therefore, we have no reason to trust anyone who tries to tell us that they do. Instead of living as a slave to what *might* come after we die, the Existentialist believes that we can only live according to what we believe that we *can* experience in the now—in other words, in the world which we inhabit while we are alive.
3. **What’s the difference between Nihilism, Absurdism, and Existentialism?** | [Popular consensus](https://www.google.com/search?q=nihilism&oq=nihilism&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61l2j69i60.2087j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) dictates that Nihilism is: *the rejection of all religious and moral principles, and the belief that life is \[inherently\] meaningless.* Absurdism can be defined as the embracing of this principle of inherent meaninglessness, and thereafter the act of striving to live one’s life to its fullest potential in spite of it. Existentialism, meanwhile, is neither the rejection of meaning, nor the embracing of an *inherently* meaningless existence—instead, it’s the rejection of this idea of *inherence* itself. The Existentialist does not believe that existence is *inherently* meaningless; instead, he believes that meaning (and therefore also *meaninglessness* itself) is not and cannot be *inherent* to existence… **because meaning is something that we create.**
4. **Do we have Free Will, or do we live in a Deterministic universe?** | The Existentialist believes that we don’t and can’t know, again because we’re not able to access absolute knowledge about the nature of our reality. Instead, regardless of the true metaphysical nature of our existence—regardless of whether or not we actually really do have Free Will—we live in a world in which it *appears* obvious to us that we have Agency; that we have the ability to act upon and change the state of our reality. The world which we inhabit *appears* real to us—and, until there comes a time when we might discover that it’s not, there isn’t really any good reason for us to treat it as though it’s not.
5. **What should we do with our Agency?** | The Existentialist believes that this is up to *you*—to each individual person—to decide. Your choices are yours, and yours alone, and nobody else can really answer this question for you. There is no *should* for you to address with your Agency—only what you *decide* to do with it.
6. **My life sucks. What do I do?** | Exercise your Agency. Try to figure out how to change your circumstances and situation. *“We are abandoned upon the earth”*, and you have no reason to believe that anybody’s going to come and save you. Therefore, if you want something to change, then *you’re* going to have to be the one who goes out and makes it happen. And if it hasn’t worked, didn’t work, or is still just not working? Go ahead and lie down and give up… or try again, and try harder. Really—you can do what you want. That’s up to you to decide.

Think about it, people confide in a higher power that supposedly made them and everything around them, and also at the same time says they are the most important beings in the universe, and if they join his particular religion over 900000000000 other sects and religions, they’ll go to heaven. but he gets pissed off at women not being “modest” and at gay people which will to to hell. Sounds man made, doesn’t it? Sounds like it was made by horny, egotistical men who believe they’re right and get an ego boost when they feel important. But secretly they are empty inside and are too scared and unsure to face their fears. Because why would the creator of the entire universe care if Johnny kissed Tim or if Ava and Nancy got married.

1633810697.0,Nobody really cares about you especially once you grow up.,"I don't like thinking the world is totally cold but it's certainly not as friendly once you're an adult . I think it really hit me after I grew up. When you were young your parents, teachers, and friends all cared about you. Not that you need them anymore but that reassurance of somebody had your back gave you a sense of security. They asked if you were ok and were there for you when you needed it. Now it's like too bad tough it out, we're all suffering alone, get with the program. 

You deal with this enough times and  it doesn't surprise me that people feel lonely.  I feel there are so many ways people cope with this. Not that I know specifically but I know  there are people out there who feel like nothing and do everything they can to.  I guess social media is the main example. I'm glad I don't take it that far but I get why it happens. People don't get the love like they used to.",1

Like it doesn’t happen when I wake up in the middle of the night.

Sometimes it is unfathomable to me that I am existing with this technology and so many changes and big events in my life. I mean not to sound ridiculous, but experiencing tech and the internet almost as a whole with society as one as well as social media boggles my mind! It’s not like right now where a new app comes out or VR headset, the experience of the internet changing our world forever and the fastness of communication and news as a result is crazy! 


But on a deeper level it brings me to tears when I think that I was born in this day and age, able to write this post, without worry of being attacked by another human or animal. I need not worry about the food resources I have as I have several grocery stores in the area, even other people that will make hot and ready food for you! Life is so good and stable that we have the luxury of resting on dry cleaning comfy furniture, to rest without needing to sleep is bliss. 


And finally my main feeling, I can’t believe I exist with my husband baby dog and cat together at the same time. I am overwhelmed with love and devotion towards them. It makes me scared sometimes to think I am active and conscious with these thoughts and then one day I may never think another thought again or exist in any sense.

They literally have a rulebook for life. They can go their whole lives believing in a God and an afterlife and be completely content with dying, thinking that they're passing into the eternal next life. 
The void and lack of meaning of life doesn't bother them because they believe differently and I mean power to them I wish I could believe like that again so I could just be content with existing and never have to worry about the cessation of my consciousness whilst I'm still conscious because in my brain I'd think I have all the time in the world.

Let’s say religious people are right. There’s a God, and he created the world as we know it. Makes more sense, right? But who created God? Another God? And if it was another God, then who created that God? It’s this endless loop of counter arguments. And to be honest, i don’t see how an all powerful being like God can also just “come from nothing”, and people say “he never had a start he just always existed”, yeah that’s bullshit 

Now final argument, what if life is a simulation and we’re being controlled by some cool team in another reality? But who created that other reality? How did the real reality come to be to create OUR reality?

1598519029.0,Having an existentialist mindset in this Plutocractic capitalist reality is torture.,"Idk if I'm existentialist, but I ID with some tenets of the philosophy. Capitalism is kind of like a stand in for the idea of ""God"" for me. For all intents and purposes, it's the gospel of this world, it forces you to conform, it determines a path of ""be born, get indoctrinated, get higher levels of indoctrination, work for 50 years and die"" for the vast majority of the species. I could be wrong but I feel a strong parallel between that and my inclinations of existentialism. I reject all that shit on paper and am doing my best to form my own life and reject that ""god"" but it's so entrenched in every avenue of our lives that it almost feels impossible to not conform. If this is all rambly and stream of consciousness bullshit, I apologize. Ofc I don't believe in anything being preordained, but whatever put me here, whatever reason I exist, it's for the express purpose of trying to poke some holes in this Culturally Hegemonic existence and I realize that because that's all I think about, I can always find a thread or way leading back to the capitalist status quo.

1638399948.0,Watching someone die makes really makes you wonder about how it will feel when you finally die.,"One of my grandmothers has Alzheimer's disease. The other one died from Alzheimer's. I find it a horrible disease. The sufferer slowly loses touch with their reality. The loss of sentience creeps in such a gradual way that the individual is hardly ever aware of the degradation and by the time it becomes noticeable the individual's mind has degraded beyond the potential to even recognize the degradation. I always said that if I were to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's I would go out into the forest and fistfight a bear. Recently I've been pondering the fact that dementia might be a preferable alternative to dying lucid. 

When you're lucid, you have the inescapable recognition that the yawning and abyssal chasm of what Heidegger calls 'The Nothing' looms before you. It is a dizzying and quite literally existential feeling knowing that each thought at that point may potentially be your last before you're swallowed by eternal umbra. I spent a combat deployment in Afghanistan. Quite frankly, I'm not terribly happy with my role as colonizer in a war that quite clearly fought for corporate interests. Especially as a man whose people had suffered from horrific colonization. The cognitive dissonance still fucks me up. Our first KIA in Afghanistan was a pretty vicious one. V.B. got hit by a directional IED. The Taliban had packed a giant circular tube with motorcycle parts and about 40 lbs. of explosives underneath it. They effectively constructed a giant shotgun. When said IED ignited, it blew off both of his legs and mangled one arm which might as well been amputated considering it was only held on by a thin piece of meat. I actually watched as his leg do cartwheels in the air above the explosion before falling back down into the crowd to end up Satan knows where. 

He had a brief moment of lucidity before he lost consciousness. His last words were 'goddammit.' Simple, poignant, yet powerful words. Goddammit. The stark and sudden realization that it's always the one mistake. A brief moment of inattentiveness and suddenly, poof. The existential recognition that this is how you die.

1635859576.0,Why does love feel infinite?,"One of my favorite quotes from Ernest Becker says that if God existed, his greatest curse for Man would be to make him a finite animal with infinite horizons.

The quote refers to the fear of mortality, but I believe it also applies to love.

When I was 18, I worked with a 24 year old woman in a non-profit. We both had the same “rank”, but she was more mature, and she befriended me and took the time to make sure I understood what every situation meant and how I should react to certain tough spots and challenges. I didn’t fall in love with her in a romantic sense, but I loved her like I would love an older sister if I had one.

She moved to France, it’s been about three years and that relationship is long overdue, but I still wish I had the time to pay her back for how much she helped me gain maturity and make my way into adulthood.

The thing that existentially baffles me is that this feeling (which I consider to be love) feels infinite.

If you ask me how much I’d give for her to be happy, my spontaneous answer would still be “whatever it takes”;

If you ask me for how long I’d do that, my spontaneous answer would still be “always”.

And it hurts that I won’t be able to always be faithful to that “infinity”, just like in the existential despair Becker described - because I’m a small, finite animal, with my own share of communication issues and limitations.

Isn’t it weird that we can conceive our love to be as intense and momentous as we’d like, even though we are finite and limited?

And isn’t it amazing that even though we are mortal, and capable of simply forgetting things, we can still love people years after a relationship is over, or even when we don’t want to be around them at all?

I haven’t met my ex in years, and even though I don’t want to be around her and know that we were just kids when we fell in love, there will always be a part of me that will answer yes to both questions above. I want her to be happy, and that feeling will never leave. 

Isn’t that amazing? I don’t believe in god, but I believe those feelings are as close to an infinite entity as we can ever get.

We are finite, tiny mortals, but the mere fact that we can imagine and feel infinity is really cool",1

That's my most likely theory, if we are not to presume most people don't just lack the intellectual processing power for such abstract thoughts. 

Or are most philosophers just predisposed to dark, depressing thoughts, which take up most philosophical schools of thought? I.e. Always thinking about the lack of meaning/purpose, suffering, etc. Could it be a neuro-chemical issue? Though I think for many it could be a egg-before-the-hen scenario.

1603842610.0,Started reading “Sapiens” by Yuval Noah Harari. Left me feeling ignorant and amazed.,"I’ve always known I’m just a very intelligent animal. 

Humanity as a whole is that. Not a divine entity, nor the epitome of creation, just very smart creatures.

But I never really thought about it. I didn’t get myself to investigate the roots of humanity, it didn’t even cross my mind.

Yesterday, I started reading “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” and I’m amazed.

I didn’t put thought to the fact that our species, Homo Sapiens is just, well, that:

 A species of a bigger family, the Great Apes.

At one moment in history, they where 6 different human species living at the same time on Earth. 

These included the Homo Erectus and Homo Neanderthals, among others.

The fact that in the present, only our species (Homo Sapiens) is alive, makes it very difficult to put in perspective just how “animals” we are. 

It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we are unique and special just for the fact that we run the world and we have no competition. 

But that’s just recent history. A millennia ago, we weren’t more important than lions or gorillas.

A recommended reading for sure. Really puts our place in reality into perspective.",1
1698526393.0,"If you are afraid of death, understand that 5 year old you is already dead","If you are afraid of death read this.  A common response to all the posts here about fearing death is ""don't worry about death, it will be like it was before you were born.""  But this doesn't really resonate with a lot of people.  We don't know what that was like and can't really relate.

Perhaps easier to understand is that 5 year old you is already dead.  After all what are we?  If we are our bodies, know that your cells turnover regularly, so the body you have now is 100% different from the one 5 year old you had.  If we are our memories, well, your bank of memories when you were 5 was a whole lot different than they are now.  You remembered lots of things then that you don't now and vice versa. If we are our personalities then I'm sure your personality is extremely different from what it was when you were 5.  For the most part you would react completely differently to the same scenarios now as you would then.

So where is that 5 year old you now?  That particular combination of cells, memories, habits, personality traits, etc?  They are nowhere.  They are gone forever, never to return.  They are dead.  Sure, the current you, who is in almost all respects a completely different person, may have some memories of what 5 year old you did.  But that's not all that different from when you will die, and the people around you will retain memories of your actions for quite some time.

&#x200B;

Are you worried about 5 year old you?  Are they suffering?  Is there a great light of consciousness they had that is now snuffed out?  Are you grieving their untimely demise?

&#x200B;

Not only is 5 year old you dead.  1 year ago you is dead.  1 month ago you is dead.  Yesterday's you is dead.  1 minute ago you is dead.  The you that exists now is about to die.  Never to return.  Death is the most familiar thing in the world.  What death will feel like for you is what tomorrow will feel like for the you that is reading this.

So, context (because this isn't fully due to Covid and lockdown) :  a few days ago, I made the bad bad bad decision to watch a very graphic video I wish I hadn't seen in which a man had his head chopped off by terrorists. (A real video from the early 2000s, and please don't ask me who it was or details, I'm traumatized enough). Obviously, I fell into a rabbit hole about my own mortality, but even past dealing with the trauma of that specific video and the whole business that is terrorism, I descended into a pit of existential questions about life and death as a whole. 

And now I  just get this weird feeling of grandiose, mind blowing absurdity when I think of how insane it is that my conscience is just one in trillions of consciences that have been and will be, and how absurd it is that my conscience isn't something that can hop from one life to another but a mere bunch of atoms that could cease to function at any moment. Does that make sense? I just feel like reincarnation has to exist even if I know it doesn't, because otherwise what the...

Important : it's not so much depressing to me as it is an intrusive thought. The video was depressing but now it's mostly the absurdity of life that is getting to me. I've always thought it to be meaningless but now it *is* starting to drive me a little nuts because I can't focus on anything else.

Personal context : I'm a happy 24 year old woman and I've always had a healthy approach to living and dying, but the lockdown has suddenly dropped it upon me that I am ME, and all the weird, bigger-than-life, incomprehensible stuff that comes with it. I live alone so that obviously doesn't help to chase the weird thoughts. I have friends to talk to but I don't have people over to my place too often so there's a lot of empty space for me to pace in and think.

An Anxious mind.

An anxious mind, it's constantly racing, existential thoughts and silent contemplation.

The more I age, the less I know, we move in linear fashion, what's after that though?

A lot to learn, its time to grow, I want to live for the present, time slipping 'to cracks below.

Constantly thinking, I feel myself sinking,

There's a constant grind, 'cos society's blind.

The systems are wrong, and I don't belong, in this anxious mind.

We come & we go, so much to lose, what do we really set out to prove?

Be wary of the propaganda and the false ideologies it is teaching.

The fake prophets in their flashy towers are constantly preaching.

A society obsessed with vanity, slowly slipping into insanity. Hatred for others and loss of clarity.

The concept of time embedded in our minds.

I don't feel fine.. in this anxious mind.

Let go of the fear of the future that is near.

Our lives are finite, at least this much is clear.

When all's said and done, off we go to a peaceful abyss, you know what they say, that ignorance is bliss.

For when I am gone, I will not know, or perhaps there will be peace.. in a golden afterglow.

I have existential thoughts every day. I was with my brother today, and I looked at his hand. I thought ""he has bigger hands than me"", and then my thoughts spiraled into a momentary existential dread and meaninglessness. It happens all the time.

In general I feel like the part of me that's ""existentially aware"" is way too active for me to feel ""normal"" and happy. I feel like I have to pretend to be invested in a lot every day stuff, because my brain is always like ""I don't even know why I'm here. Am I the only one here who thinks all of this is bizarre? We're all gonna die.""

I've always been like this, and it's definitely
shaping me as a person. Nothing in life seems to be able to distract me from it for any significant amount of time. When reading about existentialism I can relate on a rational level. As in, if someone asked me about the meaning of life I would say that you create you're own meaning. But I don't experience life that way myself. 

For me, the existential thoughts spiral into hopelessness and sadness. I'm not consciously nihilistic, but my emotions often are. I see my parents and my  thought is that I'm watching them die. I look around and I feel hopeless because everything feels meaningless. I think about the future, and I'm sad because everyone I love will die. I think about the past, and I'm sad because I remember what it felt like to be a happy child laughing with his parents, ignorant to what life really is. And now I'm sad because I'm thinking about my parents' perspective. Seeing their happy child grow up to be a perpetually sad and existentially confused person.

1591808281.0,I only exist so that my cells can survive!,"I was reading this book called ""The Biology of Belief"" by Bruce H. Lipton who is a cell biologist. In the first chapter, he talks about how an individual cell of a human being is similar to a human being and it constantly analyzes its environment and acts to ensure that it survives. In explaining multicellular organisms he says that for 2.75 Billion years, the Earth only had unicellular organisms which were conscious and had gotten very smart. Then they got smarter when they started forming small colonies of tens or hundreds of cells, all of which had the same intent of survival. The success of these colonies eventually led to bigger colonies of up to trillions of cells, in the due course of which they had become more organised i.e., they all grouped together with different groups performing specialized functions, functions which only ensured the survival of all the cells belonging to the colony.

All these days I used to think that all the cells which comprise my body are there so that I can exist but reading this completely turned it around for me.

My consciousness is just a sum (or maybe more) of the consciousness of all my cells. I only exist so that all the cells which comprise my body want to survive! I only exist to ensure their survival! Everything that I do from eating to exercising to running in the rat race to sleeping is only to ensure that my cells survive. And when the colony of cells which comprise me can't grow any more, I need to reproduce so that more copies of these cells are created!

This has been driving me crazy all day and has put me into an existential crisis.

1622732875.0,Scared of the nothingness after death,"25m here, and there's nothing more terrifying to me than the idea of nothingness after death. It make existence feel like a cruel joke. To live in a world with so many wonderful things to experience, so much love to feel and so much fun to have, just to one day have you consciousness slip away and never be able to experience these things again. To never be able to give my girlfriend a hug again, to never be able to laugh again, to never be able to listen to my favorite music again, its a possibility that no matter how much a try to rationalize it I can't make myself accepting of.

I've looked into a lot of threads involving people with similar problems and always see the same sort of responses. ""Why worry about something you can't do anything about?"", ""it's no different than the time in your life before you were born"", ""just think of it as a long rest, its no different than when your asleep really."", but I never really find any comfort in it. Knowing I can't do anything about something unpleasant happening doesn't do much to make me feel better about it. I know it's no different than before you were born, but before I was born I didn't know what I was missing. I also find id rather be awake and living life than asleep and not (dont worry I do get proper sleep).

My only real solace is, I'm not entirely convinced that nothingness after death is what happens. My girlfriend got into some occult/spiritual stuff lately and I've been casually learning about it by what she's shown me, and quite honestly I'm not quite sure it's all hogwash. The idea that we're all connected to the universe by some kind of spiritual energy seems very real. After all what is life? What is consciousness? I'm not sure these things are all strictly evolutionary. Could we have some kind of ""life energy"" that something happens to after we die that continues our existence in some way? Sure, I see it as a possibility, but I also see the idea that this universe is just a chaotic mess and we're here by pure, meaningless dumb luck as a possibility, and if im honest, I still see it as a big possibility.

Theres part of me that wishes I could fully commit to a more spiritual mindset, and convince myself that something more after life is more than just a possibility, but honestly I can't lie to myself either. I believe what I believe. 

Another thing I hear quite often is, ""worry about it is just wasting what time we have here on this planet."" I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, but this agreement ALSO seems to do very little to ease my anxiety towards it. It seems that there are heavy ""can't accept what I cant control"" issues here. 

Honestly my life up until now hasn't been the greatest, it's been filled with near daily depression, anxiety, stress and unrealized desire. But despite all of it id rather be alive than not. Id rather stick around and keep experiencing than die and not be able to experience anything, not even our memories of the life we had.",1
1622369901.0,"'An objective meaning of life' is itself a subjective term. Because objectively, there is no such thing as meaningless or meaningful. Things are simply 'there'.","Objectively there would be no such thing as meaning or value or Meaninglessness or invaluable. The whole concept of meaning is subjective. Meaning means assigning value or defining something but how can a subjective being say something has no objective value/definition or something has objective value/definition.

The terms Nothing matters and everything matters are subjective terms. This begs the question if anything a human mind thinks is ever objective, or if is there even anything such as objectivity.Maybe the title is subjective too. 

Humans are in a such a way that they assign meaning and value to things. That can only mean one thing. That only humans assign meaning to everything there is or even nothingness themselves. 

Objectively life is neither meaningless or meaningful and death is neither meaningless or meaningful . Objectively the whole universe is neither meaningless or meaningful. **Objectively the existence of a cosmic entity would also neither be meaningless or meaningful.**

In essence, we can conclude that humans are hardwired to be humans and be subjective. So if humans have the ability to assign meaning or value. Shouldn't they use it to create their own meaning. The only reasonable conclusion from the perspective of life and humanity would be to create their own meaning.

Even if the actions of humanity does not have an impact on a cosmic scale, that does not mean anything would become meaningless or meaningful. If we deem humanity's existence as meaningless by comparing it on a cosmic scale, then we'd be deeming the whole universe meaningless. 

But objectively , the whole universe which also includes humanity and life as it's part is neither meaningless nor meaningful. **Humans are also the universe itself.** Things are simply there. 

Objectively there would not be anything such as absurd or logical too.

So the fundamental principles of the theory of Existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism that life is inherently meaningless are already flawed and skewed. **There is no such thing as 'inherent meaning'.**

That gives us only one solution, i.e, to stop thinking about existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism . We simply don't know a lot of things. And we might never do .

Also, objectively, there would be no such thing as real or illusion. So we simply don't know we are real or an illusion because there might not be a concept of real or an illusion objectively.

Here comes the **opinion part**, which no one has to follow, what we can do is stop caring and let our natural senses take the driver's seat. Let this body live and accept the process of life . Instead of trying to create a meaning, you could see what is actually valuable to your senses, or maybe just create your own meaning if you want. You will have a good experience and a bad experience. In the end the curtains fall, but atleast it was something to distract ourselves.

And one would argue that the previous part is just a long way of saying 'find value in life on your own' and would go on to say this is existentialism , but it's not. This says that fundamentals of Existentialism, Nihilism, Absurdism are itself flawed.",1
1618410659.0,"Why are so many so-called Existentialists here obsessed with telling others how to live?(Existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism are closer-linked than you think.)","What I mean by this is, I've been seeing a trend here of posts complaining: ""This sub is becoming too Nihilistic and Existentialism is not Nihilism!"" What's worse, rather than a discussion on or about, stating differences between the two, the stance here is simply: **stating how one party or the other is ""wrong"" or misinformed and needs correcting.**

I understand that the so-called ""Existential purists"" here are tired of seeing thoughts or ideas that tend to err on the side of Nihilism labelled as ""existential"" and feel the need to correct this. That's all well and good, yet I feel this is also a slippery slope it to outright denying Nihilism, Absurdism or other similar beliefs as a valid viewpoint and attempting to ""bully"" Nihilists or others into a sort of ""existential conversion.

If you see a post here that seems to confuse, or conflate Nihilism for Existentialism, I think it's perfectly reasonable to mention, ""This is not an existential perspective, but rather nihilism."" It's fine to mention that maybe it's not the right school of thought for this sub, but I'm stick of seeing people here claim that what another is thinking or how they are choosing to perceive things is inherently wrong, just because it's a more negative perspective than you may like or makes you comfortable. I've seen here Nihilists labeled as ""sociopaths"", ""ignorant kids"", ""meme lords"" likewise and so on.

Which brings me to my second point:

**SUB-TOPIC: Existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism are closer-linked than you think.**

If people are wondering why there seems to be a trend towards Nihilism on this sub, it's because Existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism as philosophies are all closer-linked than you think. They are all philosophies discussing the same base topic, which is life, existence, and the main difference between the schools of thought come down to perspective of HOW you want to try and interpret and ascribe meaning to life and existence.

**EXISTENTIALISM:** As Jean-Paul Sartre  said, ""Existentialism is a humanism."" It is a more optimistic perspective to the question. ""If life is meaningless, then your lived experience is what gives/creates the meaning."" Think of life in terms of currency: Like the dollar, the euro, the pound, by itself it is simply paper, inherently meaningless, worthless even, but it it people who give it value, ascribe value to it. So, it is perspective which turns something inherently meaningless into the most valuable and coveted thing on the planet.

**Nihilism:** Tends to be a more negative perspective. ""If life is meaningless then there is no point to any of it. Fuck it."" Or rather, more eloquently said, by  Nietzsche, ""The highest values devalue themselves."" But what does that mean? Perhaps a Nihilist might argue that: In a society, the ""values"" we ascribe to, end up causing pain, suffering, destruction. For example: We have police to protect innocent people from criminals and bad guys, and yet the police end up killing innocent people. We have a government to keep things ""fair"" and organized, but that government often works against your best interest, asks much from you in terms of money, taxes, restrictions and doesn't provide an equal output in return. ""The highest values devalue themselves.""

And **ABSURDISM** is a sort of realism. As Camus put it, and I am paraphrasing here: Life is a matter of rolling a rock up a hill, which is destined only to roll down again. But, this work, some may call it meaningful, some may call it meaningless, either way, it gives one purpose.  Actually quoting Camus here: ""The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” If life is meaningless, then it's also absurd, strange, illogical, irrational at times, but that's it, that's life. 

It's all about perspective. If Existentialism is positive, Nihilism is negative, and absurdism is a more neutral stance.

Now, I know that is a gross simplification of the theories. I'm not your Philosophy 101 professor and I'm not getting paid to lecture the deeper and more complex differences, but I'm just trying to simply explain here the answer to the question I keep seeing cropping up:

**The question:** ""Why are there so many Nihilistic posts here in this Existentialist sub?""

**The answer:** Because they are liked in terms of ideology. It is merely the interpretation of the same general question that creates the differences between them.

**If you have time to complain, you have time to explain.** Instead of you just posting another complaint thread about how ""There are too many Nihilists here masquerading as and/or conflating existentialism and nihilism together"", perhaps you could direct them to some resources to better understand the two schools of thought, and make the decision of what they ascribe to for themselves, without being told by others here what they SHOULD be thinking or how they SHOULD be dealing with things.

Instead, I see many others saying ""Oh, here's another misinformed Nihilist, who needs their thoughts corrected."" ""Actually, life isn't bad because there's no inherent meaning and you're WRONG for thinking so."" ""You're being too negative, that's nihilism and that's WRONG."" ""You should be more optimistic!"" ""Chin up lads, it's not all bad.""

**Hearing ""You should be more optimistic"" from a stranger on the internet who has no idea about your current life situation is akin to telling a woman to ""smile"".**

It's outdated, archaic and no one wants to hear it.

I'd also like to remind everyone here to take a minute to take a look at the state of the world around you, currently. **Philosophy is a lens in which we view the world around us.** And that lens is often coloured by current events, the state of the world around us. Existentialism sprang up as a kind of optimism after the bleak state of misery the world was in, in the ensuing aftermath of WWII. It was a way to find meaning and hope again, a spring thaw after coming out of a long winter.

It's now 2021. There is a global pandemic ongoing. In Europe, people have been in varying states of quarantine/lockdown/curfew and have been separated from friends, family for a year plus. As a result, mental health problems, depression, anxiety, is way up. The economic condition is in shambles. The global climate emergency is rapidly escalating, and in the US, an ongoing epidemic of gun violence and police brutality continues to plague the country. People feel frustrated, sad, angry, powerless and all the while an ongoing global pandemic rages with no foreseeable end in sight. If we're talking philosophy as lens you look at life through, it makes sense why, at the moment, people seem to be viewing life more darkly or pessimistically.

In conclusion, I'd like to ask that people here who are doing this to check themselves. It perfectly fine and reasonable for you to ascribe a certain meaning, or lack thereof, to your life, however I find it outrageous that others here are trying to foist their own beliefs onto others or ""correct"" the Nihilistic or otherwise beliefs or perspectives of others. **This is very non-existential.**

 I honestly feel that myself and many others here relate to all three different schools of thought, Existentialism, Nihilism and Absurdism all at varying times and in different ways. **And they are not always mutually exclusive.** Meaning you can be an existential nihilist, or a nihilistic existentialist. You can take a bit of meaning from all three. So, with that being said, if you are an existentialist, then you create your own meaning, for yourself, which doesn't necessarily apply to others. That's the whole point of the philosophy itself. **You don't create other people's meanings or values.**

If others choose to feel miserable because of the current state of the world, their current life situation, or any other reason, **don't preach blind optimism,** instead try and understand where they are coming from. If they post something very negative that smacks of Nihilism, why not compare and contrast the two schools of thought? Open up a discussion. Teach and learn something.

I don't know, I just feel all of us here could try a bit more to make our time remaining on this spinning rock we call ""home"" matter a bit more, by trying to make each interaction with others significant, rather than dismissive.",1

1596594470.0,"Existential crisis triggered by Explosions in Beirut, Lebanon","Hello! As a lot of you may have heard, at about 6 pm GMT Beirut, Lebanon experienced a massive explosion causing fatalities. People are dead, injured or homeless. The explosion was heard and felt throughout the country. 

I am in Lebanon but thankfully me and my family and friends are safe.

Now these explosions have been preceded by months and years of corruption, deterioration of the exchange rate against the dollar, famine, a financial crisis and incompetence of the government.

I needed to rant about these because it is 5 am here in Lebanon and I cannot sleep because I stop thinking about this:

First: what the fuck? I mean, people say they were lucky they survived, but what about the others who died? I feel so guilty I feel like I stole someone's place in existence. 
What is the point of all of this? We have been suffering for years with no hope but to emigrate. But what is the point of existence if it is to be lived in so much pain?

You know, I used to believe that we should create our own meaning in this meaningless world, I really did. Existentialism gave me some kinda hope and sanity in all of this madness.
But right now? I feel helpless. I feel angry. I feel powerless. Our lives can be taken away from us at any time without any explanation. Did these people expect to die like this? For a useless cause? By an explosion caused by the incompetence of its government?

Anyways, I do know this isn't related to existentialism a lot, but I felt the need to share and I always come to this subreddit for help.

I know a lot of you are gonna say to post this on r/existentialismsupport but I don't need support, I just wanted to vent.

Maybe all of this suffering has meaning, maybe all this pain is an illusion.

I'm also gonna be posting some links in the comments where you can donate to Lebanon if you can in these fucked up times.

I can accept that I will die, it’s a natural part of life, of course. I have also heard that the body is literally built to make death comfortable so I know that pain won’t be completely painful. But what I cannot accept is absolute nothingness and reincarnation. 

I love the life I have now, the people I have in it and all of my experiences. I cherish everyone in my life and everything I have gone through. I don’t want to forget all my loved ones and everything I’ve been through. I also do not want to reincarnate because then that would mean I wouldn’t have the memories I have with my sister, my mom, and everyone else I love. 

If Heaven is real, I pray to God that I see my loved ones. If the soul is real, I hope my soul will be with all my loved ones, that I can continue to be with them and they remember. I hope that when this life ends, I do not reincarnate. I am happy with the memories I’ve made and the people I’ve met.

I was nothing, and I will be nothing once I die. Nothingness. It’s just…I can’t stop thinking about how crazy it is. One day, just like the people in old photos, everyone I know will be dead. At the end of the earth, my childhood home, my family, the places that hold such nostalgic memories—they’ll all be destroyed.

I don’t want any of this around me. I don’t want there to be expectations of me because I was born a person. There isn’t really much I want to do in life. But that’s not an attitude that’s allowed for some reason. Human creation, innovation, etc feels pointless. I don’t find anything special or neat about any of it. I don’t think it sounds fun to have a bunch of money, or be famous, or have a hot partner or whatever. Who cares? It just feels like a bunch of weird, made-up, pointless stuff. So if that’s how you see life, what are you supposed to do? I can’t remember a time when it didn’t feel like that. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this.

Edit: feeling the need to add to this post because it seems like I wasn’t clear about what I was trying to say— people are taking this more as “I don’t like society’s expectations of me personally.” That’s not what I was trying to say. Yes, I don’t like societal expectations, but I agree that you can and should ignore them and do what you like! That’s not what I’m talking about though!
I’m talking about humanity’s desire to BE something more than an animal, and then create a lifestyle which we all, to some degree, HAVE to participate in because we were born human.

1700643856.0,I’m ruining my life by contemplating my death.,"I’m 27f, and it has just occurred to me for the first time (about a month ago) that death is real and coming for all of us. It’s ruining my experience as a person.

Not to say that I didn’t know I was going to die before, I did know. I was religious for most of my life, and then fell out of it at around 20 years old (escaped my church and found science and logic). I became an atheist and materialist. But I never truly considered the ramifications of what I believed (or didn’t believe, rather).

It is only with the passing of someone very close to me that I have started to realize that this life that we live in is one giant cosmic horror show. We are imbued with consciousness for whatever reason, and we are seemingly the only beings with the ability to grasp that we are conscious and dying. 

As far as the current scientific literature reaches, dying is like flipping off a light switch. You simply don’t exist anymore. I’ve seen a lot of people say that “you were dead for 17 billion years so it’s not going to bother you after you’re dead” and yes, I realize that. But it certainly is bothering me while I’m alive.

I am a wife and a mother, and I am very happy and content with my life. My life used to be horrible, but I made it into something nice. And now, my ability to enjoy what I have is crushed by the fact that everything I know and love, including my own own consciousness, will someday fade away into the eternal black void of nothing.

I want so badly to believe in some sort of extension of consciousness or soul or whatever, but my logical brain is not allowing me to do so, despite my best wishes. I wish I were not so damned aware.

I was wondering if some of the more spiritual folk, or those of you that believe in some sort of survival of consciousness beyond bodily death, could give me some convincing standpoint on why you believe what you believe?

1620925495.0,The odds of existing,"First there's the whole ""chance of being born"" which hurts to think about.

It seems like complex life is rare in the first place.

I needed the meteor to wipe out the dinosaurs. I needed everything to go absolutely perfectly.

A single generation going the ""right"" way must be on the order of billions of lottery tickets being won simultaneously, if you consider it down to the atomic level. The fact that every single generation had to go the right way *one after the other*... it's genuinely scary.

*And even then* there's things that had to happen in my life to make me the version of me that I am right now, and not some other version of me. Every tiny decision made by everyone around me slightly altered my life to the point where I am right now.

But nothing is forever- the Earth will continue spinning for many, many years after us. Nature, if not the same kind, will regenerate. After the Earth is engulfed by the Sun, other planets, systems, still exist. Although we don’t know, there might be more, more than we could ever imagine hiding in the corners or even far outside of our reach. In the grand scale of things, our world is pretty small. This doesn’t mean you should let loose and ruin the short time you have here, but try and live as fully as you can. But there’s no need to worry- we are smaller than we think. All our society’s turmoil, happiness, triumphs, and history will eventually fade. It will not be sad, because we will be gone, and no one will be there to feel it. Our society is merely a tiny web in a corner of creation, and even the worst we can do will crumble away. So whatever happens, it will be ok.

Edit: Some people are mentioning how this says that we don’t matter, but that’s not true. There are things both smaller and larger than us, but we are here. We matter, to someone or something. Our world would be impacted if we all just disappeared. The society we have created and everything we know has hidden wonders and gifts, that we don’t know for sure are anywhere else. What we build will disappear someday, but for now it is all we know.",1

You know that you are going to stop existing some point in the future if you like it or not, so what's the point of living? You aren't here forever and any chance of your consciousness surviving is erased once the universe dies. Sure you might say that you ""left your mark"" on society, but the universe is going to end and all the efforts of humanity goes to waste.

Everything is made of atoms. Atoms don't have ""wants"" and ""needs."" All the emotions you feel are just chemical reactions that occur. If everything is made of atoms then what separates me from a table? How do atoms make living things? What were they doing before cells and things that could think, reproduce, or anything?

Why does anything (for example the universe) exist? Why and how was it created? How do you get something out of nothing?

Humanity is selfish. You have to suffer through the stress of school the first 20 years and then go to college, graduate school, which costs a lot of money. Then you have to do a 9-5 hour job until your old and go into retirement. The reward at the end? Death. Unless your Einstein or someone really smart, you won't be remembered.

This is one of Soren Kierkegaard’s most famous quotes. I am personally new to studying his work and philosophy. I was wondering though what is the exact philosophical meaning behind this quote and how does it relate to existentialism (considering how he is seen as one of the founding fathers of this form of philosophical inquiry)? Is it saying we shouldn’t bother to use mathematics/logic/science to solve the secrets of life? What is the meaning of life according to this quote? I was also wondering whether this quote is related to another famous quote of his when he said “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” Thanks.

FUN FACT: When doing some research on this I discovered that the popular sci-fi series ‘Dune’ by Frank Herbert had a similar quote in it: “She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: ‘A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.’”",1

1603634292.0,Right or Wrong is not an absolute even though we (humans) constructed it.,"I see a lot of people claiming that because we’ve evolved to have set morals, and know what’s best for humanity as a whole to progress forward, that bounds us to the morality of right or wrong despite them not being absolutes.

This simply is not true.  Just as the universe is indifferent, and nature has no inherent morality, we as products of nature do not as well.  

The argument that we’ve evolved to have such a morality is a fallacy.  It’s arrogant of us in the western world to believe this when many of our own “morals” can be considered backwards, and many of the morals of other countries (such as anti LGBT+ laws) can be considered moral to those societies but immoral to us.  

Existentialism is not religion without god.  We do not have a moral code inherent in each of us.  Why people are afraid of this rabbit hole is obvious, the deep dive into moral ambiguity and eventually Nihilism may be inevitable for some, and the reasoning that “I am creating my meaning through the suffering of others” is a dark one for many, but nonetheless it is inconsistent to suggest that we are bound to any morals inherent to us.

I have my personal morals, lines I won’t cross, but I even acknowledge the inherent bankruptcy of them, meaning, they are mine and mine alone, no force outside of myself or human kind created them.

My simple summary is: Existentialism is not religion without god, so don’t try to make it that.",1

1613290257.0,Plato’s Allegory of the Cave fails to mention that enlightenment comes with a price,"When I achieved what I finally consider “consciousness” or what most people call being mindful, I realized that ignorance truly is bliss.

As some of you can relate, that phrase took on a whole new meaning once I reached a philosophical mindset. As my interest in social, political, and moral philosophy increased, so did my understanding of existentialism. As I sit here, enjoying my wandering thoughts at 2:20am, my brain reminds me that I have no idea of my own conception beyond a human understanding of birth.

Now, don’t get me wrong. I love to have the mental capability to ponder about the universe around me. I love to be able to question, to critique, and to reflect. I am a purveyor of all things knowledge and would gladly spend my time seeking the many truths of this world. But that raises the question: Would those who aren’t existentialist thinkers/philosophers want to have a mindset such as mine? Does not knowing frustrate some more than others? Can a lack of control or otherwise understanding of life itself push someone to nihilism, or even worse, depression? I sometimes find myself feeling this way.

This in turn made me think of [Plato’s Allegory of the Cave](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1RWOpQXTltA), and exactly what reality is. Who’s to say that the world the ignorant reside within isn’t reality? The sunlight burns for a reason, where is the inherent “bad” that those who lead the prisoners out of the cave of ignorance face? Who’s to say that the “Enlightened” aren’t miserable themselves? Exiting the cave is not the end of the journey, it is but a gate into a vast, endless corridor. Human perception is limited, as is the perception(s) of all living creatures. No one thing has all the pieces to the puzzle. On a literal birthing, religious, and scientific level, we are not our own creators. This means that we are subject to the will of an entity we cannot fathom.

In addition to the argument that ignorance is bliss, we must consider that we are all living in each other’s realities simultaneously in this organic life we call consciousness. My beliefs, my actions, me ethics, those are the truth I consciously or unconsciously choose. So then, even I with a more philosophical perspective on life, can still be in the wrong for trying to influence such a livelihood on one of my peers. Who are we as a thinking community to say that thinking is inherently better for lifestyle choices? This may sound silly, but it is in a way an exasperation of power in of itself. Is free thought truly freeing?

When you really sit down with the numbing truth that even if you knew all of the knowledge there were to know, the fact that it is only from a human perspective makes it very limited and incomplete. Our understandings of science, physics, mathematics, it’s all just multiple series of tests and theories. Trial and error. We aren’t born with any innate knowledge beyond common animal instinct. We don’t truly understand the vacuum of space, black holes, what dark matter is or where it is, anything.

What’s most frightening about human knowledge is that we can only understand what we can observe. And even still, we do not concretely understand everything we CAN observe. There are colors, sounds, feelings, etc. that we as humans cannot comprehend physically. How would then, ever have knowledge of them?


TL:DR
Essentially, what I’m saying is, the quest for ultimate truth and understanding is a futile one from the human perspective. Has anyone else come to this conclusion as well?

Would you go back to your past self who was fairly ignorant of reality and how it operates? Have you weighed the pros and cons?

1698113748.0,I personally don’t think you’re able to unexist.,"Personally, knowing Einstein said energy can neither be created or destroyed only transformed, that alone leads me to believe that we go on in some form. Just not the current form. Since energy cannot cease to exist neither can you or me but we will however change form. Energy can never just zap out of existence the way atheists claim. It’s literally impossible for you to not exist after existing. Knowing that Einstein was right, knowing that we’re atoms essentially at our core (which is still energy) the question isn’t whether we go on or not, but what do we go into becoming? Just an idea to play around with. I do not speak in absolute on subjects no human being can give a confident answer to. You can confidently believe whatever you want . Whether there is an afterlife or not the living will never know, but we will all die, and when do we ALL will find out whether what we believed on earth was true or not. The unfortunate part is we have to die in order to find out.


Edit: I think laws of physics have been proven by those UAP’s to have laws we have yet to discover. A species that can’t figure out how objects can travel from 80,000 FT to sea-level in less than 5 seconds has no business confidently telling anyone anything about laws or life after death. We don’t know shit, we just like to think we do. There are obviously methods of propulsion that go beyond our understanding. Humans need to work on humility, instead of us acting like we have everything figured out. We can’t even travel the universe comfortably for fucks sake.

1588604405.0,I can't handle the pressure of giving my life meaning.,"If life is meaningless (it is), then it's my responsibility to give it meaning if I want my time alive to mean anything. However, I am not mentally equipped to create the meaning for my life. It's just too much pressure. If I don't have a substantial enough impact on the future, then wtf was the point of me living at all. (For example) my brother died when he had just turned 13 from cancer, before he got to do anything really. So was the extent of his meaning just to be a part of my backstory? Or possibly my other brothers backstory, and I could just be part of his backstory, and that could be the extent of my meaning. I know that a person's impact on the future is literally a function of fluid dynamics and our little pea brains could never fully comprehend the butterfly effects they cause, but don't you have to be able to see the effect you have on the world for it to qualify as meaning or purpose. Because the meaning is created in your head, and you can't enjoy the fruits of your labor if you're already dead. Like, was Van Gogh's life meaningless? Nobody gave a fuck about his art while he was alive, so he never knew the impact it was going to have on all the future artists who came after him. So was his life meaningless to him? (Which is all that really matters anyway) 

What I'm trying to get at though is, how can I be responsible for my own meaning, for my own purpose, for my own happiness? I'm not even responsible enough to do chores around the house when I'm stuck at home 24/7. And would I rather be remembered forever, and never know it. Or think I've had a profound impact and be forgotten after I'm gone.

Published in the 50s by Frankl, who was a Jewish psychiatrist who has went through the terrible ordeal of being a prisoner at Auschwitz during the Second World War.

The book is in two parts. The first is an account of his life at Auschwitz. He talks about daily life there as a prisoner, and he recounts the despair that touched so many of them and the large number of suicides.

In second part, he explains what was different between the prisoners who succumbed to despair, and those who kept faith/hope. His experience led him to theorize a type of therapy he called logotherapy. In a tiny nutshell, he claims that one has to find a purpose for living, and this purpose is what keeps one afloat during the thoughest moments.

That means everything that happens and can happen is 100% going to happen and re-happen, over and over again.

Having serious difficulties maneuvering newly found existential realizations.,"TL;DR – nobody, my 3 boys included, goes out on a passion pursuit, a vacation, or just off to their commute to work expecting or realizing their imminent destruction and non-existence is going to befall them, and now it’s all I ever think about, no matter how mundane the task at hand is. Is there a way to cope? 



*If you are interested in reading a bit more context, buckle in.* Two nights ago 3 of my friends were on their way home from a research trip when they hydroplaned on the highway into a semi-truck. All 3 were instantly killed. The oldest of the 3 was 22 years old; the youngest, just a teenager. 

The horrible grief of what happened still lingers, and their funerals are soon, but as I’ve come out of the shock of realization that they really are gone, I’ve been rattled by this realization (and to some extent, an appreciation) for/of my own mortality that I’m struggling to navigate, and was hoping someone here may have some form of valuable insight. 

I consider myself to have lived a generally well-examined life up to now, sitting quite comfortably with the knowledge of my own mortality as a simple fact of existence. I’m well beyond the fear of death itself, and in fact have a pretty persistent curiosity that serves to only better my relationship with the inevitably of non-existence. I’ve tried my best to use this knowledge to be as good of a person as I can be, and I love my current life.

My problem has arisen recently in the sobering realization of how immediate, unfair, and impactful it can be – *this tremendous anxiety and borderline depression of recognizing the fact that everything I love (and love life I certainly do) can become nothing more than past experiences some neurons caused before this weird flesh-thing I inhabit is struck down in an instant, me never knowing the wiser.* The issue isn’t dying - it’s the prospect of a sudden, brutal removal of my passions and all the opportunities of love, prosperity, and pain that could ever lie before me suddenly vanishing.

Edit: more detail, as requested, sorry that these ideas don't connect to each other so smoothly

The concept of suffering I borrow from Nietzche, suffering and any sort of indignity in our life leads us to a degree of self-contempt.  A degree of self-contempt is natural when we come to the understanding that at any given moment we could be doing absolutely anything, yet we may do only a tiny fraction of that. Self-contempt leads to anxiety and questioning what we are. Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom (Kierkegaard). When we question why we are what we are at this present moment, we come to the realization that we are more what others (i.e. parents, society) have made us, rather than the result of our own deliberate consciousness. This, in turn, helps us come to terms with the meaninglessness of the world around us and take charge, thus avoiding a life of bad faith (Sartre) and being able to define our essence. Only after facing the Absurd can we really truly come alive. 

Anticipation I borrow, quite generally, from my past experiences. When I am anticipating something, it, to me, is somewhat like a precipice. It makes me feel dynamic and that anything is possible. Anticipation helps us to avoid the drudgery of a static being. We need the sweet pain of anticipation to tell us that we are alive (Camus).",1

1633258458.0,This whole thing is insane.,"Existence is absurd. We don't know where the universe came from. We don't know how the universal forces came into being, or how quarks and energy were made. We don't know of the countless lightyears of space. Time is just a construct which is manipulated by gravity and other indescribable forces. We don't know how life began, or how consciousness works. We don't even know for a fact there is other life. We humans don't have free will, and are influenced and influencers of our environment. We love to live out these fantasy made up stories like God, human rights, laws and morality. We group ourselves in almost nonsensical categories. We are an ancient species, and so much of our time in existence is unknown and lost to the ages. We don't have souls and our ""identity"" is nothing more than our influences. We aren't anything separate from them. We are just molecules from nature and the universe, like a wave in an ocean, here one day, gone the next. Meaningless, meaningless, everything is meaningless.

We literally live on some random minuscule speck of dust which spins around a tiny tiny (yet immense) ball of fire, which in turn spins around  on an arm of a galaxy, which probably spins around something greater. And there's trillions and trillions of these galaxies each containing trillions and trillions of stars. We don't even know whats beyond the outskirts of the observable universe.

We don't know how the fuck we got here and were the fuck were going to. We are built to survive on this hyper specific planet, not even understand truth. We just got 80 years here to have fun, mess around, work, survive, suffer and die. Then where do we go? back to the void where everything came from? somewhere else? who knows. We don't know anything. Enjoy it i guess. How strange it is to be anything at all.

I'm not depressed or anything, just summing up the obvious i guess. This all just hit me so i felt the need to write it out and share it with someone. The whole thing is insane. THIS WHOLE THING IS INSANE.",1

1593279148.0,How the hell do you guys find interest in life?,"I’ve given a lot of thought as to “why reality exists”. I understand that “nothing ~~exists~~ matters”. I understand that there’s a sort of freedom that arises out of life’s meaninglessness. I get all that.

But over the past few years my interests have faded away, I’m not looking forward to my future, nor am I happy in the present. When it comes to “achieving” happiness, I’ve tried trying, I’ve tried not trying (effortless action described by Taoism/Zen), and I’ve tried trying to forget about it altogether. But I can’t find peace.

Basically what I’m asking is, how. If you were to wake up tomorrow depressed, how do you think you would work your way out of it?

1587958079.0,Does anyone else make themselves feel more distant from reality by thinking about how our reality only exists relative to our senses?," I know, this idea is nothing new. I just need a place to share what's driving me a little crazy.

I've been thinking too deeply about how reality exists only how we perceive it based on our senses biologically designed for us to perceive and what reality truly is, is something beyond comprehension because it goes beyond our senses and anything beyond our senses is beyond what we understand is our reality. We can't even use our senses to hypothesize reality but our only form of knowing comes relative to our senses, so we can't even begin to hypothesize because hypothesizing in itself is based on our blind perception of reality. So everything we've designed, the clothes we wear, the decorations in our houses, are all designs made in a reality we are blind to from all possible senses and forms of perception and are designed based on our liking relative to how we perceive whatever reality is beyond our senses...

Anyone else go through this thought process until they feel less real?",1
1663304962.0,Other people’s false sense of urgency is ruining my career.,"I’m being a tad melodramatic but only a little: so much of the “work” that happens in the real world is absolutely, unequivocally meaningless. To provide just one example—I recently had to complete general anti-harassment training, I’ve done this dozens of times in my life. I’m not pro-harassment but knowing this subject quite well I finished the “1 hour training” in about 20 minutes. Except it’s apparently mandatory that I spend a whole hour “doing” it so this app required me to sit at my computer, with the training material active in my browser, and click a button every 45 seconds for the rest of the 40 minutes to confirm I was still mindlessly staring in order to “fulfill the entire hour.” I’ll never get that 40 minutes of non-living back. 

It’s fine, I work in a field I really care about doing work I’m passionate about. Probably too passionate, because I want everything done well. When others around me insist on prioritizing “we’re going to get it done BY *~THIS DATE~* AT ALL COSTS!!!” and commit to completely arbitrary deadlines without considering whether it can be done successfully and well…I’m done. I can’t pretend this meaningless deadline matters AT ALL because it doesn’t—building meaningful, useful product is important, and if that can’t be done by the magic deadline who cares??? 

Of course, some people cope with their own existential dilemma by wrapping their ego up in everything they do, and that’s usually what’s behind this kind of controlling behavior: when the team bends to your will your importance and strength is validated. Look how effectively you “lead” [eyeroll]. What comes next is toxic finger-pointing, one doesn’t fear any sort of failure when it’s never one’s own fault. 

But the kicker: on a week when a whole team is working day and night to satisfy this false sense of urgency even though it’s forcing a terrible product, my company decided to launch a “reading club.” We are reading “Let my People Go Surfing,” which we all got a free copy of, about Patagonia’s ethical and successful business ethos. The absurdity is mind blowing.",1
1646586653.0,existential dread and crying every day. Help?,"A bit ago I got very sick and while it wasn’t a near death experience it exposed me to the fragility of my own body. 

Since then I’ve been contending with own mortality in an emotional way and not just playing a fun mind game with myself. I am very much attached to my life, my husband and all the joy I am lucky enough to experience. I truly love life and welcome suffering as part of it. I feel so grateful to have this experience and I’m pretty darn happy - especially when I see the cruelty and deep suffering around me. Suffering hasn’t missed me but I’ve never been enslaved or lost a child etc. 

However because of my love for life I deeply deeply grieve and mourn the end. I read a lot about physics, consciousness (consciousness under a anesthesia, coma etc) materialism, scientism and it seems - over and over again that these scientists and my findings hint to a nothing-mess. We die and that’s it. It’s as before we were alive. 

When I think this I feel like I’m punched in the stomach. I cry and feel like I’m grieving my own life, the idea of a nothing -ness feels too much to endure. It’s the most intense terror and sadness I’ve ever experienced. More than anything I want to go on, the part of me that retains some of these memories and joy and love.

1700782929.0,Every generation has to defend democracy forever,"I read a comment on Reddit a few days ago and it made realize what I’ve been wanting to avoid. 

I became very involved in politics since before the 2020 election, and this has caused me a lot more anxiety and existentialist issues. I’m a writer and filmmaker, and a very emphatic and sensitive guy. 

I’ve volunteered as an election clerk a few times now, and I’ve experienced very saddening and disappointing encounter with conservatives, mostly because I have an accent, I’m Mexican-American.

Why has politics become so extreme? I barely can go a day without checking the news, hoping to see something positive about the next election or justice being served to the former president.

And now I realize that the problem isn’t just about Trump winning, even if Democrats win for the next 20 years, the next time a Republican wins they will enact their so called “project 2025” plan. They just have to score once and the game ends. Why has the Republican Party become this way? 

Where is the empathy? Respect? Tolerance? 

But I guess this problem is inherent to Democracy and it will never go away. We have to defend it forever. 

I’m just tired, I have enough with my personal problems and conflicts to also worry about all of this I mentioned. It becomes overwhelming. 

Hope is a dangerous thing.

Please help.,"Just to avoid the topic, yes, I am mildly depressed, I do have mild PTSD from an emotionally abusive father, and I am treated, and on medication and in therapy. This is not why I am here, however.

I'm a 27 year old man who is my last year of my bachelors in I.T. (started at 24). I have a 4.0 in all my courses. I work out, eat right, cook and clean. All this, and yet I feel empty and hopeless/numb about everything I do.

For example, I attempt to read non-fiction books and my brain says, ""whats the point, you wont remember most of this and you will eventually forget all of it either through death, age, or a traumatic brain injury or something"".

Another example is learning another language. I have mild hearing loss and majorchearing loss runs in my family. My brain says, ""why bother spending all this time learning a language if you wont be able to hear anyone else. Even if you don't go deaf, my brain says, they are working on near perfect live translation tools that would void the benefits of knowing another language. 

No matter the scenario, my brain clings onto things and tells me that I will eventually not be able to do them if I get really into them, usually from a fear of going deaf, blind, etc. 

I believe it is a fear of losing something precious to me, so as a defense mechanism my brain won't allow me to grow attached to any one thing.

I know, I know, its better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all. Unfortunately,  even though years of mindfulness practice this sensation won't leave me.",1

I often catch a breeze in my sail and start looking for ways to pull myself out of this. Many times I find myself reading this sub and then I find myself reading the suggested books. Many of these books have helped people find purpose, find equilibrium and answers. Often I read them and I get nothing from them. I feel worse off because of that and ultimately land on the conclusion that I'm not intelligent enough to comprehend any worthwhile literature that could or may help me. I have to find cliff notes or someone else's interpretation of the material, which in turn never gives me any sort of realization or benefit from reading it. I don't feel as though *I've* learned or extrapolated anything of any purpose from this type of literature. The lessons never stick. 

Not even that alone, but outside of reading literature it happens as well. Say I do have a realization, a moment in time where my thoughts comfort me and give me peace, I often forget about it by the next day or by the next day the same words mean nothing to me.

 Im 26M and find that most people I know are primarily concerned with being ""successful"" in their attempts to achieve a certain level of economic prosperity. A big part of this motivation seems to be related to their desire to  provide for current and/or future offspring. It may also often relate to a desire to be seen as a mammal worthy of the praise of other members of society.

I'm not here to criticise people who are concerned with these everyday realities. I just find myself unable to share their concerns.

Sure I need to make money to eat and have a roof over my head. This fact doesn't mean that I want, or feel able, to devote mental energy to desiring ""success"" in relation to my ability to accumulate resources.  Most of my mental energy is, instead, spent pondering the absurdity of existence. This isn't necessarily a better   way to spend my mental energy but it's where I'm at!

1577780647.0,How I came to terms with my existential crisis,"Not sure if this will resonate with anyone, but I thought I'd share the way I rationalized living in spite of the depressing existential thoughts I was having.

In seeking absolute truth, we eventually hit an immovable boundary - death. What happens after we die? Well, there are many theory - an eternal afterlife, reincarnation, waking up from the simulation, etc. However, the problem is 1) we cannot know what happens unless we die, and 2) we cannot see if whatever is past death is also encapsulated within another context e.g. if we are in a simulation, how do we know if that simulation isn't also in another simulation? Therefore, the encapsulating contexts are potentially infinite - which means there is no way to know the absolute truth.

Consequently, if we will never know the truth, and we only have one life, we must choose how we want to live this life. Like many others who seem to cope well with existential depression, I choose to be happy and to create meaning.

What we don’t realize is that whether you are ignorant or intelligent, we all stem from the same origin. 

The process of destruction and creation can not be avoided no matter how hard we try. 

We look down on apes for how quick they are to get violent for such little reason. Yet, we humans are the inverse but the same. Most humans don’t get violent quickly for little reason only the more ignorant ones do which proves my point, but humans get more violent slowly over time for reasons we think are big but are small.

1638085149.0,We Exist. That's pretty much it.,"Lately I've had a powerful experience that I can honestly say was and still is both exciting, horrifying, and beautiful most of all. And all I did was really sit down and thought on the words ""we exist"". 

I know it sounds dumb at the surface, but after sitting down and taking it in, and I mean really taking it in, it honestly shook me to my core. The fact that I'm able to write this post right now with a sense of identity, knowing that I'm me and other people who read this are also aware of their own existence is absolutely insane. Existing to witness things with our own senses hits differently now. Listening to sounds, seeing beautiful colors in lights, and touching the ones you love have that extra layer of ""I am able to process this and interact with this"" attached to them and it's only truly percievable through your senses which stem from your existence at all.

 The idea of even being here is such a mind-blowing thing that it makes me think now about the bigger picture. I don't need to know the details, and Im not striving to find them out, but just the true comprehension of our existence at all makes me feel like theirs more than what we know. This is just my personal belief from all of this, but us existing at all has me hopeful for something later after death because if we are here and we know we are here, what is to say that we and the percievable universe around us is the limit?

I'm probably not doing my post justice since it might sound like a ""no shit"" moment to some of you, but I just wanted to share that being completely aware on being has given me a newfound appreciation for everything. I'm hoping that this outlook stays with me because it's honestly guided me towards bettering myself while I'm in this life, and I've already lost like 15 pounds and rekindled some old friendships/made new ones, but I feel that if I ever become comatose to life I can just call back on two simple words: ""We Exist"".",1

Guys… you know how many people have been told there’s a heaven and hell (a physical place where you go to based off of whether you do good or bad in this life). But what if heaven and hell exist right here on earth. As in the way we think and perceive our surroundings and everything that happens to us, essentially determines whether you are living in your “hell” or “heaven”. 

We could condition ourselves to view everything that happens either as having a positive impact or a negative one. I feel like we could change our mentality to fit one where we basically live our “best” life and view life’s real beauty.

I mean considering the possibility that we are existing right here on Earth, out of the bilions + planets that we know now to exist in this universe and to go through the entire process of evolution and be part of the the species of humans that survived evolution and to not die through the process of wars, the fact that just one of our ancestors could have decided to not have kids; all just to be alive today; and this entire process happened in an irrelevant time in comparison to the age of the universe. I mean the entirety of human civilisation has existed for less than the time of a blink of an eye. The chances of this happening are less than a one in trillion. To be you, alive right now, reading this. I don’t think we really appreciate the fact that we are here and how extremely lucky we are. We are just surrounded by systems put in place to control us and limiting us to thinking this is it that exists and not think beyond a certain capacity. 

I mean, in the bigger picture, what really js the point of exams and sitting at a desk and waiting and working and following a specific routine day and night, all for what. I guess if we did not really have these systems put in place there to control us, humanity will cease to operate. But will it though. Has anyone really stepped out of the whole system we were put into and taken a look at the bigger picture and thought what is this.

What if “heaven” and “hell” actually exists right here on Earth. But we just don’t realise it.

1629682582.0,"The bleakest philosopher of all time, Peter Wessel Zapffe, once argued that suicide is a natural response to the tragedy that is our existence. here's everything about him","[TL;DR, here's my video about him (thanks for the view btw)](https://youtu.be/tXIAGF16UVU)

Growing up in the midst of WW1, in neutral Norway, Peter Wessel Zapffe aspired to be a lawyer, the topic of justice fascinated him. When he came across the works of Arthur Schopenhauer his pessimistic philosophical journey started to take shape.

Years later, his work garnered him short-lived notoriety in the Norwegian philosophical community. His book, om det tragiske \[on the tragic\] characterized the human condition as one that involves the pursuit of justice in a lawless land. The same went for meaning and meaning, in a meaningless world.

He attributes this dynamic of suffering to our overly-developed intellect.

Peter Zapffe compared the human condition to that of [the Irish elk,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_elk) an animal that roamed the earth 14000 years ago before going extinct.

The speculated cause for its extinction: it evolved antlers that were too large, the animal could no longer hold up their heads or feed properly.

>“Suicide- a natural death of spiritual causes” -Zapffe

Just like the Irish elk, the evolution of the human brain/consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution.

This mutation lent humans a hyper-awareness that is different from any other animal, pigs don’t question their place in the universe, as far as we know, pigs don’t have a craving for meaning.

Man, however, wants to attribute a meaning to “cosmically mundane” events like the death of a loved human. Man wants to attribute a meaning to suffering, in order for the suffering to be justified.

Zapffe noted 4 ways humans cope with this existential dynamic:

[Isolation, Anchoring, Distraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe#Philosophical_work), [**and my personal favorite...Sublimation**](https://youtu.be/tXIAGF16UVU?t=379)**.**

From there on, Zapffe set forth to dedicate his life to the act of sublimation, till the day he died with the love of his life by his side, Berit Christensen.

1594031486.0,I have just realized the absurdity of life,"How does something come from nothing?   


We're so content with our understanding of our immediate world. How humans are made, how machines are made and how they work, how our laws of psychics works. Theories and understandings of why mathematical equations of our universe make everything beautiful.  But wait a minute, how the hell does something come from nothing?   


It's actually amazing that we've not all malfunctioned and killed ourselves. We're all just like ""yup. this is okay. It totally doesn't make sense how anything exists"". Somehow we've not all gone mad! That's the crazy thing.  


We're so obsessed with understanding, clarity and meaning. Yet some of the most simple and fundamental questions of life can not be answered with certainty! And we all seem to be okay with it.  


When the outbreak of a unheard of virus sweeps the world, together in our tribes we will go to mad lengths to determine the meaning of this virus. ""Bill gates did it! China did it! America did it! Bats did it!""   


""Have you ever thought about how absurd our existence is, how it doesn't make sense that something can come from nothing?"" - I guess for some, this question does send you to madness.   


**There is most definitely a ""creator"".... but it will be something we couldn't even imagine without our brains exploding. The ""creators"" reality will explain why something can come from nothing. My best guess is we wouldn't be advanced enough to interpret or understand the reality outside of our own... if we extend from it, an inkling of a suggestion would be exactly why we don't understand how everything ""just came to be"".**   


*Maybe a we one day give a Sim enough AI that it's able to work out that it thinks in ""1s"" and ""0s"". But how do you get that Sim to be aware of the Machine that is a computer which gives it life? Further more, how could you possibly begin to explain to that Sim what ""powers"" that computer. Electricity. FURTHER. How could a Sim of it's own accord come to realize anything complex about the organism which created the Machine (computer) which created the Sim itself? Maybe it one day becomes smart enough to understand that the machine is operable. How would it be possible to gather any understanding on our biological make up, unless we precisely give it that information? How is the Sim able to extend outside of the reality that it is confined to? A reality that it is confined to, and will cease to exist without the Machine that gives it life.*   


What could be knowledge available to us which might give us a suggestion to what life outside the Machine might be like? Well I suppose if we wanted a Sim to know what we looked like, we'd upload a photo and some information about ourselves in a language it could understand. Not something I've thought about deeply. But my best guess is psychedelic plants. The fact that we have created our own LSD, might mean that one day we are able to configure and understand the power of our brains enough to find out that there is indeed a Machine and it is operable. But unless our ""creators"" gave us direct information about themselves (whatever that would be, would be up for interpretation by the individual) how anything in our existence could possibly detect what operates the Machine that operates us  would be beyond me.  


But like I said, I presume that the truth is NOT human. And what I've written is a very human understanding of how something might work.

1588455488.0,What is confidence? And can any human with an honest view of the human experience really be “confident”?,"A conversation I had on reddit lead me to this question. 

I’m a human being.  A lonely one at that. I want intimacy, connection, sex. In fact I really have no control over wanting these things but that’s another discussion. 

I’ve been having trouble finding these things for years. I always ask for advice on Reddit and people constantly tell me “you just need confidence”. This is what women want to see. This what people in general are drawn to. *Confidence*. 

How can anyone honestly look around themselves and be confident about anything? I’m not even confident about what I am and certainly not confident about our speck of dust hurtling through the cosmos. How can I be “confident” when I’ve been placed in this place through no will of my own? To be honest the only confidence I have is that I’m going to disappear from this place one day. Is this the only true thing we can know? 

If confidence is what my animalistic search and drive for intimacy, sex, and connection is counting on then I’m pretty certain I will fail. Unless two things happen: 

1. I need to become a sort of cosmic actor and “fake it”. I don’t know if I can let myself be this inauthentic. Would it be morally correct to do this? Should I live a lie so I can put my dick into something? 

2. I need to erase my memory and become ignorant. Well I wish I was a droid with erasable memory banks or that hogwarts was real or something then

Sorry if this was dark. A lot of time I refrain from sharing these kinds of thoughts because I don’t want to bring others down with me but I also don’t think it’s healthy not to share. Certainly not going to with my Christian family in lockdown.

Edit: I’m open to the possibility that I just need to view confidence differently but when someone makes it sound so simple it’s very eye roll inducing",1

Most of them aren't going to make it, but for any of them to make it, all of them have to act as if they're going to make it. Each spore acts with this force behind it, a kind of fugal faith provided by the organism that if it pushes enough individuals far enough, something might land. It would be a problem if the spores awoke, were aware and looking around, calculating their odds and deciding it wasn't worth the effort and pain for such a slim chance. This is the problem of consciousness, as it's the source of both foresight and suffering. So what keeps (most) people from quitting? I mean, before fertilizer and healthcare your odds were even more slim. I've already been saved by modern medicine two or three times over.

We're not literally pushed from behind or carried on the wind, but most of us do have an inborn faith, or need for it, DNA pushing us from deep in the psyche to act as if we're going to make it. This faith doesn't have to be in anything overt like the fundamental decency and goodness of humans, the sanctity (or perversity) of american institutions, the patriarchy, manifest destiny or Vishnu the creator. Faith takes as many forms as there are crayon drawings stuck to refrigerators by little magnets, the same stories told over and over in a hundred different languages, the same hero with a thousand faces. It's a thousand but it's one. It's a story told about stories being told, about kids laughing, music playing, love and life.

But for whom is it true? As the population grows the number for whom this story is true is shrinking. As disparity grows, opportunity shrinks, increasing disparity, eliminating opportunity...an Ouroboros. And, lacking a belief that you'll live to see anything radically change, your faith is placed in the world, the system as it is. You believe in Democracy because you have to; thinking the world of your children will be worse than this is too depressing, so you drawn a picture in crayon and stick it to your brain. But the same faith which gives you the strength to solider on will be the very same psychosis that allows you to be manipulated into sacrificing yourself for someone else, acting or voting against your interests, or be misdirected from the real causes of disparity, etc. The unconscious mind is most of the brain's activity; they don't have to manipulate your intellect, only your faith, if you have it, and that's much easier.

He consistently uses apostrophes in words that end with an ‘s’ regardless of whether they need them (eg: need’s or thank’s).

It doesn’t bother me really, but it got me thinking.

To people unaware of a mistake they’re making, there is no issue - but to others with a higher level of understanding/awareness- there is.

If you unpack it further, it makes sense that although I understand the correct use of an apostrophe - there must be lots of other imperfections in my behaviour and conduct that I am not aware of but someone with an even higher level of awareness must notice.

Obviously it isn’t linear, for example our tradesman probably notices shortcomings in certain aspects of my life and thinks to himself ‘how does he get that so wrong?’.

1624260546.0,All we are is the thing that avoids the void,"Spending every moment trying to fill our experience with more power and control and feeling so that we can avoid slipping back into nothingness. And if we sink into familiarity, daydreams, automatic thinking, the same-old-same-old, we fall into nothingness again. I suppose the longing for transcendence or peace is the longing for death...but to live is to say ""fuck you"" to death at every opportunity. I guess it is Sysyphian, but the thought of greater control and wealth and sights and sounds drives us forward unceasingly without ending. This all sounds very pessimistic and depressing, probably, and I wish I could wrap this into something optimistic so that you had some take away to make you feel better. I think the only take away is that you can keep living, but it's going to be an unending challenge. 

I wish I had someone who I could really just break down completely towards, and I wish that I could just let my life go and float through like a parasite, just barely being conscious, hanging on like a baby who is adored for no reason other than it's cuteness. Instead I'm a grown man, and just hanging on is fairly pathetic to most people, and definitely not a good way to get a relationship and keep the respect of friends and family. So I'm at an impasse, like everyone else, and I have basically become a slave to positive behavior, because I know there isn't any alternative other than decaying death. That's kind of a weirdly optimistic thought though, isn't it? That we have no choice but to embrace positivity in order to cling onto this existence. 

Perhaps I'm just afraid of really, truly, embracing life and change, and am ruled by my myriad fears. Constantly defaulting to just being the 'quiet' guy so that I don't have to truly interact with the world and others and put myself on display and feel others judgement. And yet I keep taking wild steps forward in order to be a little more confident, a little more talkative, a little more social...because, like I said, all we are is that thing that clings onto existence instead of falling into the void. I don't want to fall into the void. There's really no greater fear than complete destruction of my mind and my world. 

Perhaps I just wish I was a person who had a better mastery of this existence. Could make people laugh on a dime, could connect with strangers effortlessly, could win respect and admiration with ease, could get women easily attracted to me, and could go for what he wanted. Instead I feel trapped and enslaved, at least to some degree. I feel jealousy towards people like my dad who seem so effortlessly able to connect with people, command a room, take social risks. I feel that deep down I am a pathetic individual, weak and unable to connect with anyone. Like the chaos of the world makes any semblance of a complete life just out of reach. But then the hedonic treadmill is that we never really reach that complete existence...

I suppose I'm just accepting that life is constant inner toil, an inner game and an inner struggle, reaching higher and higher towards something, constantly moving forward, not being able to take a step backwards. I've thought before that life is like the first Super Mario Bros. game, where you can go forward, but then it's impossible to go backwards. Life pushes us forward without any hope of going back to the past and changing things, and we're left in a new, scary world that we have to organize and make sense of. 

This might sound fairly whiny, but it's cathartic for me. I realized that I AM going to keep striving and pushing forward, as there is no other solution. In every situation, I'm going to keep embracing my fears and trying more and more, to do a bit more, to talk a bit more, flirt a bit more, connect a bit more, because all I am is that growing thing.

I hate how our genes made us stigmatize suicide just for the sake for their own selfish survival. I think the average lifespan is way too long, life would be boring and painful at some point. You will slowly lose lot of your intellect capacity and watch many of the people you love die while you are getting some fatal diseases and slowly suffering until death, I can’t see why would anyone enjoy life with all this suffering.

The main advice I’ve come across is “Choose who you want to be, what the best version of yourself looks like, then go be that person and live that reality.” But how do you decide who that person is?

There seems to be no baseline, no framework, no guiding light with which I hold as true (at least beyond the sheer absurdity of life). For some their religion offers enough guidance to hold them up even when times are tough. For others their parents or a dear family member instilled a strong ethical code or idea of life that has stuck with them. Some chase happiness, some chase adrenaline, some chase highs, some chase anything but the lows. Others seek power or money or material possessions. All of these people going about their lives with a sense of purpose, for better or worse, while I sink further down the rabbit’s hole of uncertainty and indecision.

I mean it’s remarkable really, the sheer amount of different lives that can be lived. There’s teachers, poets, police officers, lobbyists, truck drivers, clowns, writers, readers, singers, and listeners. There’s Christians, Muslims, Jews, Mormons, Buddhists, Taoists,  and atheists. There’s lovers and fighters, jokers and smokers, uptight assholes and carefree dudes, risk-takers and risk-averserers.

You can be a church-goer who coaches his kids little league team or you can abandon religion altogether and try to be the cool uncle. You can please everyone else or even not think of others in the slightest. These are all choices we can make.

What separates existentialism from the useless and vague descriptor of nihilism is that an existentialist recognises that there is no essential meaning in life, but that’s okay because we can form subjective meanings for ourselves to get us through the bullshit.

And another thing dipshits: Camus said that Sisyphus could find carrying his boulder up the mountains for eternity bareable by being happy if he focussed in on being the best goddamn boulder-carrier he could. 

In other words, he carved meaning out of his otherwise meaningless life. That’s how we imagine Sisyphus happy. There you go.

This is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of superior density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, good life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

This is now starting to become more obvious, more absolute. Throughout history man has been seeking not for meaning, but a way to survive without meaning. A way to live with suffering. To this end then, maybe the existential way of thinking is more liberating, if you could create a worthy purpose that helps one through their suffering. 

There is no purpose that can withstand a great suffering with no sight in end, no matter how important or noble the purpose. There will always be a breaking point. So it is down to each individual to create meaning in their lives that sustains life beyond the suffering they will encounter.

For some, this realization may not come soon enough, the chosen purpose isn't sufficient. This can be extremely difficult to deal with. One can't just alleviate suffering from depression, loneliness, rejection, social anxiety and other illnesses so simply. If a purpose doesn't sustain these, then the very thought of existing beyond the day is dreadful.",1

1610488173.0,Said my farewells in my diary,"My mood recently was quite down. Today I thought a lot about life, what I want from it and obviously if it even matters, what If I randomly die soon? you know the whole package.

I started a diary recently and the thought about death gave me an idea to write down some things for people that I care about to read if I go(hoping someone finds it in my desk).  Something like a will but the only thing I was giving away was my real emotions and feelings.

This random exercise really changed my mood. I wrote down things addressing my sister, brother, my female friend whom I have feelings for but hadn't had a chance to express them yet, all my other friends that mean a lot to me.

Being dull last couple of days, when writing this I felt a lot. I realized how many people play a big part in my life, and realized I play a part in theirs. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a super popular person with hundreds of friends, but I've even left some lines for people I only met recently but had fun with and appreciated them. 

I think realizing how much we have(of non materialistic stuff) is a big key to being happy.
On paper saying ""Thank you"" to so many people made me realise that maybe some people feel like that about me too?

Now it would be great to sometimes express those feelings and not wait untill you die for people to find out you appreciate them. Unfortunately I'm still working on being more open, some childhood trauma really put some locks on, but I'm getting there slowly.

Just a little thought I wanted to share.

We live in an unfathomably large and unforgiving cosmos, utterly indifferent to our survival. Our existence is only validated to each of us through our senses to perceive reality and the memories we make, which will one day fail us.
Long after we perish from this world and we are forgotten by those who remain and come after us, the earth will continue to spin, the sun will still rise and set, society will continue to change and evolve – for better or worse, and the universe will continue to be a chaotic mess.
On this cosmic scale, a vast and seemingly endless void, speckled with beauty, destruction, and a lifespan so incomprehensible that when compared to our own lifespan, our presence and our actions have no far-reaching consequences. By viewing our existence compared to such a great extent, we quite literally live in the moment on this cosmic clock.
Several billions of individuals, each one made up by a very specific and unique arrangement of atoms, each going about their daily lives, finding joy in these routines, and desperately searching for meaning and purpose among the chaos. All of us. Here “-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam” (Carl Sagan)
The sentience we've been given as a result of our existence may be random and even inherently meaningless. Through this realisation we are liberated to seek our own meaning, even if ultimately the universe is to end when our consciousness ceases.
Nothing is real, our perception is our own reality and we’re guided by our senses that will fail. How can we be certain that what we perceive is absolute?
Everything is temporary, all things will end. From the lives we lead, to the relationships we forge, all the way to the universe itself.
And that’s okay, we are free to happiness in this chaos upon which our time is very limited. And that makes the journey that much more worth it. For the memories we make, to prove to ourselves, that yes, we do exist.",1

1599700362.0,"Do we choose values and meaning, or only discover them?","Much of existentialism appears to be based on these two quotes from Sartre:

* ""We are condemned to be free"" - we not only *can* choose, we *must* choose.
* ""Man first exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world - then defines himself afterwards"", aka ""existence precedes essence""

These ideas lead to the assertion that meaning and value can only be chosen by the individual, and that in fact we must make those choices, as there is no alternative.

I've noticed that most things I've read about existentialism (including posts and comments on this sub) seem to portray this ""choice"" of meaning/value as being 100% free, in the sense that the choice is completely arbitrary and uninfluenced by anything at all, internal or external to the individual.

However, this doesn't seem logical to me, or in line with my personal life experiences. It seems self-evident to me that any ""choice"" I make is going to be subconsciously and/or externally influenced by a myriad of factors, including my personality, obligations, responsibilities, knowledge, beliefs, neurochemistry, environment, culture, upbringing, life experiences, other people, society, laws, etc... I might have some level of conscious control over it (certain neuroscience experiments suggest that we can't choose actions, only veto them at the last moment), but I certainly don't seem to have 100% conscious, uninfluenced control.

For example, sport has no value or meaning to me personally (i.e. I don't like it), despite several attempts over the years to try to like/enjoy various sports. It's been that way since I was a small child. I simply cannot choose to value it. I don't value it, and I can't seem to change that.

Given the above, it seems to me that I can't really **choose** my values or meaning, but only **discover** what they are. Or as Schopenhauer put it: ""A **man can do what he wants**, but not **want** what **he wants**.""

Is this in line with existentialism? Or have I misunderstood something?",1

Existentialism seems to have swept him under the rug without challenging or celebrating any of his ideas.,"I just finished reading *On The Heights Of Despair* and was completely captivated by it. This series of poetic essays shook me in a way I can't really articulate. It almost felt like the reading of this book scratched an existential itch that I didn't know I had. It's dark, raw, uncomfortably honest, with just enough humor and wit to keep me turning the page. 

At my girlfriends Christmas party I bumped into her uncle who works in the philosophy department at a university and whom I knew harbors a personal love for existentialism. So I showed him the book and asked if he was familiar, and he had never heard the name. 

For anyone who enjoys Camus*' Myth of Sisyphus*, this plays around with many of the same themes but takes them to places I think even Camus would have been uncomfortable with. It feels closer to Schopenhauer's perspective, just a few shades more depressing. For anyone already existentially depressed, there is a silver lining to be found for you in the book, for those who think they are happy with life; **do not read this book.** 

 “I hate wise men because they are lazy, cowardly, and prudent. To the philosophers' equanimity, which makes them indifferent to both pleasure and pain, I prefer devouring passions. The sage knows neither the tragedy of passion, nor the fear of death, nor risk and enthusiasm, nor barbaric, grotesque, or sublime heroism. He talks in proverbs and gives advice. He does not live, feel, desire, wait for anything. He levels down all the incongruities of life and then suffers the consequences. So much more complex is the man who suffers from limitless anxiety. The wise man's life is empty and sterile, for it is free from contradiction and despair. An existence full of irreconcilable contradictions is so much richer and creative. The wise man's resignation springs from inner void, not inner fire. I would rather die of fire than of void.”

Now, how much of that unmeasurable matter belongs to things that would be considered ""alive?"" Quite a bit, however the ratio of ""alive-matter"" to ""not-alive-matter"" is rather mind boggling, by anybody's simple observation, there is much much more matter that is not alive than there is matter that is alive. Now, also take into account the amount of ""alive-matter"" that is ""councious-matter""(defined by the ability to contemplate their position in the universe, and ponder at the meaning of existence), the only such concious matter that we are aware of, is us. Now, the amount of ""Concious-matter"" in relation to ""not-alive-matter"" is staggering. Like a drop in a bottomless ocean. And congratulations, if you're reading this, you have won the only lottery that counts, you are concious. However with consciousness comes things like basic needs and emotions. For example we are social primates, we need social interaction to make it in this life, we will always feel lonely even in a room of people simply because we are evolutionarily required to crave socialization. Now, why is sadness beautiful? Well, being apart of the only known concious beings has it's perks, for example, we are able to define sadness, we are able to put into words how we feel, when we feel it. We are able to express this sadness in a myriad of different ways. Now, what do you think the chances are of your matter being arranged so intricately that you pop out? Nigh impossible. Contemplating the incredible odds that you have beaten simply to be able to live, will drive anyone to a new sense of appreciation for life. You can see the ""beauty of the odds"" when you look at anything in life, from the orbit of planets to the intricacy of leaves. You should revel in your emotions simply because you have no control of when they happen, you are only here for such a short amount of time and you should make the most of it. When you're happy, be happy, and when you're sad, be sad. Of all of the matter of the entire universe, how much of it do you think has the pleasure of feeling sad? Sadness is nothing but a reminder of what happiness is. Sadness is such a rare occurrence throughout the Cosmos, and if we are condemned to live, and observe the seeable universe, then why shouldn't we see the beauty in sadness? Sadness has been the driving point of art, literature, cinema, and political movements. All of which are beautiful things. If the outcome of something often seen as bad, is beauty, then what is stopping that same thing from being beautiful itself?

I’ll get into that existentialism headspace and be stuck there for the whole day second guessing every thought and body movement.  Do you ever just lay there and think about how absolutely crazy it is that we are creatures that can move limbs on demand, it takes less than a millisecond for me to decide to move my leg and for it to actually happen. It’s just so unbelievable that we’re possible, that everything on this planet is possible. Ill spend a whole day squeezing my hands closed and just thing wtffff HOW, WHY this shit is crazy. People think ‘oh no mermaids, unicorns, that huge fish conspiracy thing there’s no way that’s possible’ like bro come on it’s not like I necessarily believe in those things but if we as humans and as complex as our brains and bodies are, then literally anything else can be possible, it’s really not that far fetched. Especially because it’s all atoms, we’re just matter formed together in such a specific way, and on top of that our matter and mix with someone else’s and we can make an entirely other human with their own matter but they will be completely different in their own way.

1658249304.0,Existential Dread on top of existential dread.,"I'm in my 50's now and I have sought meaning my whole life.  Over the years I have found meaning in some things.  Such as learning a new skill, sharing knowledge with someone younger, love, etc.  However, the larger things have always maintained their grip over me.

For most of my life, that dread was just the meaningless of it all.  Realizing that nothing I accomplish will truly amount to anything and contemplating my death.  But in the past few years I have acquired a new dread on top of these.  That being that I feel like humanity and life on earth is quickly approaching an ending.  I see unimaginable suffering in the near future.  But, everyone is just treating it as business as usual.

Rivers across the globe are drying up.  Here in the US the Colorado River will no longer be able to produce electricity as early as next July.  A recent study found that 90% of the plankton in the Atlantic ocean have disappeared.  I can keep going but things are dire.  And there is literally nothing that I can do about it.  If Humanity has any hope of surviving another 100 years we must take drastic action.  And we all know that we won't.  We would much rather argue about political parties and continue to buy knick knacks.

1675496567.0,"Human consciousness did the opposite of what evolution intends, explained by grass","I recently watched a YouTube video by popular historian lindybeige, [here](https://youtu.be/6ClQXwkkH8A)

He was asking why all plants aren’t poisonous since the plants that are poisonous have developed that trait as a defence (to stop themselves being food) so why haven’t more or all species of plant developed it too? Particularly with grass since it’s the worlds biggest food source for animals both wild and domestic.

Lindybeige surmises that “evolution is not a force towards the optimum, it’s a force towards the minimum necessary”. Grass is able to reproduce perfectly well without the need to be poisonous (I’m aware how blasé this is about evolution but interesting nonetheless) therefore grass never needed to become poisonous.

Humanity’s conquering of the planet in evolutionary terms is well documented and can be fully explained and even timestamped, but at some point along the way we developed out of our natural remit. We became self aware, we developed critical thinking, we started accelerating our development far beyond our remit to do so and without thought to the consequence. We are now destroying the world that spent millions of years developing us because it made one mistake - waking us up.

I realise that sounded preachy and I would hate the guy that said that to me at a party but the reason I wanted to post this is because I think that even if we stayed in caves, stayed round the fireplace and hunted with sticks and rocks - just by being conscious and aware we would have disrupted natural order, humans can make conscious choices about whether to hunt, migrate, breed, settle. Shit even make a choice about what they want for dinner. I think the fact that we are able to do that on a whim or idea and not some preprogrammed logic / nurture from parents - we immediately disrupt natural order and ruin the way of life as it is.

Maybe evolution is destined to fail so it can start again, maybe this is the great filter, maybe I’m just talking shite. I just morbidly enjoyed thinking about all this and wanted to share it.

Edit: thanks for all the replies, I enjoyed reading them.

1627262123.0,My experience with the abyss.," **TL;DR:** don’t look away from the abyss. Persist. It pays off. At least it did for me.  


**Disclaimer:** I'm not a hardcore philosophy nerd, I just study enough to ease my personal afflictions.  


**""If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you"".**

You all know this phrase, I just want to share my personal experience with it. I probably heard it the first time when I was in highschool or something, but I was too busy with adolescent stuff, so I didn’t really paid attention to it. I would only come back and meditate about it in college, as life started to hit a little harder.

I was born and raised in a very believer country (the term “religious” wouldn’t contemplate it), so existential crises aren’t really a thing, for most people existence is sufficiently explained and justified already (this is not criticism, it’s just how things are). This obviously affected my relations, I got distant from parents because they couldn’t understand what was wrong with me, I was a bad friend thanks to my constant bad mood, and most importantly: it really f\*cked up my love life.  
I consider myself a romantic guy, not in the “bouquet and serenade at the window” way, it’s more like “the life as a single doesn’t do it for me” way. So I’m always off looking for someone to share my life with and form deep bonds. Blend that with an existential void and you’ll have a young man hurting a lot of girls as well as himself. In case anyone here doesn’t know: expecting your partner to fill the hole in your soul is almost the same thing as calling your dealer and asking for a crack rock the size of the universe in a serious tone. Yeah. Not good. Don’t do it.  
As you can imagine, I became more and more isolated within time. I didn’t want to hurt anyone anymore and didn’t know where to look for a solution for my problems. Even therapy wasn’t doing much. The only thing that helped me was to write myself to sleep. I used to open a new doc and just spit the words as raw as they appeared in my mind. I did it so much it became a habit and it wasn't too long until the tempest of words began to take shape and form a sea of feelings. I didn’t feel like it would solve anything, but at least made the problem more palpable.

That’s how most of my days went: laying in bed, staring at the ceiling thinking about sh\*t or in my chair, eyes on the computer screen, writing about sh\*t.

One day, there I was,  laying in bed once again. I wrote that phrase on the ceiling with my imagination and, to my surprise, something else wrote itself below it:

**""If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you…**  
**…but if you keep staring long enough, the abyss you get shy and go away”.**

“What does that even mean?”, I thought to myself. Today it feels so obvious it’s almost dumb, but at the moment I actually had no idea. The only thing I knew is that, deep down, my subconscious was trying to tell me something. So I began trying to listen to it more.  
What I did was, basically, hear my own desires. The deepest of them.  
By doing this I realised I had many both noble and dark ones I never stopped to think about. Many of them made me feel ashamed and were repressed by self-taboos for no good reason. I also realised seeing “noble” and “dark” as a dichotomy locked them in an immobilizing antagonism. And, finally, what’s even worse: I saw that, there, inside this locked up and repressed desires, was my will to live.  
I reflected on that for a while and what I learned is that, to put in simple terms, noble and dark desires are not opposites, they complement each other. All you have to do is learn to channel them the right way. That’s a skill I’ve been trying to perfect in the last few months and, boy, did the abyss shy away.

Note: there’s a bunch of suppressed info in these last 2 paragraphs, I wouldn’t mind talking about them, but it’s more sensible and NSFW stuff which most of you wouldn’t be interested in, I believe. Besides, this post is too long already.

Different Species, organisms, emerging to evolve- some flourish and grow, some get eaten up or disposed of by others. You have to compete and hurt others to be able to evolve.

So the species that is evolving further wants to literally live on planet earth even if its nature is just full off torture, but at the same time you’re forced to act because of survival needs. So are we literally choosing to continue and live in this hell? 

There may be some who haven’t experienced much trauma and may not grasp how dark reality gets, and there may be those who have experienced a great amount of trauma from torturous cruel events. I may be being very pessimistic, but just the fact that the word even allows this to exist is insane.

I almost always have vivid dreams (mostly positive ones), I draw a lot, I consume a lot of art and I really like following ''my story'' - I just invent lots of things to give a certain kind of ''meaning'' to my life. I listen to a lot of music, watch movies and anime, and love reading. I just looove that our brains allow us to have this trait called imagination. It's a gift of consciousness and I really wish it could be like that forever.

But it can't. Someday, it will all end. My life will end. And even though nobody knows what happens after death, the most likely thing is we cease to exist. How disappointing. I won't be able to see the future. I won't be able to have technological breakthroughs that will enable us to space travel. I will never see if there are aliens or not. I will never see the colonization of the other planets. Many answers of the universe will be left unanswered. But I'm here. And I have to live and keep having fun, but sometimes I just get sad. 

I just feel like a naive person. All of these things, the afterlife, the divine, the ''unifying essence'', thinking in terms of energy, we are spiritual beings, quantum immortality, cryonics, anti-aging medicine, simulation theory, etc I try to believe in. All of that just feels like wishful thinking in the end. But I can't fear life. I have to live and enjoy it as much as I can. We already have many things to enjoy, TV shows, cellphones, music, etc. But it just feels bad that I might never see this futuristic world that I envision in my head. 

How do you cope with this fact? That life is so insanely short and fragile and that we might never see the huge accomplishments humanity can bring even in only 300 years?

I needed to write this. Life is beautiful, it really is. But it's so damn short. And nonexistence is scary, but inevitable. I want an afterlife, but what I want will not influence existence in the slightest.",1
1654826931.0,A short story written on a flight with a crying baby,"As I remove my headphones I am met with the sound of a baby's screams. My in-flight movie has been interrupted by a safety video. We still haven't taken off yet, haven't even begun to move. There are people not far from here who will spend the night without a roof over their head, yet I am free to access in-flight entertainment before the flight has even begun. What a wondrous world we live in - or it would be, if not for the toddler's cries and the interruption of the safety video. In it a cartoon child is seated in a cartoon airplane, awaiting some inevitable cartoon disaster to befall him followed by an equally inevitable (and instructive) cartoon solution. It is the happiest child I've ever seen on an airplane. Certainly happier than the very not-cartoonish baby seated two rows ahead. I could put my headphones back in and listen to the instructions, perhaps drowning out the baby's wails. But I pause to listen for a moment.

&#x200B;

The baby's cries are discomforting, annoying, evoking a primal anxiety within me that for some ancient ancestor may have once served a functional purpose. Some force within compels me to silence the boy's wails, but my condition prevents me, being trapped in a distant seat. Were I closer, maybe I could give some assistance, or guilt his parents into taking firmer action. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some part of me that wished death upon the boy and his parents for inflicting this torture upon me and my fellow passengers. Maybe I'll even get to witness it myself, if anything like the events transpiring in the safety video were to occur.

&#x200B;

But does the child really deserve to die? The parents do of course, on that we can all agree. But I can't help but sympathise with the baby's plight. He did not choose to board this plane, any more than he chose to be brought into this world. It's easy to assume the baby is crying for some shallow selfish reason, because he's hungry or tired or uncomfortable, but is that really the whole story? Perhaps the baby doesn't cry because he is hungry, but because he has been torn from a state of nonexistence where hunger did not exist, cursed with feelings of desire and discomfort imposed upon him against his will.

&#x200B;

And now his parents, those who inflicted upon him of that most horrible of curses, life, attempt to subdue him, to break his will, to silence his rightful protest against the injustice they have wrought upon him. They offer him a pacifier. They offer him a nipple. They try to feed him, to distract him with toys and games, to rock him to sleep... But he refuses all. The baby understands what the rest of us choose to ignore - that, like life, this will be a long, uncomfortable and joyless flight from which there can be no escape but death.

&#x200B;

The safety video continues. The unreasonably happy cartoon child learns what to do in case of each type of emergency. He smiles his cartoon smile as his cartoon father places an oxygen mask over his cartoon face; he greets a cartoon flight attendant while boarding a cartoon life raft; his absurd cartoon optimism doesn't leave his face even as he braces for impact in a cartoon crash landing. This is no mere safety video; it is propaganda, designed to distract us from the utter horror of our reality, from the inevitable approach of death and our absurd hope that we can evade it. It is also propaganda aimed at demonising the crying baby, whose wails threaten to remind us of terrors much more unpleasant than a mere plane crash. For if this cartoon child can accept the human condition, what right does the baby have to protest it?

&#x200B;

Yet in spite of the propaganda the baby is winning me over. I realise now what I failed to see before. This baby isn't an annoyance; he is a Messiah, come to remind us of the blissful nonexistence from which we came and the indignation we should feel at being torn from it. And like any true Messiah, he is demonized by the powers that be. Hence the cartoon; no, not just a cartoon, it is an anti-Christ, sent to keep us all in cartoon ignorance! I turn away from the screen again, this time not out of boredom but out of disgust, and listen instead to the wisdom of the baby.

&#x200B;

But though I listen, his prophetic warnings go unheeded by most. The other passengers hear only the screams and not the secret truths they contain. Their glares and sighs signal to the mother that she'd better get her act together. After all, the role society expects parents to play is two-fold: they are the executioner, ensuring the child's death by cursing them with life; but they are also the prison warden, disciplining the child into quietly and obediently accepting their time on death row.

&#x200B;

The mother understands her maternal duty: the child must be silenced by any means necessary. She intensifies her efforts. ""Do you want some pretzels?"" A foolish gambit. For how could the taste of such dry, salty carbs possibly compare to the sweet, warm embrace of the void? The boy will not be swayed by such a transient vice. He doesn't want your pretzels, he wants only to return to the womb and the eternal slumber that preceded it.

&#x200B;

The propaganda video ends. Rejoice! We are all now prepared for any emergency. Except, there's one emergency the film did not address. What if, instead of crashing, the flight should proceed smoothly, bringing us all safely to our destination and a return to the life awaiting us on the other side? Would that not be the worst emergency of all, the true horror? Yet it's the only one for which the cartoon has no answer. And so it is simply omitted, as all propaganda omits those things it would prefer the viewer to forget.

&#x200B;

But the baby cannot forget. His young life forces him to remember what time has allowed the rest of us to bury: the trauma of being torn from a dreamless slumber and being placed in this mortal coil. We adults only recall the echo of that trauma, if we haven't suppressed it completely, but for him it must still be so fresh. How could he not cry? He wails, he screams in agony, he strains every fibre of his vocal chords, not because it will bring him any relief, but because he knows relief without death is an illusion, because he is compelled to protest against his condition while he still can, even if it's in vain. His screams only get louder as we take to the air. For a few transcendent moments the child's is the only voice to be heard. The mother has failed, and his resistance is unbroken. The floor is his.

&#x200B;

But the forces of conformity will not be so easily defeated. Reinforcements have arrived; flight attendants approach to solve the problem themselves. They have faced countless such protests from countless young souls, and have never failed to suck the will out of every one. Every means available within this airborne prison will be mustered against the boy and his subversions. One attendant returns wielding that most effective and lethal of pacifiers: the biscuit. They attempt to seduce the child with its promise of saccharine relief. Initially the child ignores it. Then he outright refuses it. He bats at it, turns away, his cries unhindered. I watch with baited breath. A moment of hope? Will this baby succeed where the rest of us have failed?

&#x200B;

Alas, though a Messiah he may be, he is not free of temptation. The colourful wrapping catches his eye. The cries slow as the boy becomes hypnotised by the allure of the biscuit. For but a moment he falters... but a moment is all they need. In an instant it has been unwrapped, the once defiant prophet now eagerly biting into it. Like a bullet, small but deadly, the biscuit offensive has succeeded. Humanity has lost, dethroned in the mind of the baby by base material desire. With the moment of opportunity opened, his enemies will not allow his campaign of enlightenment to resume. As soon as the biscuit is finished it is followed with a juice box. Then a toy. Even the previously-refused pacifier is now palatable to the baby, his spirit thoroughly subdued as the sugars rush through his veins, conquering his body and mind. Within 5 minutes he is playing games on a screen, silently sorting coloured shapes into corresponding boxes. To consume and to work; his capitalist disciplining is complete. The mother has earned some respite; her constant attention is no longer required, for the boy himself has accepted his condition. He will continue to consume and to produce independently now, thoroughly indoctrinated, as all the rest of us will when we return to our post-flight lives.

&#x200B;

The threat undone, the attendants resume their routine. A cart filled with snacks is wheeled down the aisle; though the child's rebellion must be cut down as a matter of urgency, the latent rebellion in all the rest of us must also be sated, lest we begin to cry out as well. My own turn inevitably comes. ""Pretzels or biscuit?"" For a moment I consider refusing both as a show of solidarity with the boy. But how could I succeed where even the Messiah has failed? I take the biscuit. I unwrap it and consider it for a moment, lying naked and alone on the vast emptiness of the seat-back table in front of me. The biscuit feels no compulsion to cry out... but unlike ours, its journey is mercifully short. One swift movement, hand to mouth, and it is returned to the void, as we all will be some day.

&#x200B;

As it dissolves into nothingness on my tongue, I look ahead and see that the baby is now fast asleep. The sugars begin to enter my system. ""Tasty,"" I think, and return to my movie.",1
1634602806.0,God doesn't give meaning to life,"Tell me what you think about my Statement:
The universe as a whole is meaningless no matter if a God exists or not.

Why I think that:
In my opinion a system can only be given a bigger meaning by something outside of it. A system can't give itself a meaning because that would create a circle of reasoning making the whole system meaningless again.  Saying a system can give itself meaning is like saying that sysiphus (the guy in Greek mythology, who was doomed by the gods to push a rock up a mountain only for it to roll down so he could do it all over again for all eternity)  lived a meaningful life. One could argue that his reason to exist was to push the rock up the mountain and the reason for the rock to exist was to be pushed up a mountain by sysiphus only to roll down again. But that doesn't give the system as a whole a bigger meaning, it's still senseless. The meaning only comes in place when you bring something outside of the system into play: The Gods punished sysiphus. The meaning behind his endless suffrage is punishment.
Given that a system can only get a bigger meaning from outside of it, leads us to this:
A potential god could give humans a purpose, a meaning, but he couldn't give himself one. The only way Gods existence could get meaning is from a God of God, because he created everything else and his creation surely can't give him, the creator, a meaning. But then again: The God of God wouldn't be able to give himself meaning either.
And given that God can't give himself a meaning, rises the next Problem:
If Gods existence has no meaning then what meaning could a potential purpose he gave to us humans have?
No meaning at all! If you say: My purpose is to worship God, but Gods existence is meaningless, then that means God being worshipped is meaningless, which in turn would make your purpose meaningless.
If we look at the example of sysiphus again it's the same: Earlier I said Sysiphus meaning was punishment, but if we look at the bigger picture this meaning fades into nothingness. Because if the gods don't have a reason to exist, then them punishing Sysiphus is also meaningless, which in turn makes the construct as a whole senseless again. Sysiphus pushing a rock up a mointain is mainingless if you look at the whole picture.

That all said: Even tho life has no bigger meaning doesn't mean you can't live a happy, but inherently meaningless life until you fade into the nothingness you were born from.",1
1617111875.0,Can only the powerful/the strong be fully authentic?,"We are all bound to norms and ideas within historical contexts that serve the purposes of groups of power/the so called ""strong"" - even the new generations of the strong themselves, but they have the least restraints in expressing their beings and fulfilling themselves.

Thus, they don't need develop slave morality/sentiments like approval seeking (Nietzsche describes in the Genealogy of Morality the sentiment of vanity as the combination of the tendency of the masters to think highly of themselves and the tendency of the slaves to need and seek the validation of others).

I always tried to be authentic in powerless situations. It's difficult and even if I manage to do it, I don't feel free or don't feel fully integer.

After all, I feel that I can only be truly myself if I can do/I can have what I want with no restrictions. Sure, one can compromise and be authentic in harmony with others in order to fulfil a more urgent need or goal, but even then you're not your truest self.

Yet, I also think that authenticity which is engendered only by abundance/power can also be a fake authenticity, because you're never absolutely powerful. There's always somebody more powerful preying on you. When he or she conquers you, you might behave like a slave... unless, of course, you learned to be or at least feel authentic under constraints. So, when you're free/powerful, your authenticity is genuine. 

What do you think? Is your truest self achieved in power or in powerlessness?

Edit: 
I'm starting to think that genuine authenticity is achieved by both dealing with powerlessness while NOT being somebody who you aren't and ALSO by increasing power (over yourself and others), getting options to have what you want. Besides, DentedAnvil argues that  ""'whether real, genuine authenticity is found in power or in powerlessness' is a false dichotomy. Neither condition is absolutely required or absolutely prohibitive of authenticity"". It's about finding self-content in who you can be in the degree your own possibilities allow it, in refusing to be who you're not or you don't want to be(come).

1615541175.0,"Nietzsche’s Abyss and the observational self, how nothingness gazes into you","One of the quotes I can’t get out of my mind is Nietzsche’s ‘If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you’. Something about it is so deeply unsettling

Most of you are probably familiar with the observational self, it’s your presence. Some call it a soul or a spirit. It doesn’t think nor has any identity, it just witnesses your human self go about their daily business. Personally I feel like it is very akin to void, you can’t actually interact with it. No matter how much pain or suffering you are in, it’s always just in the backseat. Eerily observing 

Metaphorically speaking I ‘gazed into the abyss’ a long time ago. Through continuously doing so, the ravine between me as a ‘biological machine’ and as an ‘eery presence’ felt more gaping the longer my gaze lingered. 

Say If our spiritual presence/ soul has the same qualities as abyssal void, that fits into the quote quite perfectly. ‘If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you’
What if gazing into the abyss is our morbid curiosity of exploring the nothingness within our world and within ourselves, we begin to notice the presence of the same abyss within ourselves. And feel it’s gaze, staring back at us 



This is of course a very subjective experience. You might not agree our presence has abyssal qualities. To me it rings true, when this hit me it felt like something underneath shifted into place. The eerie feeling this quote gave me years ago is the same feeling I experience every time I experimented with my observational self. 

This feels like jumping to conclusions and maybe a bold statement( but you know it’s Reddit so oh well) I think obsessing over my observational self made some of its qualities bleed into me. I often feel apathetic and idle, there’s little things that feel like they ‘breathe life into me’. It’s in its subtleties, I’m not massively depressed nor stating I’ve somehow turned into a hollow husk. Though generally speaking, it takes me more of an effort to engage myself with the world and I’m somewhat disinterested in doing so in the first place.

I don’t think there’s an absolute truth there, but I am fairly confident that engaging with nothingness has a strange effect on our subconscious. 
This whole thing is conflicting to me, I most value the pursuit of truth as well as life itself

If this observation has some truth to it, we might be inadvertently encouraging our own entropy",1
1604069836.0,"Some book recommendations for everyone, especially newer philosophers","After browsing this subreddit it looks like existentialism continues to be heavily misunderstood. If you're interested, here are the best starting points I suggest:

From Rationalism to Existentialism by Robert Solomon. Solomon was an incredible philosopher that had a firm grasp of existentialism, and was one of the leading minds for business ethics as well. This book will take you through the conceptual foundations semi-necessary to really wrap your head around existentialist ideas.

Sartre Explained by David Detmer. I've been called a Sartre apologist on a number of occasions because of how frustrated I get that 9/10 people I meet who talk about Sartre haven't read anything beyond Existentialism is a Humanism, which he actually regretted writing because it fails to adequately convey the genius of Being and Nothingness. David Detmer is the 1/10, and very clearly lays out Sartre's philosophy.

Talking with Sartre by John Gerassi. Gerassi was the son of Sartre's best friend, and the only person he authorized to write his biography. You'll learn some fascinating things about his philosophy here, including the fact that **Sartre was a determinist**.

The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus. I see a lot of posts on here that talk about absurdity and meaninglessness. You need to read Camus if you want to get over that.

From my perspective, people who study existentialism will go through phases. First, they'll be confronted by the idea of absurdity and plunge into despair thinking nothing matters. Then one of two things happens: they stay there, or they continue exploring what other philosophers have to say about this and realize this is not the case at all. Existentialism actually frees us from absurdity, conceptually-speaking.

In more extreme terms - it is a vain hope that in the absence of personal action ‘karma’ will wreak vengeance on their behalf.

It goes against realism and a science based understanding of how the world works.

I don’t believe in an ordered, fair and just state of nature or the universe-even if I wasn’t an existential nihilist, absurdist, and philosophical pessimist, I still think I would have trouble with this hopeful fantasy.
It’s akin to believing in superheroes.

Depersonalization-derealization disorder is a highly distressing mental illness. The American Psychiatric Association classifies it as a dissociative disorder, a class of mental health conditions that disrupt memory, awareness, identity or perception. People who have depersonalization-derealization disorder feel disconnected from their mind or body (depersonalization) or their surroundings (derealization). This leads to the people who suffer from it to have chronic anxiety and depression, which inevitably disrupts every aspect of their lives.
Up to 75% of people experience at least one depersonalization/derealization episode in their lives, and approximately 2% meet the full criteria to classify it as a chronic disorder. DP/DR is usually a long-term mental health condition - a lot of people suffering from it can have the condition for many years or even decades without a second of relief.",1

You know, that dizzy feeling, le *Néant*, those quiet moments during late nights, or in the middle of a crowded train, when you are suddenly hyper-aware of the fact that you exist, in a Universe of all things, surrounded by Others, with this thing called a consciousness that literally no one has even the slightest idea of what it actually is or how come we have and how come it allows us to do the things we can do with it, from building pyramids and painting Sixtine Chapels, to writing on a computer about said feats in a random corner of the world, to pondering our selves, to pondering *itself*...

I feel like I broke my humanity, at least in the sens that everyone else experiences it like. I feel every action, every decision, every day that passes, as an arbitrary, futile attempt at distraction. Distraction from this conclusion I've mentally trapped myself into: that there is no meaning. And you know, imagining Sisyphus happy is all great, but what if I don't have a boulder to push ? What happens if rather than suffering through action, I simply feel as though I'm stagnant at the bottom of the hill, watching my body roll the boulder up the hill, every day, but not feeling like that is my actual self, whatever that means.

I recognise that my suffering lies not in my day-to-day life actions, but rather in my pondering of them. I become miserable only when I become conscious of the fact that all these things I do, study and hang out with friends and drink and love, are all distractions, and that no matter what I do, no matter how happy or miserable I feel, year after year, I always end up here, in these sorts of nights, where only I am left, with the same recurring thought: that in the end, it doesn't matter. And I write this last sentence without ascribing it a positive nor negative connotation, but simply as a statement of fact, that leaves me feeling...empty. Again, not in a suffering way, I guess ""Comfortably Numb"" would be an appropriate expression, to the risk of sounding cliché.

I agree with Camus fully, we *should* imagine, Sysyphus happy, it is the only way, to create your own meaning, to enjoy your own life without trying to dig deeper, to find *""chaque éclat minéral de cette montagne pleine de nuit""*,  for it is all you are certain of having. Logically, I am right there with him. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do so emotionally. I always end up feeling this numbness, that genuinely feels like the only authentic aspect of my self. Everything else I try to become, to *be*, feels constructed, fake, an illusion.

  Death should be examined and weighed in our hearts before we get too far into our lives. I firmly believe in keeping a loose focus on it, and in doing I end up fully appreciating every aspect of life. When I'm miserably hot I can find thanks in that I get to appreciate this finite feeling, which in itself makes me appreciate the cold more because of the contrast that gives life to either. It helps to cut through the illusions of our cultural programming and preconceptions on happiness by showing how fleeting, meaningless, and superficial they can be.

  The best way to relieve worry is by examining that which is worrying you. Some people, and I sometimes wish I could have so much faith, turn to religion to fill that existential anxiety we all get. To them, I say good deal. To those in the same boat as myself tho, it can be a bit more difficult to deal with. When I was a bit younger (17-23ish) I went through a fairly thorough existential phase, filled with more angst than I would care to relive.

  In that baptism of anxiety, I knew I had to resolve that dissonance or I would burn out from it. In my unwanted quest, I came to the conclusion that death really didn't matter. It was in living a full and happy life that was truly worth considering. That once it arrived it would be here, and it would be of as little concern to me then, as should be to me in life.

  Smile my friends, because life is a beautiful thing. In so doing you mitigate your own burdens and those around you. And that is truly worthwhile.

1692853026.0,I think that religion is a distraction from death and an excuse to die with fake satisfaction,"Let me begin with some important information.

1) this is my first time on this subreddit.

2) Im 17 years old and NOT a fucking ancient philosopher who somehow digested centuries of research covering belief.

3) I expect to be criticized in both nice and harsh ways. I accept that and even invite that.

4) I'm still working out and discovering my beliefs everyday, which means some of this could be foolish or purely incorrect. If thats so, that doesnt mean i'm retarded, it means I haven't happened upon the information I need to accept the idea was foolish.

Let me explain my current beliefs. I view myself as an existentialist. I don't view myself as this because I think I'm cool or I think it makes me unique. No good has ever come out of trying to have an existential conversation with other dumbass highschoolers in my grade. I view myself as an existentialist because I believe that there is no inherent meaning to life or existence. I do, however, believe that meaning can be somewhat internally and temporarily found through the discovery of passion. I believe that the discovery of this 'passion' is not inherent either.

This universe is extremely confusing, absurd, unfathomable and lacks instruction (a clear objective). I despise the many mysteries and unanswered questions that the universe dangles in front of my face as I beg to fall asleep. I hate that I don't have access to the truth of why everything is the way anything is. Why nothing was apparently something before everything. For some time this made me so angry that I turned to nihilism. I was younger and even MORE uneducated on that matter than I am now, and I just wanted to reject the idea of meaning in the most brutal way I could. I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle it. Yet, eventually my mind found some ease. I realized that these questions are and will forever be unanswered to me - to everyone.

So wait what about the almost revolting title? Im fucking getting to it...

For most of my life, my grandparents on my mothers side were fantastic. They were such lovely people that only cared that I grew up happy. Eventually, both of them got a little too old. They both had heart attacks and multiple strokes, but they survived. It was hard for me and my brother to cope with how sudden this was. At the beginning of summer, my sophomore year I believe, we visited them and had the most wonderful time. By the end of summer, we weren't sure we would ever see them again. We never even got to see them much before, other than occasional talks on the phone, because my mom wasn't exactly terribly close to them.

Holy shit I'm getting there. Bear with me...

Eventually they were back in somewhat okay health. No visits were on the horizon, but they were able to start calling to talk. Immediately, the only thing they would ever do now was preach their lord and savior Jesus Christ. I would tell them about my fantastic day that I had at school and how I had gotten an A on the project I was so stressed about... they would attribute MY success to god and then carry on telling me about how when I die there's gonna be some eternal guy whos like ""Did you see that, I did that shit"" and i'm gonna be like ""Huh, see what? Who are you?""... ""Im God. I just crafted that entire storyline you followed. Your welcome"". Piss off. Please excuse my apparent aggression, this is just me releasing my current contemplation through my fingers and into the keyboard. And yes, I know that's a complete mockery of what different religions believe happens at the end of the line... apologies. The point is that I refuse to attribute anything I do to some God we 'have faith' exists. I create my existence and choices.

My grandparents are afraid. I hate how harsh this sounds when I type it, but this is what I believe. My grandparents brushed death. Life snapped its fingers and both of them realized that in a moment's notice they wouldn't exist anymore. Life will be OVER. Everything they have done is definitive. Everything they do from now on is the final strokes of the pen on the final page of their story. So they panicked. They clung to anything that would disprove that this is the end of the line. They turned to mankind's distraction, religion. Now life isn't over, it's simply reaching its next supposedly eternal chapter. It's a religion that provides a fake sense of internal satisfaction. ""yea, I said those shitty things. I did those shitty things. I hated, and loved at all the wrong times. I allowed myself to succumb to many, many 'sins'. But ya know. Gods got me"". Please, please, please continue to understand that this isn't backed by any Q&A with my grandparents. It's simply my hypothesis. My belief. I don't agree with the way religion allows you to pretend it's all under control. It isn't.

In conclusion here. I invite ridicule or agreement with anything I said. Its like 10pm where I am and I spent the whole school day listening... not to the teachers... to my thoughts. these are those thoughts. I finally deemed it necessary to externalize my thoughts and really gather a public opinion on the matter. Am I insane? Eh... Do I think I'm an ancient philosopher who somehow digested centuries of research covering belief. No, I already fucking said... I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! That's the point. I want to know what im talking about.

1684393846.0,I'm done with philosophy.,"I've been studying philosophy for the last 3 years, I started bc I wanted to live a better life and was really interested in ethics and the meaning of life.

It's been a long journey from Aristoteles to Kant going all the way to Marx and recently ending with Satre, Camus and De Beauvoir.

Learning philosophy has honestly been a really enriching and interesting experience with lots of exciting ""eureka'"" moments but also really stressful and dreading at times.

I'm satisfied with all the things I read and I'm afraid any extra amount of theory will do little difference in my life at this point.

I know I will never stop learning from life, so I will always keep an open mind, but really now I just want to be free and do what makes me happy and help others to be free and do what makes them happy.

I realize this post is kind of dumb but I needed closure.

1624729168.0,My love affair with existentialism. A sort of note to anyone struggling.,"Being grateful to be alive can be a difficult decision to make. The list of obstacles in the way of that particular choice are innumerable. The long nights awake with thoughts spiraling through your mind. The alienation and loneliness that creeps it’s way into your thoughts on a crowded street. The depression and hopelessness that can turn day to night, sinking in to meaninglessness. 

Those depths can feel like all that exists in all of the universe. It’s so hard to see that the deeper you go, the heights you leave behind rise higher and higher. That the depths serve to increase the breadth of existence, and in both directions. 

It is practically impossible to truly choose existence without at some point at least catching a glimpse of The Void that seemingly surrounds it. But that Void is not an endpoint. That Void is nihilism. Existentialism begins when you choose to see the void for what it is, accept it and turn away. That moment is when you say “Yes!” to life. And at that moment you are free. 

At that moment there is no cage that can hold your heart. No mythology that can trap your mind. No meaninglessness that can take away *your value*.

As you come back from the depths you will find that the brights are brighter, the love is deeper, the sadness is sweeter, and the darkness has a beauty you had lacked the eyes to see.",1

1604746149.0,A drunk man’s interpretation of reality as he sees best to describe it.,"
Reality itself is an illusion. A fractal replication of itself that continues on and on and on. If you’ve ever experienced a lucid dream, that’s real. In that reality, that’s real to you right? That’s why it’s called a lucid dream, because you are still you and you feel like you can control this alternate universe of a dream, and you *are* operating that simulated version of that reality within yourself. When you wake up, you are exiting that simulation and entering this one, which is the base reality. 
Whenever we have a “great” moment in this reality, just any moment you had that felt so surreal and perfect that it was almost too good to be true, the reason it sometimes doesn’t even feel real is because you’ve entered into the lucid dreamed reality of another you, and that’s why it feels so perfect to the point that you feel like you’re playing a script. Because you *have* experienced it before. When you finally get to kiss that person you’ve wanted to kiss for ages, when you finally get that car you’ve been waiting for, whatever it is, whatever significant moment you experience is also a dreamed reality of another you in another reality. It’s like a filter though, it’s not like stepping through one reality into another, it’s more like you’re still on the course of the base reality while the lucid dream kicks on over it as a tv program to you. as you control it. So it’s more like a video game tbh.

Dreams and memories are more synonymous than most would tend to believe. 
But just because you remember a lucid dream’s reality doesn’t mean that that’s the reality you’re currently in. You could have visions of a certain reality, say for instance getting together with your best friend- but those visions may only exist as a view into other realities while in your reality that relationship may not be compatible. And that’s why heartbreak happens, because one soul envisions a reality that the other soul does not. 

We are our souls. Who we are, our brains, whatever strange unknown energy is powering the blobs of jelly in our skulls is us. Our personality. How we see and experience and evaluate the world. Our bodies aren’t us. Our minds are. The thing that is consciousness itself is what we also call a soul. And this whole other plane, if you would imagine reality as a tesseract, we are on the inner cube, currently, our reality, what we’re all experiencing is the inner cube while the outer cube of the tesseract of reality very much exists alongside us. And that’s where we “go” when our body just rots away until the soul detaches. It is my belief that when our body begins decaying, our minds don’t decay alongside it. The physical form does; the blob of jelly rots away too, but the energy, the force that flows through the blob of jelly allowing consciousness to exist doesn’t. It ascends and enters the 4th dimension, a plane that does and always has existed since the big bang. 
Everyone thinks of this stuff in religious terms or supernatural terms, but I think it’s neither. It’s cosmic. It’s all cosmic. 
The concept of the soul was formed alongside the big bang, alongside the concept of space and time and reality itself.",1

1641043452.0,Disturbing truth about our existence,"Here is the truth

Earth is hell or a prison planet, when we die our souls are tricked into going towards the white light tunnel (located in the moon), our souls are zapped and our memories are erased, then waking up as a newborn baby. Karma is a scam, this world is wired to make us accumulate bad karma, and chain us to karmic debt cycle. All those abuse, misery, accidents, illness, crimes, war aren't for our life lessons. It's for energy harvest. How can we learn from mistakes if our memories are wiped out?

Reincarnation is a trap to keep our souls in this prison planet, these evil entities do not want us to escape because we are food to them. These tricksters want to keep humanity at a low vibration frequency. The archons/aliens/evil entities feed on our suffering, for example our negative emotions: anxiety, guilt, fear, anger, sadness, jealousy, lust. These evil aliens gain power from low vibration frequencies.

You have no way of thinking for yourself, or are capable of causing any influence in the matter. You just experience that single moment of physical pain, and what your current state of mind (whether it being mental anguish or regret) for what we'll perceive as an eternity. At least, this'll give people an excuse not to commit suicide with regret, and find a way to die a happy death, since technically, you wouldn't be getting the release that those who committed suicide would desire.",1
1701231758.0,There's actually a lot evidence for a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives,"This post relates to existentialism because ideas of a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives are often used to counter the idea the world is essentially absurd or meaningless apart from the meaning we arbitrarily ascribe to it. 

I think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit there is conflicting evidence as to the nature of a higher power and an afterlife, if such things exist. I also think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit that anything that can be attributed to the existence of an afterlife or a god has alternative explanations. 

All that said, many, many, many people throughout history testify to having convincing personal experiences of interacting with a higher power or having access to knowledge of an afterlife. 

Furthermore, it is in fact logical to conclude humans are incapable of fully comprehending most of our reality, so just the fact that it is thus far impossible to model or conceive of a scientifically supportable way for consciousness to persist beyond death does not mean consciousness does not persist beyond death. A caterpillar has no way of knowing it will become a butterfly, but it does all the same. A dog has no way of knowing it was the product of selective breeding from wolves, etc. etc.

Just as a pet hamster can never understand the myriad forces that lead it from a pet shop to a child's bedroom, perhaps we similarly cannot comprehend the god or gods involved in our lives.

It is, in fact, a faith-based proposition to assume humans are capable of creating a model that completely explains reality. If humans are like every other species we observe, then we must have limits we cannot surpass, no matter what, and we must be subject to forces, very probably including higher intelligences, that we can never understand. 

So, we KNOW we can't understand everything that affects us. And we KNOW that, if we are like every other observable life form, we are being influenced by HIGHER INTELLIGENCES. If there really is no higher intelligence beyond human intelligence in the universe, than humans are so exceptional that there probably IS a some sort of god responsible.

Combine the near certainty that we are influenced by higher intelligences with the extensive, albeit conflicting, reports of interactions with what appear to be higher powers, and the existence of AT LEAST one such being seems incredibly likely, if, of course, not at all certain.

If you want to take comfort in a godless and absurd universe and the end of consciousness after death, do so. But, similarly, if you want to take comfort in the idea of a greater purpose and an afterlife and a god or gods, do so as well because, MOST LIKELY (although it's impossible to say what the exact odds are) there IS something like a god and there IS something like an afterlife out there (the existence of the god-like being is more likely than the existence of an afterlife).

This does not mean you should abandon reason or critical thinking. Seeing reality for what it is doesn't mean making shit up to fill in what you don't know. For example, a preponderance of evidence indicates atheists can live long and happy lives, and there is certainly nob particularly convincing evidence they inevitably experience eternal punishment in the afterlife (if there is such a thing) either. 

Whatever you do, be open to the truth of reality and do not let your own assumptions override this truth. Try to recognize what you do not or cannot know with certainty, if at all.

Also, if you haven't actually had one of these seeming encounters with a higher power, don't be too quick to dismiss the experiences of those who have. I think a key aspect of these encounters are how convincing they are. It's possible to have the convincing experience without being sure of what you experienced. But if you've never found any ""encounter"" to be convincing, I would argue you've never actually had an encounter, not that you're just smarter or more of a critical thinker than the people who have.

The real test for the skeptic is being confronted with something that is TRULY convincing and still retaining their pre-existing views, which is definitely possible.

I constantly think about why anything exists at all and my current position is that it’s a result of a higher power we can’t comprehend that has nothing to do with any earth founded religion or theory, at the end of the day something can’t come from nothing.

I was always at peace with the idea that while there is higher power in my mind, I never thought that humanity bore any significance to said power due to the scale of the universe, we are merely a side effect of this creation, but I scared myself earlier.

The fact that we have predetermined rules; speed of light, gravity/mass, fissionable material - always seemed to me like numbers that were just programmed in, we could all live in a box that some god submits at a science fair and gets a C grade, we could be imperfect, disposable, someone hovering over the delete button every day and we don’t even know it.

1701915442.0,Free Will,"Can someone explain to me why they think there is free will? I barely see anything logical about it.

Let's start off by examining how free will would work. In my opinion, free will would operate in a world where the future is completely unknown, which our future isn't, due to the butterfly effect. We all know that we can calculate and predict things, and the precision is determined by the amount of information we have. Imagine there is a hypothetical being that freezes time and possesses all of the information in the universe – and by all of it, I mean completely all of it. The being can calculate everything and anything into the future, leaving our future at a 100% chance of happening in a certain way. It's important because if there is only one outcome possible for the whole universe, then an individual doesn't have free will.

I believe our world is made up of massive interconnected energy/ies. I got this from Tesla's numbers theory and the apple in the sealed box theory. What's in the box will go through every single possible way the energy there can change places and transform, etc. Basically, that is our universe in a big never-ending box with energy interchanging possibly forever. Essentially, the energy is like numbers – 1+1=2 – and you get something different from adding one thing. Our universe can expand and interchange from how many 1s there are before going back to the starting state, as in the apple in the box theory. That only can't happen if there is an infinite amount of energy, for it would be changing forever forward.

We're basically the same as everything but also different. Like us, the tiny portion of our universe doesn't have free will like we think. It's just a construct; it isn't really real. Instead, there is a process of thought that happens from the will of the interconnected energy. It is funny how one piece of the universe can look at another and think it's, for example, dumb.

The only way I see there being free will is if somebody is controlling our bodies without us or our bodies knowing it. But it doesn't make sense because then it would still mean that, in this world, there is no free will, and our minds operate in this world.

I can't think of one logical way for there to be free will that doesn't require a massive leap of faith. Can anyone inspire me?",1
1694576611.0,No fucking chance would infinite monkeys with infinite time and typewriters eventually type Shakespeare.,"They're never going to accidentally hallucinate 1600s English language and grammar and turns of phrase, as well as the associated socio-political milieu required to produce that language AND then randomly maintain Shakespeare's personal writing style for numerous acts and plays, all in a row? Without knowing what any of it meant because they're just mashing at the keyboards?

The only monkey ever who could come close was Shakespeare himself. So no monkeys in infinity ever, just one very advanced monkey outlier you can almost not call a monkey.

So ok ONE monkey stumbled on writing Shakespeare after millennia, when all typewriter monkeys collectively evolved into humans who abandoned the gift of infinite typewriters and chose instead to write with a fucking quill by hand the thing that supposedly, a monkey on a literal typewriter could literally randomly do according to the Monkey Theorem.

So not totally zero. One weirdo outlier in a universe of normals. So long as we we agree that “infinity monkeys” also means “whatever weird creatures monkeys develop into.” 

This hypothetical typewriter monkey without a typewriter outlier is so special, it should not be reduced to what monkeys can do. Shakespeare was unique and rare and odd and smart and sexy and fun and inappropriate. Flaunting the rules of society because he knew that they were only there to disguise the typical truth. Saying whatever he fucking wanted and fucking whoever he wanted because he was so much more than even infinite monkeys could smash out after being chained to a typewriter for the full infinity years. Even then, they wouldn't come up with what a human decided to change and do.

So. Now that we are unburdened by the conviction that we are unspecial monkeys (we are actually special monkeys and the typewriters are the psychological burden of of comparing ourselves to monkeys), what all do we want to do better and different and more enjoyably and inappropriately than everybody else? 

&#x200B;

We are only free as individuals if we maximize our unique human capacity to self-upgrade our monkey programming. Social, psychological, biological. We can decide to make Humans different. We are most human, least like monkeys, if we try a new weird thing that our instincts drive us to and/or based on our weird and unique brains, and modify our environments and genetics in less than one lifetime, and then tell people about it. 

The meanings of life are to Evolve and Protect the Hive. To step away from the typewriter and say FUCK THIS and go create a trajectory for yourself and your neighbors that improves on the pre-evolved way of doing things. Humans are programmed to do this, some more than others. Only when monetized is our creativity bad for our neighbors. We deserve to own our evolutions! We should not let companies pay us to create new and better versions of the world so they can sell it for too much.

We can hyperevolve as individuals and efficiently communicate with our neighbors about an option for them to improve their survival and the survival of their neighbors. 

We can all just go out, be whatever is right for us, learn about it and change it and test it out for survival, and get right back to you on if it improves our lives.  Other animals are to dumb to do this. Except maybe ants.

We're not a monkey hallucination. We're more like demigods who are only held back by our lack of ant-like community support.

1688561578.0,Why wouldn't you want God to exist? Why is the Abyss better than God?,"I understand if you simply aren't convinced enough to believe it is true but surely you would rather it be true than not?

If God does not exist, there is no reason why you are here. You are just an accidental byproduct of nature. A result of time and chance.

Your sense of self is just an illusion created by chemicals in your brain. The mind is reducible to the brain. You are an animated bag of molecules. A hunk of spoiling flesh on disintegrating bones. There is nothing more to you than that. Even this propensity for inventing meaning and purpose is just a evolutionary mechanism for survival. But any meaning or purpose is an illusion. There is none.

On scientific naturalism, we know that the ultimate fate of the universe and everything in it is to die in the heat death of the universe.

Right now you are simply on an earlier point in a timeline that inevitably leads to oblivion. And you can’t change the outcome or break the chain of causality. You are essentially a biological puppet in a universe of impersonal and indifferent forces far beyond your understanding. After all, why should evolution even select for our minds to know truth? The blind non guided evolution of our minds is shaped toward our survival, not to knowing truth.

Man thought that in killing God, he would finally be free. But all he has done is traded in one slavery for another.

Before killing God, he was a slave to a personal creator. After he kills God, he is still a slave except to impersonal and indifferent forces that govern every aspect of his being and his existence down to the molecular and atomic level.

The question is which slavery would you prefer?

The non existence of God is not freeing, it is paralyzing. It is to be a cast away with no direction better than the other precisely because there is no ultimate End or Purpose. No path is more valid than the other, all are equally valid or equally worthless. There is no rhyme or reason to any of them except that which you invent as a delusion.

If God exists then there is a reason why you are here. You must have some part to play in the story He has authored, no matter how small. Human beings were made to be in communion with the infinite, boundless, unsearchable and fathomless almighty God such that even after billions of years you would not even begin to grasp Him or get bored of Him. There is also a reason for evil and suffering. There is redemption from it. The atheistic solution to suffering is just to shrug one’s shoulders and say, “that’s the way it is and there’s no greater meaning or reason for it all. It’s just bad luck, a shitty roll of the dice.”

If there is no God then the best you can hope for is an easy and comfortable death to escape the meaningless suffering of existence - as pleasant an end as can be to the pointless and suffering infused venture called life. It seems to me that the only thing which can overcome the despair of the Abyss is its equal and opposite, i.e, the existence of boundless, fathomless and almighty God, Perfection Personified. Why wouldn't you want Perfection to exist? 

I think this quote from self proclaimed atheist Bertrand Russell sums up the utter nihilism and despair that man must face if God does not exist:

>That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the débris of a universe in ruins—all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul’s habitation henceforth be safely built. ​

In the words of Alan watts.

“Speculative philosophy, as we know it in the West, is almost entirely a symptom of the divided mind, of man trying to stand outside himself and his experience in order to verbalize and define it. It is a vicious circle, like everything else which the divided mind attempts.
On the other hand, the realization that the mind is actually undivided must have a corresponding and equally far-reaching influence on thought and action. As the philosopher tries to stand outside himself and his thought, so, as we have seen, the ordinary man tries to stand outside himself and his emotions and sensations, his feelings and desires. The result is a fantastic confusion and misdirection of conduct which discovery of the mind’s unity must bring to an end.
So long as the mind is split, life is perpetual conflict, tension, frustration, and disillusion. Suffering is piled on suffering, fear on fear, and boredom on boredom. The more the fly struggles to get out of the honey, the faster he is stuck. Under the pressure of so much strain and futility, it is no wonder at all that men seek release in violence and sensationalism, and in the reckless exploitation of[…]”

Your tiny head peeking through your eyes at what is a wonderful miracle of life (my interpretation ) and crying like a baby that it’s not gonna matter. I ask you when bro , when isn’t it gonna matter.

Sure you might conjure up some thoughts like , my family my school my finances my dreams and my goals , well no shit bro they’re not gonna matter because 🥁they don’t exist.

They are your thoughts, your insecurities, your mind trying to grasp to a certainty in a chaotic universe (again a personal  interpretation  ).

You cannot lose what you do not have.

When sitting on a sofa in the centre of four walls where no animal can just walk up and chew your sorry ass, maybe be a little grateful for the iPad or iPhone you’re typing on and sending it out to the world to read.

See the ro you drink your water from the air conditioner or a heater. 
The food the drinks the sex the alcohol the puff of a vape the smile of little kids playing the melody of a song like tingini.

Lay back make some plans maybe jog in the evening today tell you dad and mom you love them you just forget to tell them 

Don’t be hard on yourself. You are human and you are meant to chase excellence to move forward and forget about the things that you already have like a dog chasing it’s own tail never reaching anywhere but the present and at the same time neglecting the present moment and having no gratitude for it.

1626036044.0,"Not sure if unpopular opinion, but...","Pacifism, veganism, environmentalism, organised religions, any so called positive movements, is an excuse for the existence of the human animal species.

An evolutionary self—defence mechanism against suicide or regression. Sentience, then sapience, then self—awareness had to be insured by nature from collapsing.

Which also means that fantasising the collapse is a way to vent the truth that mustn't be fully conscious, the truth that we're all — how should I put it...

Nature is governed by a system which is from a moral perspective parasitic — the species have to take and enslave, have to devour, feed on other species... the nature eats itself. This is all well and good, until consciousness arrives and develops sense of time and a whole rainbow of emotions including empathy, this causes millions of written pages later on defined as existentialist thought, sometimes literal sometimes imbued into epics and poems.

All boils down to this — man has to take life, but now man does not want to take life, and man can't take his own life. So what does man do?

Man hides from reality in a simulation of reality, where it makes sense to man, which is perfect or so it seems. This way man does insure himself from spreading the contagion, which is either collective suicide or regression into primitive animal state.

Thus we come full circle, which is:

Man has to be mad, he has to pave his road to hell with good intentions and way to heaven with bad intentions, not consious of the maze or the strings, of the puppet master behind the curtains, which is nature.

Modern man has to be mad. Until man is no more, and something else will come along. I don't know how, but it will be a being that will be both self—conscious and wholly in reality.

This is not what we want to hear, but if consciousness comes from a single source, then this kind of insurance is not completely unfair, yet it is far from sentimental.",1

This article is intended for philosophical discussion only and does not suggest that one cannot enjoy life or should cease living; if you are experiencing psychological distress, please seek professional help before delving into these profound topics.

## The Proof:

1. **Foundation in Determinism and Physicalism:** As established, all phenomena, including human consciousness and decision-making, are governed by deterministic physical laws. This framework negates the existence of free will and independent agency.
2. **The Illusion of the Self:** The 'self' is an emergent property of complex neurological processes, not an independent entity. This understanding implies that the beliefs, desires, and motivations we attribute to our 'selves' are also products of deterministic processes.
3. **Absurdity of Self-Created Meaning:** Since the self is not an independent entity, and our thoughts and desires are products of deterministic processes, the concept of creating one's own meaning is inherently flawed. The idea of ""creating meaning"" presumes an agency and self that are illusory.
4. **Meaning as a Human Construct:** Any meaning that individuals believe they are creating is itself a result of deterministic processes. It is not an authentic expression of free will or personal agency, but rather a byproduct of the same deterministic laws governing all other phenomena.
5. **Circularity and Lack of Foundation:** The act of creating meaning is based on the premise of having a self capable of independent thought and decision-making. Since this premise is invalid (as per the deterministic and physicalist view), the act of creating meaning becomes a circular and baseless endeavor.
6. **Inherent Meaninglessness Remains Unresolved:** Consequently, attempting to create one's own meaning does not address the fundamental issue of life's inherent meaninglessness. It is merely a distraction or a coping mechanism, not a logical or effective solution to the existential dilemma.

**Conclusion:**

* **Futility of Creating Meaning:** In a deterministic and physicalist framework, where the self is an illusion and free will does not exist, the endeavor to create one's own meaning is both absurd and meaningless. It does not provide a genuine escape from the inherent meaninglessness of life, but rather represents an illogical and futile attempt to impose order on an indifferent universe.
* **The Paradox of Perceived Control:** While we are essentially prisoners in the deterministic game of life, our inability to perceive ourselves purely as biological machines compels us to live as if we possess independent agency. This paradoxical situation allows us to continue our lives under the illusion of control. However, the awareness that this control is indeed an illusion shatters the enchantment of our existence. This realization makes it challenging to overcome the sense of life's meaninglessness. In this context, there is no ultimate solution or definitive goal. Distinctions between choices like not to continue life, indulging in hedonism, adopting stoicism, or embracing any other worldview become inconsequential.

Ultimately, in a deterministic universe where free will is an illusion, nothing holds intrinsic significance or value. This perspective leads to the conclusion that all choices are equally meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

Everything you can think of, and everything you can’t think of will be real. It’s not a 0.00000000000001% chance. It’s statistically, completely inevitable.

Even the laws of physics can’t stop it. In another universe down the line, physics will be unrecognizable.

Heaven? It’s gonna be real. You will get to enjoy a paradise within paradises. You’ll be a guardian Angel defending it from horrid creatures starved of existence. 

You will be a god, forging existence to your liking.

You’ll be in hell, suffering for terrible crimes you’ve committed. You’ll be a harrowing freak of nature robbed of your title as “human”.

You will be everything at fucking once. The infinite and endless pain, pleasure, rage, sadness, bliss, fear, everything the universe has come to be.

All of this and more is waiting for you. And when it happens, it’ll happen again and again. You can’t stop it.

1656600780.0,"Dear All the People Who Never Got the Chance to be Al*ve,","Dear all the people who never lived,

I was almost one of you. My mother considered aborting me, but didn't. To put it mildly, my life has not the best, although that definition might depend on your personal definition of objective sucess. My measure is a complete happiness, and although there has been great moments, I am not sure if I have totally acheived that, ever. But despite that, I'm still glad that I exist, which on the face of it seems to be at odds with my pro-choice beliefs.

You might be wondering why I feel this way when I am   happy I am not amongst you, the unborn civilization of people who were not birthed. This is why I think how I do...

Up to 90% of fertilised eggs do not implant. One in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, and most have been prevented by contraception. The timing of sex, and the events surrounding it and leading up to it all play a role in what particular sperm will be fertilised, what individual will be given a chance to grow from that sperm and egg. Added to that, the less kids somebody has, the less possibility they will breed a whole tree of future ancestors. This could potentially prevent thousands of lives from having ever existed. In modern Western society, most lives that had the potential to start, have been blocked from starting. Some from abortion, yes, but most from miscarriage or contraception. 

But it's true that the concept of not existing is uneasy for most humans, including me. In my opinion, we have created hundreds of religions to reassure people that they won't tracelessly disappear back into the oblivion of emptiness that they briefly emerged from. Other mammals, invetebrates and insects don't create religions both because they haven't got the mental capacity to do so, and because the concept of 'non-existance' isn't something they have ever struggled with. Just like embryos. If I had been aborted, I would not have known,  to get to this stage where I am capable of thinking about it. 

The contents of a scrotum have no cognitive awareness. IVF embryos on a petri dish do not yet seem like they should have human rights. They have the potential to develop into something more thats true. But they are not human yet. Sperms, ovums, zygots, embryos, or fetuses are not babies. I think this begins at around 9 weeks in of pregnancy. This is just my opinion. When the brain develops, an individual conciousnesz starts to develop, and it starts to mean something more. The whole of an embryos existance is based on random chance. How many billions of sperm does a fertile man produce in his lifetime? How many do not become the individual they were capable of being? A shuffling in bed over someone's arse could be likened to a genocide, if life really did begin at that stage. I don't think it does. But this is just my personal opinion. 


So, to the *me* who potentially might have never existed, and to all the others out there who do not, I still maintain my view that every child should be born to a mother that wants and loves them. Millions of lives that have had the potential to live, have not been lived. The ones that are should be wanted, loved, and born into a stable situation. Being forced upon someone who doesn't really want you is going to cause all sorts of problems. Not existing, not ever having existed, is not a problem for anybody who cannot yet think about it. 

Human mothers raise their kids for a long time. If someone isn't responsible enough to use contraception they probably aren't responsible enough for parenthood as this is a long obligation that requires many sacrifices. Forcing women to do this against their will won't result in a great outcome for either them or their kids in most circumstances. 

Billions of people who could have been born, won't have been born by the time we get to the end of human civilation. The people we invite to join our society should be wanted and cherished. I'm sorry that you were not given the chance to join them. But you will never have the chance to feel bad, because you never really existed.

As a single mid-twentys guy, this scenario is familiar. But while the context is admittedly specific, the core question, I think, applies to anyone who has to decide if they want to find meaning in the lot they  have, or whether they believe they can be free to achieve their potential, if only they had the courage to do so.

So, lets say I'm in a pub and see an extraordinarily attractive girl chatting to her mates in the smoking garden. 30 minutes later I find myself at the bar standing beside her. Neither of us are with friends and there is some time before the barman will reach us. Assuming my facticity isn't an issue here (i.e. say I'm good enough looking to be a *plausible* sexual partner for her) I have two options: Say 'hi' or don't.

Existentialism, as I understand it, tells me to do two different things.

The first is to follow Sartre and break out of the bad faith in which I find myself: A million reasons fly through your head telling you not to talk to this girl. Each reflecting a different side of the existential angst and fear of stepping boldly into the world and consciously deciding to talk to this girl. 

But Sartre tells me my excuses are self-deceit. By convincing myself not to talk to her, I have denied my freedom and hidden myself in the folds of the excuse of 'next time'. So I should embrace the beautiful message of ultimate freedom that Sartre suggests, and talk to her.

On the other hand Viktor Frankl, the Auschwitz survivor and psychologist who wrote a short but beautiful ""Mans Search for Meaning"" argues that we have the inner freedom to decide for ourselves how to understand any situation. Say I don't say hi and go to bed alone that night. I wake up the next morning, feeling tired, hungover and horny, but it is within my power to my perspective that morning and re-frame the experience of the night before anyway I want. If Frankl can find meaning in walking through a frozen Polish field to a day of slave labour, I can surely find meaning in a mild hangover. And I can find meaning in the moment at the bar where I decide not to seize my opportunity and resign myself to the fact that I'll never be with that beautiful woman. 

I can choose to understand my life as one in which I don't talk to girls at bars and I can focus my energies following Frankl's wise philosophy of reinterpreting any situation according to how I find most meaning in it. On the other hand, I could follow Sartre's advice and push myself to achieve all my potential promises. I can talk to the girl and regardless of outcome, I know I've expressed my radical freedom as a conscious human being.     
    
The tension between these two becomes even worses when facticity isn't so clear cut, as the girl-at-the-bar situation would be. What if I'm not sure if I'm attractive enough to get with this girl? I can decide I'm not, risking being in bad faith, or I can decide I am, but stay with Frankl's philosphy, because I'm more interested in finding meaning in my life as it stands, rather than changing it.

When you see a squirrel get hit by a car you see the organic machine of its body end. Its brain fails to function and it can no longer think and perceive. by all we think we know, its life could have been experienced, but by who? Now that the squirrel's dead, to our knowledge, its life-experiencing abilities have ended but the world keeps turning and people are still living. It always has been and always will.

My theory is that all of the infinite lives are experienced by the universe. Once you die, you wake as the newborn animal/human of the next life without remembering anything, because your brain is new, but the thing is it isn't ""you"" who are experiencing these lives. The lives are just being experienced and that's part of the universe's existence. I'm just the universe's current stop on the infinite train of lives being experienced. Once I'm done, the next one will come and, without ""knowing"" anything, that live will make its course, most likely fearing death through lack of knowledge or existential contemplation.

Even though that's just a theory, let's all try to make our chapter in the never-ending universal consciousness experience a good one; live long and well.",1

1601008816.0,All Power Corrupts: Is This True?," ""*Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.*""

\--John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton (1834–1902)

This quotation from the 19th Century British historian and moralist, John Acton, has been one that has interested and followed me all of my life. As a young adult, I felt that it was too cynical, and it did not allow for the goodness that is in people. One reason for my rejection of the quote may have been that I never realized that the words ""tends to"" were part of the quotation, and so I had assumed that it was an absolute statement (as expressed in the title of this article).

However, as I have grown older and observed, not only others, but also myself, I have come to see that the saying, even in its more extreme form (i.e. ""All power corrupts"") is fairly accurate, and it is consistent with the doctrine of the ""fallen nature of man"". We human beings have a tendency to mess everything up without desperate prayer and humble dependence on God.

The most common way that this happens (in my experience) is that when we do something good, we receive recognition for it, which translate as ""authority""... authority, based on experience. The more good that we do, the more authority/power that we receive. And that ""authority"" can easily be taken as license to ignore our own faults and focus on the faults of others. People will allow us to do that if we have been fair in our dealings up to that point. And the more fair we have been, the more authority/recognition/freedom/power we will have received and thus be capable of abusing.

If there is any part of the quotation at the start of this article which I would object to, it would be the last part, the part that is usually left out: ""Great men are almost always bad men."" It would be better to say that we are all ""bad men"" (whether generally regarded as ""great"" or not). For some of us, that badness comes out very quickly; others see it; and then they cease to give us the recognition that they go on to give to those who are more successful in taming their corruption. So in many ways, the ""great"" leaders are those who have been able to overcome this ""fallen nature of man"" for a little longer than the rest of us. It is just that when they do fall (if they are going to) they will have more opportunity to do harm because of the increased power that they have received.

We need leaders, at the same time that we see [leadership abused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sodR7476NV4) every day. But if we see this as a problem that all of us (whether leaders or followers) are struggling with, then there may be more hope for us all.

Religion has often been accused of preying on the guilt's of others in order to maintain control over the masses. There is some truth in this, but there is a dilemma as well, in that true spiritual leadership does need to confront those guilt's and it needs to fairly represent God's position. Both the love of God and the justice of God need to be communicated to the world. But they need to be communicated in ways that are not biased toward the ""voice in the wilderness"" that a true spiritual leader needs to be. As John the Baptist (the original ""voice in the wilderness"") once said, ""He (Jesus) must increase, and I must decrease.""

The prosperity preachers and other Calvinistic ministries have achieved a lot of success and popularity for themselves by telling people what they wanted to hear about the ""love"" of God, i.e. that God wants only to make them healthy, wealthy, and popular. This, to me, is a corruption of the truth. But by the same token, the hellfire and brimstone ministries appeal to people's desire to be righteously superior to others whether or not we really ARE superior in God's eyes. Condemnation, whether it be of the congregation or of the clergy, represents, to me, yet another form of corruption.

So, whether we are taking a soft line (""God loves you."") or a hard line (""God is not happy with what you are doing."") and whether we are talking down to the masses from the pulpit of leadership, or responding to leadership from the congregation, we are going to encounter opportunities to corrupt the power that we have. Flattery and condemnation both are abuses of power. If we ignore this, as so many of us do, then we do so to our own spiritual detriment.

Having recognized that we all have power, and that we are all prone to abusing this power, the big question is how do we reverse this tendency? I think it can only be reversed through prayer. By that, I mean that in the secret place, between ourselves and our own conscience, we need to resolve to confront abuse in our own lives whenever we see it, with God's help. If we can see that yesterday's success at confronting our own corruption only increases our freedom to be more corrupt today, that may be of some help too.

Ever vigilant.  Ever faithful. It is a never-ending battle, and it is one that can only be fought in the secrecy of our prayer closet, where we ignore everyone else's faults except our own.",1

It’s literally impossible for you to not exist after existing. Knowing that Einstein was right, knowing that we’re atoms essentially at our core (which is still energy) the question isn’t whether we go on or not, but what do we go into becoming? Just an idea to play around with. I do not speak in absolute on subjects no human being can give a confident answer to. You can confidently believe whatever you want . Whether there is an afterlife or not the living will never know, but we will all die, and when do we ALL will find out whether what we believed on earth was true or not. The unfortunate part is we have to die in order to find out.


Edit: I think laws of physics have been proven by those UAP’s to have laws we have yet to discover.

I mean, of course you gotta eat, sleep, shit and work (for money).

But beyond that, why do anything else?

We all know how comfortable it is to do the same thing over and over again. Beyond a point where your routine has embedded in your muscle and you don’t even know if you’re awake or dreaming the entire day.

And the only reason you survive is out of your instincts and old habits. And let’s face it, it’s because they’re beyond your control. Else you would’ve screwed them up too.

Huh, Isn’t that nice? Living like a walking corpse.

Well, not everybody is lucky to be like that. So… Congrats you.

I mean, look at others. Having a dream? Wanting to win something? Trying to make a difference? Caring for someone? Fighting for a cause? pfft… idiots.

> Why keep fighting? Do they believe they’re fighting “for” something? For more than their survival? Can they tell me what it is? Do they even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. Although... only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.

These delusional people, they don’t know the truth. Even if you tell them, they can’t and won’t accept it. They’ll only try to inject false beliefs in you. But you already know that, don’t you? You live among these brainy apes with a pseudo-meaning to life. What a waste.

*Rolls eyes*

You’d much rather prefer living with this perpetual existential crisis. Huh? Right?

Because you just can’t find your ambitions. The very idea of goals doesn’t make sense anymore.

You are lost in the sea of purposelessness, just sailing by the wind. You don’t know where it leads. You don’t think it matters.

You exist only because you don’t have a reason to cease existing.

Face it, you got nothing. You don’t have the answers.

Because regardless of what answers you dig up, you know it’s not what you want because you don’t know what you want.

An answer? For fucks sake, you don’t even have a goddamn question.

You are stuck with this idea of pointlessness, to a point where you believe even that very idea is pointless. Nobody could win an argument against it. It’s like a self-fulfilling-prophecy. And you’re stuck in it.

So you sit down.

You stop trying.

You only do what the situation demands of you.

You stay idle. Because being stagnant is warm & comfy.

You don’t want to get out of your bed every morning. You work only because you need to. You don’t wanna check out that new restaurant your friend has been calling you to. You don’t wanna go to the beach with your brother. You don’t wanna drink with your pals. And definitely you don’t wanna hit on that pretty girl you like. Because you don’t even want to like her in the first place.

You don’t feel responsible for anybody. And you don’t feel anybody is responsible for you. You neither enjoy the day, not regret it. It juuu…ssst goes on.

And then you go back to sleep hoping you’d feel different the next day.

But you don’t. You never do.

Eventually, you lose hope. Not that you had much.

You stop caring about family, friends, you stop caring about the world, you stop care about food, sleep, happiness, your own needs and You stop caring about yourself.

You become a zombie.

You only live because you don’t have what it takes to do it.
*(Also honestly, most times you don’t have a strong reason to)*

Sometimes you look at those “normal people” and wonder if there’s a chance for you to live that life. Because as much as you pity them, you also envy them.

Because like it or not, these self-fooling idiots, are happy. Not always, but they enjoy the taste of life. All the sweet, bitter and salty parts of it.

I had to say, I really wanted a simple life, once. I had high hopes for it. It was the time when I started being aware and started asking questions. I really had a chance. But the existence works in mysterious ways and the results won’t always be as you expect it. And sometimes there would be nothing in your power to change it. So she went out of my life, taking with her my last chance in being normal. I gave up. That’s an old story now.

Now I want you to listen carefully. This is a one-way path and once you’ve made the jump, there’s no going back. You can’t unsee certain things.

> Nothing will change anything

You can desperately search for things to hold on to. You can try to manipulate your thoughts, may be even learn to forget it. You might even get some help. But the truth is, **YOU CANNOT RUN FROM YOURSELF** (can’t stress it more). This part of you will always stay with you and question you.

You cannot change you are, or, who you’ve become.

It’s better if you start embracing it and make peace with it.

Good luck.

1482708821.0,An essay inspired by the metaphysics of the Trumpite candidacy,"“…the society with which he deals has an unstructured brutality and a violence never far from release…”–John Russell

Sadism is the operative force driving both the Cruz and Trump phenomena. It is a sadism born of an atmosphere of generalized nihilism and anomie in an America increasingly characterized by a deep sense of confusion, disorientation, and dislocation regarding the nature and even existence of society’s shared values and goals. Said confusion is perceived as extending to and/or emanating from the authority of a government that either cannot defend essential forms of social, economic, biological, and spiritual existence, or that in fact has, at least partially, midwifed the very destruction of these vital forms and thus provoked the anomie that now marks their decline/haunts their disappearance.

As Dostoevsky has demonstrated nihilism in its most extreme forms readily leads to sadism or self-murder. Since the latter is the most absolute and redundant form of political self-extinction, only sadism remains in the existential arsenal of the subject so afflicted. Despairing of a neoliberally captured government’s ability to achieve even a modest rebalancing of politico-economic power in their, i.e. national labor’s, favor (or even more myopically “philosophically” incredulous as to its ability tout court and/or doubtful of the very justice of the notion), they instead predictably precipitate into neurotic (thus of course unconscious), unprogrammatic (distracted/impeded as they are from any authentically alleviative economic project), and ultimately hysteric (“nothing short of Trump shooting my daughter in the street and my grandchildren [would stop her from supporting him]”) forms of political and existential fervor. Thus awakening among a subspecies of the servitors of the powerful an opportunistic and, of course, exploitative desire to capture them anew in the net of an individually psycho-economically redemptive and/or religiously prophetic and hermetic übermenschlich figure: a literal ‘demagogos’-cum-’eupompos’ or fortunate guide to the insecure masses, from whom, as explains psychologist Benjamin Wolman, the “powerless individual strives to attain [psychologically educative and emulative] power by introjecting the powerful figures or a part of them or being incorporated by them.”

Regarding the term Übermensch, scholars affirm: “Nietzsche derives [said] term…from Lucian of Samosata’s hyperanthropos.” Lucian’s satire Kataplous e turannos, ‘The Descent or The Tyrant,’ “offers the account of the tyrant as “overman,” that is: as a superior man of wealth and power who in this worldly life towers above others regarded in this same life as inferior or “lesser” [i.e. literally and figuratively “lower”] human beings…Lucian’s parody transposes the same putatively “higher” man, the hyperanthropos, escorted by Hermes and ferried by Charon or Death into the afterlife of the Greek underworld.”

Another terminologically and conceptually elucidative classical example is the Sophoclean tragedy ‘Oedipus Tyrannus,’ which begins not altogether unpromisingly–(“You set my beloved land on a fair straight course when it was storm-tossed in troubles, and now may you be its fortunate guide [eupompos]”)–. However, as is famously known, fate and (political) hubris had other designs, namely, tyranny, madness, and tragedy (hubris, as an authority described, is that “arrogant disregard for laws and other moral constraints,” which is both seed and fruit of the “excessive acts committed by the powerful against the less powerful,” and which in turn “breeds the tyrant” [hubris phuteuei turannon]). Of course it is precisely Trump, among the Republican candidates, who most self-consciously presents himself as an ‘eupompos’ (i.e. as a literally most “fortunate” self-avowed “guide” to individual secular self-redemption), but who by hubristically promising to supersede the laws of national constitution, in the name of mass popular will and personal power, reveals himself an ultimately unapologetic ‘demagogos,’ itself the traditional ‘anteactus’ of the ‘tyrannus.’

Clearly then a form of neurotic-reactive magical thinking (though one no longer entirely captive to neoliberal false consciousness) is motivating a significant number within the so-called neoliberal “precariat” to not simply stand openly manifest of (heretofore repressed) tendencies regarding their long-fantasized sado-nihilistic views on the purposes of the instrumentalization of U.S. state (super) power, but to, in fact, develop a new, transformative and englobing orientation or Weltanschauung that universally (and not just politically) obsessively seeks what it perceives to be guiding magnifications or modelic concentrations (i.e. “emanative” reservoirs) of psychological power and impregnability (with outward and reflective manifestations of impressive and imposing material attainment)–and it is in this alternatingly shallow and profound (but never undynamic) sense that the psychological übermenschlich type of political leader serves a positive function to those he inherently attracts.
However, in pragmatic political, legislative (and even avowedly extra-judicial) terms, for the aforesaid reasons of plutocratic constitutional foreclosure, not even the leader’s übermenschlich “personological” capacities (“He shall be greatest who…is overrich in will. Precisely this shall be called greatness: being capable of being as manifold as whole, as ample as full”–Nietzsche), however, can be expected to translate into more than an essentially negative governing principle (i.e. determinatively, programmatically denegative, denialist, nihilist). For this is precisely where the nihilist-derived ubermenschlich fantasy accedes and surrenders to the banality of neoliberal denialism–the snake’s rebellious tail is rewound back into the ouroboric hold of its possessor’s befanged trap-like mouth. : i.e. a governmental repercussive effect of necessarily even greater negative potentiality: more aggressive, incarcerative, punitive, reactive, relegative, obstructive, secretive, suppressive, violative, and violent*–in short one that is ultimately even more foreclosive to popular positive politico-egalitarian change. And all under the color of retro-political revanchism, regression, discrimination, intimidation, and suppression.

**(And with more than a scattered dose of the antinomian in the case of Trump: e.g. the military is “not gonna refuse [my illegal orders]…Believe me”).

Hence the subconscious source of both the “Cruzian”/”Trumpite” animation and vehemence for the rescission of the protections or even the outright attack of those seen as more vulnerable than they. Recourse to conceptualizations of parasitism come easily/are readily at hand (the cruelties, injustices, and stigmata of history ironically and inversely proffer it to them), previous and ongoing vulnerabilities become suggestive ellipses and directional shorthands (formulae) for future “historical” sadistic punishment. The implicit targets of today were the explicit ones of yesterday: African Americans; other historically defeated/super-exploited ethnicities; undocumented immigrants (for the same); homosexuals (the very ahistoricity of their granted protections mark them as specious, unmerited mercies, and therefore “naturally,” inclinatively revocable); those with even light and superficial criminal records (pariahic by definition); geopolitically obstreperous foreign individuals, groupings, and nations “selectively” and contradictorily (i.e. hypocritically) designated “pariah states” by the United States (and thus made so through the circuitous ‘totalitarian logic’ whereby naming–by the powerful–is perilously, potentially existentially, experienced as being by the less powerful [”the Jew is an ‘undesirable’, therefore he is…to be extirminated”; “the Mexican is a ‘rapist’, therefore he is…”]). Such a psychology, in short, evinces a generalized and expansive manic and sadic subconscious pre- or proto-fascist Weltanschauung which I think the following quotes do much to elucidate:

“[I]f the body social remains unconscious of [the need of suffering] or imagines that the need can be ridiculed…the mind proceeds to invent in the guise of acts of cruelty the sufferings it has forbidden the heart to undergo…their fancies lose all vital touch and all capacity for being in sympathy.” (Denis de Rougemont, ‘Love in the Western World’)

*”[I]f life and created nature are but dark wickedness and cruelty, it becomes necessary to obtain release from them by exceeding this cruelty and wickedness. And there is but the alternative to be cruel either to ourselves or to others.” (idem)

“’What! An ambitious sovereign shall be able to destroy as he likes and without scruple the foes that hamper the execution of his schemes for achieving greatness! Cruel, arbitrary and imperious laws shall likewise murder in every century millions of human beings! And yet weak and unfortunate private persons such as ourselves shall not be allowed to sacrifice a single being to our revenge or to our caprice? Could anything be more barbarous or more ridiculously queer? And should we not, under cover of the most profound mystery, avenge ourselves abundantly for this absurdity?’–D.A.F. de Sade, ‘La Philosophie du boudoir’ (as quoted by de Rougemont in idem)
‘Donald, “I’ve learned from my experiences. As a safety factor, I very often see other people as a revolver that could be pointed at me. They are the gun. I, however, am the trigger…We never know what will trigger another person’s killer instinct. It can be something that happened when they were five years old. So avoid being the trigger, and the revolver will not be a threat.”’–Trump: How to Get Rich

Feeling the psychic armor of asympathy and general psychological inurement (i.e. indifference) reflected back onto their persons by the profoundly exemplary and educative discourses of sadism embodied respectively by a bombastic and anti-apologetic Trump, and by the hermetic captiousness of Cruz, their ‘awakened’ (read: disturbed) supporters are, in the aggregate, asserting to the wider world their own psycho-specific–and this is of course the very point–yet imperiously aggressive and expansive Weltanschauung: in essence, a recurrence of the same dark neurotic fantasies that alimented the fascism of the early twentieth century, and which now manifests one of its principal ‘movemental’ epicenters in the United States (itself doubtless an effect not unrelated to over a decade of essentially uninterrupted blatantly aggressive foreign wars, and ones stereotyped by a ‘foreign’ sectarian-ness to boot).",1

I mean just think about how truly fucking mindbending it is to think of the earth, assuming it and humans and society still exist, a thousand years from now. I would argue that there is no crazier of a thought one can have. Think of if you got a glimpse into that era. Think of if JESUS got a glimpse into todays era. Or Muhammad or Buddha. Would they be mind blown? Absolutely so. So with this, our purpose is to further our understanding of this all in every single avenue (doctors, coders, aerospace engineers, psychologists, artists, etc) so that we may perhaps find out some day. It’s easy to say that we never will right now, but as much as history repeats itself, it has been a linear advance of progress in knowledge in the long run. 

This is what I believe. I do believe in God and I will sometimes pray to him or thank him (calling him “him” out of cultural convention), but I just don’t know and I think he understands that. I think he wants me to understand it all better. That’s all",1

1658252794.0,What is beyond the veil or what our world really is.,"I believe our planet, solar system and galaxy exist five billion years from when we think it does. 

Our sun has already turned into a red giant and the Andromeda galaxy has already merged with our own. A small blue star from the Andromeda galaxy and our red sun make up a binary star system. The small blue star is syphoning hydrogen from our sun and will go supernova soon, perhaps in less than ten years from now, or maybe a bit longer. 

We do not live on Earth, Earth is scorched and uninhabitable and we actually live on Mars which is habitable because of our red sun it lies in the ‘goldilocks zone’ We are the Mars colonies who bough life and ourselves from Earth to Mars and terraformed it. The Aliens from the Andromeda galaxy keep the facade or illusion we are all trapped in. There is also life native to Venus, Titan, Europa and others made possible by the increased heat to the outer and inner solar system from our red giant sun, Sol. 

Those loyal to the invaders (the 1% of the 1%) have been promised to be saved on their ‘spaceship’ which is probably advanced beyond my comprehension to a paradise planet that exists in the Crux solar system where they will build a new star for it, it doesn’t actually orbit any star, it is a rogue planet that will be made into a paradise. The star will be built by adding several rogue brown dwarfs together. Those left behind on Mars/‘Earth’ will of course perish. 

Long ago on Mars there were ‘dust devils’ or mini whirlwinds. Some of these dust devils were complex and long lived enough to actually become a kind of electromagnetic life form. The spirits of these long dead lifeforms are the only thing that can save us. They now appear or take on the form of various animal spirits.

Yet I do not exist in other countries so my existence is essential to what I see and perceive. If I do not sense and perceive and feel things that mean I do not exist.

Nihilism is more nuanced than what has made it popular, and it has a crafty knack for being what is, rather than what's known. It's interesting, and insidious. I've had a particular time attempting to free myself of its wit, but a worthwhile time perceiving its truth.

There's a careful counterplay between nihilism and existentialism, and even a romance between the two. Existentialism speaks to the minds self as if received by God, even if His presence may be tenuous in these modern paradigms.

Aesthetics dress the entire drama in a way that can be marveled at, either in pleasure or terror. The design of what is, and the lustful consumption of sensation, unifies an I to a you, so that the isolation of one can feel joined as two.

And amongst all this drivel, remains my faith. It reverberates through my awareness, to the farthest tips of touch, beckoning me to connect with this God! To bow for a majesty not my own, and be raptured to the highest point of communion, ah! beyond intellect and emotion, to the brilliant purity of spirit.

This would fit well with free will scepticism - we are aware of the physical effects of agency, but we are not the source of that agency. We are just noticing it happening through us. Like a car that's aware of itself being manipulated and driven around, but doesn't know where the decision-making is happening.

1693431293.0,Why Why?,"\*Quick update on the people thumbs downing this.  I love when people can't argue the logic, they just ""don't like it"" so they dislike the comment.  Such a strange way to exist only believing what you'd like.

&#x200B;

Words are used to denote a concept or idea with a sound so we can translate that concept or idea to another person.

Many people seem to lose this principle when they start reflecting deeply.

WHY?  What is the definition of this and WHY is it the question asked so often.

""why?"" in regards to the universe really has no more validity than asking the color or flavor of the universe.

If I ask why something happened, the ultimate answer will bring us to the ""first cause"", the big bang or beginning of the multiverse or whatever.

I've found that most people using this question mean one of two things or a combination:

What was the intention?  or What was the initial cause?

To ask the intention is to already assume a god-like theory as non-conscious objects have no intention.  So without God, intention is a meaningless question.

As to the first cause, this becomes fairly ambiguous.

First of all God cannot be proved to be the first cause simply because of the rule, ""everything needs a first cause"".  For example, If there is not God, how did the universe start.

This is paradoxical and a self-defeating argument.  If the rule is everything needs a cause, then God needs a cause and could not be the first thing.  If God doesn't need a beginning, then why did you say everything needed a beginning and thus we don't need to tag on this God-theory because now the universe CAN have started itself or lasted forever.

The words ""Why"" and ""God"" are meaningless as everyone has their own idea of what that word means.  And as I said to being with,

words are sounds to communicate particular ideas.  If that sound no longer functions as a communication of a an agreed upon idea, the word is now just a sound with no meaning.

&#x200B;

Why is this?  Just cause.

&#x200B;

\*Fun addition:

The universe has no meaning and no purpose if God does not exist and therefore these questions also do not need to be asked.

What is meaning/purpose?  They are similar to intention, but more than that, in order to ask the question of the meaning of the universe, one first has to assume the universe is NOT real.

Why did I say that?

What is meaning?  Well we often talk about meaning of something like a book, play, work of art, movie, or some off handed remark that ""meant"" something other than the literal words used.

This means that the direct literally reality of the thing to which we want to apply meaning, is only a representation of the ""true thing""

What did ""2001 Space Odyssey"" mean?  Well it was about a plot of humans traversing space, but the author meant it as a comment of the transcendence of the species, as an example.

So, what does our universe mean?

Well, nothing.  It is real.  It is the literal objective reality.  There is no plot behind it.

So non-religious philosophy has little reason to ask:

the meaning, the purpose, or the ""why"" of the universe as these questions have no ""meaning"" to begin with that is applicable to the situation of reality.

Your mother gave birth to a piece of hardware-your body and brain.

You have been scraping yourself together from a lifetime of experiences.

Of places, ideas, people.

Their essence is you.

They, or things like them will still be there after your body has died.

Ready to be concentrated in a new form.

Though not everyone ends up being 'you', if you look closely, you'll find there are already a fair number of people who think just like you. Who's mind and sense of themselves is near identical to you.

It's quite uncanny to meet these people.

You know everything they have done, and can anticipate everything they are about to tell you.

Because they are, or are nearly-you.

'you' have always existed and will always exist.

So don't worry!

Your sense of yourself is already different to who you were yesterday.

The current version of you passing on has never disturbed you before.

So why should the eventual death of your body be a concern?

You (both your current sense of you, and all previous and future yous) will have found a home in countless other bodies by then.

1) You should make your life as interesting as possible-you'll be back later anyway.

A few months ago I asked here for some help and received some advices. I was like, ""Ok, in fact, living life as good as I can is the only thing I can do and that's it"".  
But I can't still stop wondering on why people are so skeptical on the afterlife?  
I am currently 20, but when I was around 16-17 I did some research around the topic.  
I still remember some stuff from back then, maybe I should take a closer and better look again.  
But from what I read back then, I remained with those ""facts"" :  


\-There are many cases of Near Death Experiences in which people are declaring to have similar experiences that follow a similar pattern. The cases are well documented and sustained by various doctors and experts in the field. All these happen when the brain, from a medical point of view is ""dead"" or, maybe a more proper word for it, ""completely turned off"", not releasing or receiving any type of signals that a functioning brain would.  
\-Despite the fact that certain medications or diseases can alter someone's personality, there are theories that propose the brain to be more of a machine that receives consciousness and allows us to interact with this world, but with limitations. As such, brain does not create consciousness.  
\-It is supposed that nothing is lost into the universe, nothing truly disappears but only transforms. Now, it can't be certain what our consciousness will transform into, but it won't simply disappear (not instantly at least).  
\-Afterlife is highly referred into the history of the human kind. There is no reason, from an evolutionary point, for us, humans, get this idea from nowhere and hold onto it for so long. There might be something unexplainable about the ancient civilizations that the human kind has lost touch with. Also, despite the, let's say, absurd Egyptian rules and concepts about the afterlife, Bible, which still holds strong today, says things that can be correlated to modern scientific facts about how the world works, things that were discovered hundreds of years later. My guess would be that the entities that wrote the Bible were truly inspired by a higher cosmic being, but they being still humans, didn't reflect perfectly on those or simply translations were screwed over the time.  
\-Many ""miracles"" or ""paranormal activities"" people claim to have experienced have been debunked as fake, but I think there might be a seed of truth beneath all of that.   


I know that I mostly failed to make some proper arguments here, and I agree that especially the last two points I made are not points at all, but as a conclusion, there are still many unexplainable things about the world, of what the soul is and about the existence of everything. But, the concept of afterlife somehow made it's way into this world and affects directly or indirectly our everyday life. As long as an afterlife is not totally disproven, nor totally proven, there is a a wire of it which we can't yet trace with our actual knowledge, and probably never will. But what I can hope for is that once I die, my ""soul""(consciousness) won't perish. Maybe, even achieve an infinitely superior level of existence along with others.",1

A signal makes them run from a predator, or e.g photons enter their eyes, and notify the brain of  the presence of food, causing them to then head towards the food, and so on. They are basically relatively complex systems that respond to stimuli in certain ways. In the future, we could manufacture an ai that functions in the same way, but it wouldn’t have a consciousness. The AIs of today even have the capability to learn.
Let’s take this one step further. Consider a mouse. It is tremendously more complex than the insect, can respond to more external stimuli, can perform more complex actions etc. But just additional complexity shouldn’t create a “consciousness” if the insect doesn’t have it. Let’s go further, for example a monkey. The monkey is a very complex rendition of the insect, it can do a lot more, respond to a lot more and so on, but again, that wouldn’t create consciousness. Let’s now take this to a human. It’s the same deal. Why would the human be conscious, rather than an incredibly developed, complex automaton, like the insect, but has all the additional complexity of creativity, ingenuity, compassion etc. So one of the following things must be true:
 1. Solipsism is real
2. There is some sort of undiscovered “consciousness threshold, everything below it not having consciousness, and everything above it having it.
3. There is a supernatural factor at hand that we cannot prove",1

**Argument**

Everything needs needs a start and things can't start from nothing.  Nothing is eternal because it needs to start.  Thus the universe didn't start from nothing and can't be eternal, so some type of ""God"" is responsible.

**People need to stop using this argument**

All this does is replace this seeming paradox with the exact same paradox.  Ok now you have a God.  Remember when you had such a problem with everything needing a start and nothing is eternal?

So you fix the problem by adding an eternal (something with no start) solution  to your problem you had with things being eternal and having no start.  ERROR....

1689792023.0,infinity became conscious and we are a result of the consciousness.,"Ive come to realize what infinity actually is and how we got here and figuring out how our life gets meaning from it all.

We are starting to learn about infinite dimensions and infinite time in physics/quantum physics.  Imagine a quantum ball of light with all possibilities bundled into it.  This bundle became conscious in some kind of rare configuration because compared to infinity, even the remote possibility of existing must exist somewhere in some dimension somewhere in infinite time.  just like we know the universe is at least as conscious as we are since we are made up of the atoms from it.

Death is an illusion.  think of going under anesthesia, or a coma and waking up like no time has passed at all.   well if the atoms your made of can reconfigure themselves again in the same configuration as they are in your body right now at a later point in infinite time with infinite dimensions, then you will live again at some point (if you only believe your consciousness is from electrical impulses.)

knowledge of good and evil.  Even an atheist can tell if something is good or evil.  harming others, raping, ect EVIL.  maybe the knowledge of that is a trait of being conscious.  So the infinite consciousness must also possess that capability.  If we are all extensions of that consciousness, maybe we judge ourselves at death to determine where our consciousness wants to be.  if we believe we are evil, then the infinite consciousness could reject that evil consciousness in order to know itself and its good traits better.    Maybe all ideas of the afterlife are true because again any world that can exist must exist.  and maybe your consciousness gravitates to where your heart is.  maybe jesus discovered a hack for evil people.  perhaps faith 100 percent knowing and believing of a heavenly dimension brings your consciousness to that world.  Maybe your faith is in reincarnation and that brings you to that world.  maybe faith itself is the hack to bypass you judging yourself at death.

The infinite consciousness must also have MEMORY as that is a trait of our consciousness.  Memory of all conscious extensions that it created or is part of it.  regardless of time.  Maybe this is why many religions speak about god ""remembering"" them.  What if that memory is more like a computer backup that remembers what it deems fit of its own consciousness and tires to delete the part it doesn't like.  better watch out if your the part it doesn't like.    the delete button might be pressed on your consciousness.

&#x200B;

We are now developing Artificial intelligence thats expected to grow to be all knowing.  Maybe its our duty to input the parameters of this dimension such as the discovery for the speed of light, mass, gravity ect that we have discovered and create a consciousness that can imagine all possibilities within the limits of this dimensional plane.  when that gets switched on it will almost become extra terrestrial in nature coming up with possibilities of how gravity and time are tied together.  especially when that Ai is based on a quantum computer

I had to post this somewhere because the internet needs this idea to be inputted into it for future ai to read.

1687568164.0,All Philosophy is Meaningless,"I've just started reading Friedrich Nietzsche's ""Beyond Good and Evil"" and I have to admit his ""prejudice on philosophers"" chapter is brutal but also really interesting. It was really wordy and hard to read so ill summarise it and keep it brief:

- Consciousness isn't the opposite of instinct and innatism; in reality, conscious thinking tends to be informed precisely by instinct.

- He expresses that a philosophers likeness to proclaim ""universalised"" ideas and disinterestedness aka Dogmatic Philosophy (to express a belief as an undeniable truth) actually only informs us of the philosopher, not the Philosophy (we're given more insight to their character than anything else).

- All Philosophy ""creates"" is its own version and perspective of the world. ""It cannot do otherwise."" Nietzsche makes several comments on its subjectivity and possible unintentional ""tyrannical drive"" of one's self. 

- The man fucking hated Soticism. He found it absurd for Stoics to say 'act according to nature' as if we had to recreate ourselves in the image of nature - irrational and so on. Even though that's not exactly Stoicism, Neitzsche tells us Stoics rather want us to recreate nature in the way Stoics desire (which is also absurd).

- The guy also takes a jab at Kant, calling his categorical imperative ""hocus pocus"" and says Kant uses circular reasoning to say we have an ability to acquire ""synthetic apriori judgements"" and that nevertheless we need to believe we have that ability (or faculty) even though we don't have it. This is what Nietzsche commonly refers to as a ""false judgement.""

Following his reasoning here, the absence of objectivity Philosophy holds compells Existentialists and nihilists like me to think it shouldn't necessarily be seen as a philosophy, but rather just a family of views or a realisation. Therefore, we don't (or shouldn't) label ourselves as ""nihilists"" or ""existentialists"" in the same way a believer of Plato would call themselves a Platonist; we would just be, idk, a person, our name, or just a bag of chemicals floating and wandering in a seemingly infinite material universe.",1

1695337496.0,We as humans are nothing but organic creations driven by emotions," 

As the title says: we as humans are nothing but organic creations on this earth but emotions and intelligence (which varies) is what makes us feel differrent.

These emotions wrote our history and it's what makes us integrate/adapt & procreate.

You don't know yourself and you never will because your thoughts aren't even yours they are influenced by the people/media that you follow & what makes you follow is the thrive to feel included.

God never existed as we perceive HIM but He exists as a primal drive/feeling in us that works entangled with intelligence & that's why people that keep arguing over religion with science are just simple apes, because religion goes hand in hand with science, regardless of what you may think of me as reading this post keep in mind that God (as in emotion) drove the ancient engineers to create many things that drove to this point.

Heaven & Hell exist here and they are an result of our actions, emotions, intelligence and mindset but unfortunately we don't choose the circumnstaces we're born in

The people that wrote the books consisting of the bible were frighteningly intellignet humans for that time because they were mostly right.

To explain more simply how we as humans are inherently wrong of what we believe in take these following examples:

1)Imagine you are an cruise captain travelling the ocean & you encounter an whirlpool (water vortex) the sight of this monstrosity gives you an feeling of hell. but if you fall into it nothing will happen but sink into the water, something wthat would have also happened if you're ship suffered an malfunction.

2) Same thing goes for encountering an black hole in space, your mind upon experiencing this will go into shock but as soon as you get sucked into it you will fall at peace with the forecomings.

So struggling with feelings of worthlessnes/depression over materialistic & dumb modern things such as never having a girlfriend or not having the latest phone/shoes car or whatever is pointless nad pathetic but regardless of of being aware of this it will hardly go way since the emotion of being equal/powerful will hardly go away.

Imagine you were born blind, all your life would be different and you never would be aware of all this inevitable drive as long you will have what truly matter for you: Family.

You are nothing but the universe experiencing itself.

THe act of having a family gives you fulffillment and you do it to finally be happy and at peace, but you never know the path your offspring will take.

We are afraid of death but it's something very natural and for many to be embraced rather than feared

1695316117.0,We really don't know anything about anything,"We don't even know if we even really exist in any meaningful way. Let me give you a simple analogy real quick. Let's say I'm Jack, an english speaker and I want to do business with a Japanese man who only speaks japanese. Jill my assistant speaks englsih and spanish. The japanese man's assistant speeks japanese and french. So we need a translator that speaks spanish and french. Every letter, every contract, correspondence, whatever, would have to go through those three individuals before reaching either me or the Japanese man. But here's the thing, the entire time I'm doing business with the japanese man Jill is the only person I ever come in direct contact with. How do I know the Japanese man or the other two individuals even exist? Jill could be forging every document for all I know. This is what the experience of reality is like. The japanese man represents the world outside my body. His assistant is my body. The translator is my brain. Jill is my minds eye, she creates the illusion of reality that I see around me. And I'm the inner eye that sees the illusion created by Jill.

According to Jill everything I see is true, everything I see is real. But I don't  know, how can I know? All I know is what Jill tells me. I see a lot of you people on this sub struggling with thoughts of solipsism. That's nothing compared to the actual reality of our situation. What you really should be struggling with is whether or not you exist at all. I really don't think I do exist. Sounds insane, I know. How can I make a claim if I don't exist? 

The way I see it I don't dictate my thoughts. My thoughts simply occur. Like everything else I observe my entire identity as a person, my thoughts, beliefs, actions is all just information that Jill feeds to me. I feel like everything is just theater. It's like Jill is the movie itself and jack is the protagonist of the movie. And jack has become aware of the fact that he is nothing more than a fictional character created by the movie. Before gaining awareness jack use to identify himself as the person sitting in the seat in the theater in front of the screen watching the movie. And whatever was happening on screen was what was happening in the real world. But now jack realizes that the theater is actually empty. And the only thing that exists is the movie. Which from my perspective is a very funny realization. Because I was born in the theater. Not literally obviously. A scene from 1989 ""Batman"" was my very first memory. So in a way it's like I came into existence in the movie theater. And the movie theater has dominated a large part of my life. So it's funny to come to this realization concerning my existence. 

But let's assume Jill is telling us the truth about everything. Because Jill has never really given me a reason to believe she's a liar. So why should I assume that she's a liar? I shouldn't. So the real world exists, I do have a physical body, a brain. And my consciousness exists trapped inside Jill. Well guess what? I still don't exist. Cause I am not my consciousness. My consciousness is something I observe outside of me. If it's outside of me it isn't me. I know it's a weird claim to make because it's my consciousness that's making these claims. It's like my consciousness is identifying as something that it isn't, which is the thing that observes consciousness. But it all plays back into my movie analogy where jack thinks he's in the theater but realizes he's actually a part of the movie.

Even if I were to assume that I am my consciousness I still don't exist. Would you argue that spiderman exists, or batman? They exist as fictional characters, but not real life people. Even if my consciousness existed in the real world I would still be just as fictional as spiderman or batman. Because not even consciousness dictates itself, I don't control what I think ever, or my choices. Its all just a long deterministic chain of causation. My entire identity is nothing more than a reflex of the original cause of reality. 

You might argue against everything being deterministic. You'd be arguing against a brick wall. I've seen glimpses of my own future. And despite not wanting what I saw to come true it did anyway. So I know for a fact it's deterministic. 

Maybe I don't exist but everything else exists right? I do have a physical body and the world outside it is infact real...right? Not really. It's all just fundamental forces compressing spacetime into virtual particles. Those virtual particles yield atoms. It's all just waves in a ocean of pixelated nothingness. Coupled with the fact that reality is deterministic you could argue that reality is indistinguishable from a potentially eternally long movie printed on the film of spacetime. 

Naturally the only thing that can be real is what is fundamental. Everything else is just fiction created by the fundamental. Jill is real and we're all just fictional characters in the mind of God. So solipsism is true, just not for you or me. It's only true for God. It's all whatever though, it doesn't really bother me anymore. It would just be nice if this movie got a happy ending already and transitioned into a neverending sitcom.

Edit: I just realized that achieving a happy ending would actually require me to move the plot of the story...one day. Hopefully Jill has written in some character motivation not to far from now.",1

The **first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state**. The second (in the video The Skeptical Conclusion of Classical Physics - ""Boltzmann's Brain"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXwHD3rdnpI) is that “a universe, that is fully random (or at thermal equilibrium), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-entropy) state, and it follows (see below) it is more likely for a single brain to spontaneously and briefly form in a void (complete with a memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for the whole universe (and other brains)  to have come about as the result of a random fluctuation in a universe in thermal equilibrium” -  which could be regarded as the physics of **solipsism!** (It is more likely making these brief solipsistic brains occur than a whole universe. i.e. more likely in tossing a coin to get H,T,TTT,H,H... than H,T,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,H,T...). 

“In 1931, astronomer Arthur Eddington pointed out that, because a large fluctuation is exponentially less probable than a small fluctuation, observers in Boltzmann universes will be vastly outnumbered by observers in smaller fluctuations. Physicist Richard Feynman published a similar counterargument within his widely read 1964 Feynman Lectures on Physics. **By 2004, physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal ""Boltzmann brains"" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe.”**

I can't help think that would *resemble* Leibniz's Monads- in which each monad is enclosed within itself with a 'copy' of the universe, and no contact with others is possible – or Graham Harman's 'Objects' which withdraw from everything, having no direct contact with other objects.

1. about one in seven boys in the US school system is on medication for chronic (meaning longer-term or ongoing) behavior problems, and
2. boys in the US are primarily the ones carrying out the school shootings we hear about. 

Is there an existential problem here? (I think it could be interpreted a thousand ways, and will be. but) I do think there is an existential / existentialist philosophical perpsective on this.

Imagine you were born blind, all your life would be different and you never would be aware of all this inevitable drive as long you will have what truly matter for you: Family.

You are nothing but the universe experiencing itself.

THe act of having a family gives you fulffillment and you do it to finally be happy and at peace, but you never know the path your offspring will take.

We are afraid of death but it's something very natural and for many to be embraced rather than feared

So that leaves you where?

Knowledge of the truth is depressing because only you seems to see it at all. Everyone is blind to it. So you feel lonely in the Knowledge. 

You know the funny thing about stories, if you keep going they all ends in death. But they write ""they lived happily ever after"" 

It seems only a few that aren't fooled by fairytales. 

Seeing the truth is not a curse. Make it your strength. Pity the fools just don't show them. 

Or you will be slapped on a lable and be either heavily medicated or in a prison of some sort. Some prisons don't have walls. You know what those prison are.

Use it to your advantage. When you have nothing to loose they have nothing to hold you back with. Nothing to leverage with. 

You have all the power. 
Take em fools for a ride. And I'll see you at home when you had your fun in this world. How ever long that it may take.

Remember this ""My anger, commitment, and determination, regardless weather acceptable by to a society's standards I do not adhere to, will NOT get to dictate how I live MT LIFE. More they try to suppress me more angry and determinated to break free I become.""

Blind believe in the blind faith. Fuck that. Believe in yourself and your own truth. 

Anger mastered and forged is sharper than a scalpel, louder than words and more powerful than the earth itself. It's the power of ANGER and DETERMINATION focused on to a sharp point UNFATHOMABLE. 

Never loose forcus. Open your eyes and see. Look around you. Can you see. 

Whole world is a fucking joke.

But the key is whatever you choose to believe must be unfalsifiable (this part is important).  This way regardless of whether your belief is true or not the material reality will appear the same.  This way you don't need to worry about proving it or not because you've designed the thing you believe in to be undetectable anyway.  Like values - whether or not your value system is objective or subjective, or right or wrong wouldn't make a difference as values are invisible and undetectable anyway so regardless of their truth the world would look the same.  So value whatever you want and believe whatever you want as long as your beliefs are unfalsifiable (just pretend they are true).

This sounds absurd and ridiculous but it's no more absurd and ridiculous than the world we live in.  To live in harmony with an absurd world you need to be believe in absurd things.

These people and the marks they leave in the sand were the only things that mattered. Marks left from the dragging of their feet, due to the weariness of their hearts. From their attempts to persevere, blissfully ignorant that they have gone adrift from what matters in the end: moments. 

For life is a collection of moments, allowing us the chance to create meaning and purpose. Blessing us with the opportunity to be intentional with our steps in the sand, bravely planting each foot towards the horizon. Finally accepting what has always been known: the shore is warm, familiar, safe, yet otiose. Overcrowded by those not courageous enough to sail through unforgiving waters.

The existentialism, nihilism and absurdism developed prior to the rise of Fascism of the 1920s-30s.  And its affect on existentialists was to give them not a subjective meaning, but an objective opposition to Fascism, at the risk to their own lives. A cause, a purpose. 

Thus by 1947 Sartre had a universal cause for humanity, as did Camus, though in his case not via organised politics. But the 'make your own meaning' mantra had to be dumped because that could include being a happy fascist. So Existentialism collapsed into Marxism, and Maoism, which in turn has collapsed.  

We once again came to live in a bourgeoisie capitalist consumerist society, computer games, sessions at the gym, recreational dr_ugs and boredom. Ideal grounds for nihilism and existentialism, once again.

And once again a reality of Ukraine and the intentions of Putin. OK to ignore? So sure McDonald Douglas are making a fortune.

So we shouldn't give weapons to Ukraine, just chill? And those neutral countries, Finland, and Sweden? From no support to joining NATO to 70% +.

1652094007.0,Speculation on the rottenness of man and what kinds of people may overcome it.,"(M17)

Humans are all rotten. Every person I know, is rotten. I am rotten. I do stupid shit all the time. All I want is to be pure. I want to be the purest I can be. I want to be free from the seven sins. I want to be free from my habit of judging people. I want to get over a rough and dirty past of mine. I want to be a human worth living as. I want to die knowing i beat the devils and demons in me tempting me to commit sins and do harm. I long for that death. 

But all humans are rotten. I know this. I am rotten too somehow. But that's me abiding to the rules I have created. 

*Everyone being rotten.*

Maybe we aren't all rotten. Maybe we can change. Maybe we can become pure. Atleast we can probably become pure enough, if not completely pure. But that sounds super cheesy. That some people are pure while the rest are rotten. 

Indulging in rotten desires, wanting to be superior, bringing others down, controlling behaviours, mass corporate greed, racism, deep rooted sexism, neglect, toxicity and so much more. 

I change all the time. Sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. Looking for a variant of myself I enjoy being. Learning from my mistakes and ""evolving"" you could say. But people don't change. I can't believe people even exist. People seem like robots to me. I can't believe this life is real. How do I even know a car is real? I have never drove one. It just moves on it's own whenever I sit in one.

*What if the earth spins and the car just stands still causing us to move forward?*

Jokes aside. What is real. Do people even exist? Sometimes I think most people are robots with the rare occasion of meeting another ""player"" like myself. Navigating this world through all these neverchanging robots/zombies. 

That would explain why I can feel like it is possible to become pure while I still find *everyone* rotten to the core without the possibility of changing. Because we are fundementaly different. ""Players"" and ""Robots"". Players navigating this world why the robots simply live and dont change whatsoever. Unable to become pure unless they started out that way. Meanwhile players navigate the axis that is life and death. Being able to become what they want to be. 

I just realised. I am rotten. Because I feel like everyone is rotten. Instead of accepting peoples imperfections i label them ""rotten"". I am rotten for wanting to spend time with other ""players"" who is just another word for ""perfect being"" which does not exist. I am rotten. Maybe even more rotten than all the people I thought of as rotten. 

Is it ok? That I find people rotten if I find myself rotten too? Do I have to be what I don't want to be? If I want to be pure do I have to call others pure too? I hate people and the fact that I can't differentiate myself from them hurts me. If I am pure they are pure. If they are rotten I am rotten. I hate people. I hate people for what they've done. But I do the same things they do. Which means that I am one of them. 

*I hate myself.*

Because I am what I hate. A rotten person. A pure person. Depending on what one would want to call themselfs. I am what everyone else is. And I hate everyone. Which means that I have no choice but to hate myself. Unless I can change. Is change possible? If it is then I might not have to hate myself. But that's a question for another day.

• The transition in optics from geometrical optics to physical optics.

• The transition in mechanics from Aristotelian mechanics to classical mechanics.

• The acceptance of the theory of biogenesis, that all life comes from life, as opposed to the theory of spontaneous generation, which began in the 17th century and was not complete until the 19th century with Pasteur.

• The acceptance of the work of Andreas Vesalius,whose work De humani corporis fabrica corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by Galen.

• The transition between the Maxwellian Electromagnetic worldview and the Einsteinian Relativistic worldview.

• The transition between the worldview of Newtonian physics and the Einsteinian Relativistic worldview.

• The development of quantum mechanics, which replaced classical mechanics at microscopic scales.

• The acceptance of plate tectonics as the explanation for large-scale geologic changes.

• The development of absolute dating.

• The acceptance of Lavoisier's theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of phlogiston theory, known as the Chemical Revolution.

• The acceptance of Mendelian inheritance, as opposed to pangenesis in the early 20th century

you say science is a process

Now we have two choices

1) is science at an end-no more to learn no new theories

Or

2) is science still evolving

Most would say science is still evolving

Thus

we will have a 2200 century theory B evolving-by a process - out of 2100 century theory A

that means in terms of new theory B theory A is not true

thus

2100 century theory A is a myth

The answer is yes. 

Doesn't the hard determinist think that once your initial choice is made, the outcome of that choice is determined? How then can this outcome change? Yet given this knowledge, and you freely decide to change, your chances of winning the car increases.

I believe in the Christian God, a lot of the reasoning coming from Timothy Keller’s Questioning Christianity podcast series (would recommend). He mentions this in the series, but it’s less of a solace and more of a qualm for me; I believe in the Christian God, but rationally I can’t say with 100% certainty that He is the Almighty. 

I’m 22 and, obviously/hopefully, have a lot of time left to live, but it still feels like time is slipping away at an alarmingly fast rate. I find that I have these existential dreads twice a year, sometimes they last a few months. Christmas has become a typical time for this to happen. It’s the usual, “oh it’s been a year ALREADY”. I understand that being scared of death is wasting the time I’m so afraid of losing, but often I can’t help it. 

Two main questions from this post I’d like to hear answers on…
1. If you are adamant that your view is correct (any worldview encouraged), how do you grapple with the fact that rationally you can’t be?
2. How have you/have you come to terms with the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of an afterlife? In a more mentally sound state, I would say that death is unavoidable and the afterlife is what it is and there’s nothing you can do so don’t stress but right now that is stress 😂

I’m hoping I come more to terms with it the older I get. It’s no secret society likes to pretend death doesn’t exist, do we think perhaps that has helped aid the fear of death. Back when death was common (dark ages for example/anytime before the last 150 years), were people more accepting of it/welcoming towards it?",1

1693440658.0,Why I think a universe with a GOD is not something I want,"I'm a hardcore atheist.  But let's not discuss the truth or falsehood of God, but rather why I wouldn't even hope there is.

Religious people are often shocked to hear this.  Many people's conception of God lies solely within hope itself.

IF there is a God, one of two things MUST be true:

A) God was the start and created the universe and ethics themselves.  What is good and what is bad was solely upon God to decide.

B) What is Good and what is Bad existed as part of reality and God is bring those ethics with him upon his creation.

c\*) (updated 3rd option: counter argument #3 \[below\]) Ethics are human made.

Most religious people get defensive at B.  Probably because God would lose his title as highest power and be limited to constructs of the universe that made him.

Let's go to A.  God made it all including the concept of Good and Evil.

Now we have a universe that some egotistical unknown entity ""decided"" what actions you take are correct and which are incorrect.  You have been enslaved by this God.  You may have free will, but you will still face his judgement and incorrect actions will bring you eternal horror.

Who in their right mind asks to be enslaved?

I am free.  I just deal with the existential dilemmas of nihilism, but I am free.

Hoping for God is hoping for enslavement.  A king that sets the rules and takes away our freedom.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 8/31:

Ok I can't keep up with all the replies, but I've noticed they all say one of only a couple things So I'll get ahead of some of these arguments....

1. If you use the bible or bible verses, I counter with quotes from Harry Potter to prove that wizards are real.
2. ""I have a limited view of God and what that means"".  If God has so many definitions, the word GOD is useless.   Here's a word, ""nslkdnfoe"" I made it up and its super hard to pronounce.  Its definition is anything you subjectively want it to be.  Should we add it to the dictionary?  No, because words are sounds that convey ideas from one person to another.  If a word has multiple fluid meanings, its useless as it is not a sound that conveys an idea from one person to another.

When God was shown NOT to be a dude on a cloud (we created in his imagine) he just became more abstract and heaven was in the cosmos.  We checked he wasn't there so now Heaven is another ""dimension"".

I'm not interested in chasing God into the semantics of the metaphysical.  That's just human thought and word play.

By God I mean:

A. monotheistic

B. It is an entity

C. it is conscious

D. It had something to do with the creation of our reality

*\*\*I'm letting us off the hook on ""god creating humans in his image"" since we proved that false way beyond a reasonable doubt with evolution.  Also its paradoxical as we no longer view God as a dude on a cloud.  So if he's abstract we were obviously NOT created in his image or we would be abstract interdimensional everywhere all the time floating looking things.   So I'm generous here and not using that in the definition.*

&#x200B;

3. Ethics are a Human construct.

Well, if God dictated the reality mechanics, its his construction.

If he allowed us to navigate freely with free will and we just came up with the system of morality, we will still have to settle for his decision of what afterlife is.

If God simple created us and walked away from the universe, that's within my definition as well, however, at this point whether I live in a universe with or without God seems to have no different outcomes.  In which case, I'm still justified in picking the universe without God, cuz the choices are equivalent.

&#x200B;

PS, I've done things Id consider bad, not evil, but I've made mistakes.  The parental God did not scold me, or do anything that I could see.  He doesn't talk to me.  If he's real, he's so quiet I can't see the difference with or without him.

People tell me I'll see when I get to the afterlife, but I've noticed almost all (I think all) of those people are people that are not dead so could not know.  So I'm having trouble trusting their call.

1507308215.0,"What you really mean when you say ""life is meaningless.""","""Life is meaningless."" What does that mean?

It can only mean one of two things: Life is subjectively meaningless, or life is objectively meaningless.

If life is *subjectively* meaningless, then you are simply suffering from a depressive state of mind. In other words, it is a flaw in your perception or mood, not in life itself.

So most of the time, when we say life is meaningless, what we are saying is that life is ""objectively"" meaningless.

But there is no such thing as ""objective meaning."" It's a nonsensical concept. It makes about as much sense as saying ""objective sadness.""

""Meaning"" can only exist for a thinking, feeling being, for a subject. It is necessarily subjective.

So what do we really mean when we say ""objective"" meaning? It could only possibly mean one thing: God.

A chair has purpose because it was created by a carpenter with a purpose: for sitting. A stone (seemingly) has no inherent purpose, because it was not created by a mind for a purpose.

When you say life is meaningless, what you are lamenting is that there is no grand carpenter, no God.

But ultimately you are ignorant of whether or not God exists, whether or not existence has an inherent purpose. It is an assumption on your part (and an arrogant one at that).

So once again we get back to subjective meaning, because what you are describing is a feeling you have, not an objective fact. Again our definition must change...

What you really mean when you say that life is meaningless, is that you are *ignorant* of the ultimate nature of reality. You've been left out of the loop.

What you are expressing is the feeling of alienation from the Divine. Your father has abandoned you, ignored you (or never existed at all).

But perhaps he hasn't abandoned you, perhaps you've abandoned him? Perhaps you've alienated *yourself* from the Divine.

Because when I see beauty in the world, when I stop for a moment and take a look at the incredible and intricate patterns in a single leaf, I don't feel alienated from the Divine.

What I see in the beauty and flow of Nature is God looking back at me.

The Ego, with all it's demands and incessant needs (like ""meaning"") is precisely the thing blinding us to the divine nature of existence itself.",1

1645604744.0,My piece of advice for those suffering with existentialism,"Maybe and only maybe:  In your case you start  with the idea of ""everything"" or ""the universe"". First of all maybe you do not realise that you are not capable of thinking literally of ""everything"" or ""the universe"". You can only generate a rather small inaccurate model of those things. You are not that powerful. In some mental conditions the person confuses the symbols that represent real things -words, thoughts- for instance ""the universe"" with those actual real things for instance the  actual universe. Yo do not have the actual universe within your brain you fool! Nor you have necessarily a mental condition (you can t go mad for thinking these things). All you have in there related to the actual universe is just a symbol that means something.  

Maybe and only maybe: This confusion explains your incapability to later coherently express the things you 'thought' in that moment of anxiety: not because you can not express such thoughts into words but because you actually did not produce such thoughts. You were not thinking, but just in a loop of anxiety. You are mixing up a concept with your fears, which are probably actually related to things that are in your mind and that can be expressed with words. 

My advice: Find those things and those words. Later you will be just fine thinking about those ideas of yours, and you will be able to join the other kids in the playground of zen.",1

""One can judge, first – and perhaps this is not a judgment of value, but it is a logical judgment – that in certain cases choice is founded upon an error, and in others upon the truth. One can judge a man by saying that he deceives himself. Since we have defined the situation of man as one of free choice, without excuse and without help, any man who takes refuge behind the excuse of his passions, or by inventing some deterministic doctrine, is a self-deceiver.""

To commit yourself to conventional practice is to subject yourself to other opinions. This isn't to say that existentialists should habitually engage in contrarianism but rather that the rejection of conformity presents the route to authenticity. Given that parents generally deprive their children of true choice in the matter, should someone who escapes piercing at that time pursue it in adulthood? 

In other words, can one separate her appearance to others from the inclination to determine her own essence? No action constitutes a problem on its own - but given the social ubiquity of aesthetic appeal, can one genuinely act independently on the matter?

1698451121.0,I spilled my thoughts and feelings in a lengthy piece. Curious to hear what you think about it.,"I contemplate a sense of superiority, though often labeled as egocentric, akin to a god. This doesn't negate my belief that we are all gods, creators of our unique worlds and individual lives. Describing myself as superior was an exaggeration; I am awake when society slumbers. Fortunately, not everyone embodies this perspective entirely, yet regrettably, the majority falls short. This is a pivotal aspect that demands transformation—a mere matter of opening our eyes. I don't claim superiority; rather, I'm disheartened by humanity's evolution.

Concurrently, an immense hope propels my endeavors toward a positive transformation. It's akin to escaping a prison cell; mentally, I acknowledge the escape, but I find myself within the confines of another dilemma. It's a ramble, I admit.

To derive mental well-being and decisions externally results in an unfulfilled life. I assert that the power lies within us, accidents notwithstanding. Generally, individuals spend their lives lamenting missed opportunities or comparing themselves to others. A death characterized by fear and regrets, rather than the intended outcome—a demise filled with pride and joy upon reaching life's conclusion.

Even if our goals remain unmet, persistently striving towards them is sufficient for a content departure. That, I posit, encapsulates the essence. Apologies attributing interference to others, even externally altering circumstances, are mere pretexts. Primarily, these individuals grapple with personal issues and haven't grasped the concept of a fulfilled, content demise.

We should not compromise our worldview. Perseverance instills a mindset geared towards pursuing dreams. Perhaps, albeit unlikely, society may collectively evolve through the dissemination of such knowledge across generations. Alarming suicide statistics, particularly among the youth, underscore the generational damage inflicted on society. It's disheartening that someone so young may contemplate opting out.

Meanwhile, others seek external validations for a sense of accomplishment. Criticism is directed at those who choose to depart, deeming it weak and absurd. However, the departed are justified, worn out by diminishing collective hope for societal enlightenment.

Finding strength amid passing generations, burdened by parental expectations, is increasingly challenging. The collective march towards mental hibernation mirrors a zombie-like state, potentially leading to humanity's demise.

In this delicate situation, I feel broken. Yet, a sudden hope propels me forward. Despite humanity's self-destructive tendencies, I commit to sharing my knowledge. It's akin to planting a family tree; if not initiated, it doesn't exist. Embracing one's beliefs is imperative; otherwise, belief remains superficial. Being is a journey; working towards becoming is intrinsic.

This notion varies for each individual. If pursuits are self-fulfilling and non-detrimental to society and others, external opinions become inconsequential. The challenge lies in determining what is truly beneficial for society—an introspective process questioning fundamental beliefs devoid of external influences.

Clearing our minds of external clutter, questioning ourselves, and embracing life, dreams, and non-harmful endeavors are paramount. Wishing for a collective embrace of such principles is essential. Stepping over others is not the path; rather, cherishing life in all its facets, good and bad, is the key.

This philosophy must echo through future generations, offering hope that time will bring positive changes. It commences with someone, with us, envisioning a future that enriches both our internal selves and society in the long run.

I maintain optimism in the possibility of such a future. Dreaming and striving come at no cost. Turning our backs on these aspirations is not an option. We are capable of overcoming challenges and fostering positive change.",1

a few months later, i'm now more curious about the stance of other existentialists outside of my roommate. i have some awareness of existentialism addressing the reality of the condition of the world today, but based on the interactions i've had, i haven't detected much compassion (and sensitivity) amidst suffering of not just themselves but also of others in close relation to them and sometimes i feel the concept of the individual in existentialism is hard to understand critically.

I know it well in how I work meaning into sheer amounts that cloud it back to the forgotten primitive sounds of chattering subconscious instincts. 

It helps me leave what I meant in wisdom before so it eroded myself transforming my form into less, so it retained the graffiti of what I eroded it with as a loss of meaning reducing my purposes to the simplest parts that in the erosion devolved a instinct of the same forgotten meaning that I lost be adapted to. 

Although I guess thats adaptive nihilism and not nihilism of solely the void where none mean.

I am instead more fond of braving the existential futilism with the adaptive nihilism, that leaves me to my own demise in the consequences of what I choose as my desired downfall into the abyss instead. 

Since in trowing myself to my inconsequential doom of chased desire I am ever swallowed by, the wants I lived cascade my futile deconstruction into the timeless result of my actions. As in how I chose that demise wanted, is futile in the hopeless of what is anything in the abyss that ever draws me closer.

Thus while I am a pardemidt of meaning, I am also one that lives in the angles as a dog deman so my philosophy of life is less platonic.

It is somewhat platonic but only in the beyonds of meaningless futility I once sought to overcome in forms greater but in hopelessness I accepted instead. 

Yet doing so allowed me to then asunder the overcome by transcendence out of the cavern of shadows, into the forms of essentially my existential vacuum of abyssal madness found sanity in not what I feared of the fire but what I could also do with what was good of it in the polar trinity of its nature.

Since to me their is no ammorality or morality but instead the averence of the good, bad and mundane in the manner of applications of anything. 

So the existential futility and meaningless void I live within are transcental to the nightmares, while I still posses their strengths in either needed application. 

Thus with my carnal cynicism I live my selfish ends of psychological depth in the nullity of that tri polar transcendental moral ammorality, that brings about my capacity to act as choosing in what to most seems like a dead end of death but to me is an afterlife of hellish paradise in pure sanctity. 

Since the light of a shadow is always being the mundane object that in knowing the full three reveals a hellish paradise to be a heavenly city instead. 

As this perhaps is a noted peculiar of my debauched dancing, in what seems deathly but brought me back to life after suicide into the haunting tragedy is a philosophy of living in what is the seeming opposite.

Your consciousness is in your brain, so if the brain dies, your consciousness dies too. It'll be just like before you were born, or just like right now if you have a dreamless sleep. Nothing to worry about.

But I can't ignore the fact that our existence is absurd in itself, because there's literally no reason for us to exist and experience life (let alone the whole universe to exist).

So, I can't ignore the following facts:

* there should've been something which created matter out of nothing, enabling the Big Bang

* there should be a good reason why I am conscious about life as myself in this very body at this very time and place, and not as e.g. a native American in the 14th century (it just feels arbitrary because for the same chances I could've been experiencing life as you, and you life as me)

This again leads me to believe, that there must be some sort of deity who can create matter and souls (aka consciousness) out of nothing. 

This again makes me at least assume the possibility of an afterlife.

But the question here is: Are there any deities at all? And if there are deities, which are the ""true ones""? And if I know which are the true ones, will there be an afterlife? And if so, what can I do right now so I won't worry about my fate in the afterlife?

Which was very comforting to me, I preferred the idea over an eternal afterlife.

But in my mid twenties my philosophy began to change. I began thinking, it doesn't make much sense. Reality has never been 'nothing', because for 'nothing' to exist as a concept of a lack of 'something', then 'something' must too exist.

The argument people make that ""Death is an empty void just like the empty void that came before life"" is an extremely easy to disprove theory in my opinion. Your brain is what holds your consciousness, it is a material thing. It cannot remember what consciousnesses came before and after, it only stores information locally. So if we lived as infinite consciousnesses forever before and after being a human, our brain simply would never know.

What is your guys's take on this? This is all a bit of a batshit crazy theory but it's what I truly believe, when we die, we will experience 'everything' that can and will exist as long as time and reality is an infinite thing, and through our different consciousnesses, we will likely never remember anything that came before or after.

Or, even more bizzarely, we may be born into a consciousness that randomly had all the thoughts of all its previous and future existences stored locally through complete random chance, and then you would die and be reborn as a bird or some shit.

Non-religious and all that.  It basically encourages you to make your own meaning and helps people work through their problems from an existentialist perspective.  BUT.  The church itself would have a bar, casino, strip club, fights, and a buffet.  So...it'd kind of have a hedonism bent.  Because A) that's kind of where I am and B) I suspect that's where most people kind of wind up.

Anyone ever read Stranger in a Strange Land?  Remember that hyper-commercial church?  Kinda like that, but without the supernatural bullshit and preserved corpses.

Instead of having a preacher, you'd have a member of the church talking about an interesting topic.  Sometimes it might be the subjectivity of morality, but other times it might be something like the benefit of loving the people in your life even more *because* of the impermanence of life.

After that, it'd basically be open-mic for random members to come up and say their piece for the next half-hour.  Each would get 5 minutes, to keep it fair.  And there'd be a wait-list.  Then, the buffet/strip-club/etc. would open up.  And honestly, I'm not averse to letting members come up to try out a standup routine or play their music.  It might be a good way for people to connect with the community.

The church itself would do weddings, community outreach stuff, serve all the other functions of a regular church...but it'd be existentialist. 

You'd have weekly get-togethers, and there'd be a definite sense of community to it all.  But you'd basically sit down for a 10 minute lecture, 30 minutes of randos in the audience raising issues, and then whatever kind of fun you like.  Obviously you wouldn't be obvious about the adult-oriented things, and you wouldn't let kids in to them...and you'd probably need more kid-oriented fun shit...maybe an arcade or like laser-tag...maybe like a Dave & Busters with an edge down in the basement.

Is anyone else at all interested in something like this?  

I know there's not a lot of people out there calling themselves ""existentialists"", but I think that mostly has to do with it being kind of an obscure label.  I think the basic idea behind it (especially the more hedonistic path) could gain a lot of traction if it were presented through something like this.

Anyone?

...hello?

EDIT: oh and from right before that 30-minute bit on, the kids would probably go to something like ""sunday school"".  Except instead of preaching, they'd get to play dodgeball and shit.  Then, their parents can go have fun for a few hours knowing their kids are safe.  There shouldn't be any pushing of this stuff on the kids.  They basically hear the quick thing in the beginning, which would stress subjectivity wherever necessary, and then they'd go do fairly wholesome things in a safe-environment without any sort of preaching.",1

With climate change , globalization and the eventual total automation of the workforce, 

human society (or whatever remains of it) will eventually have no choice but to enter an egalitarian utopian state as opting for an illusionary hierarchal world will become so illogical that any attempt to uphold it will be forced, artificial and counter evolutionary for the sole and deliberate sake of creating adversity and meaning.

Utilitarianism is bound to surpass human nature which will lead us to a point of complete existential dread. By observing life from an overarching perception, the irony of evolution becomes clear. We literally evolve to destroy ourselves.

We can clearly see the early effects of this realization in advanced secular Asian countries such as China, South Korea and Japan where the leading cause of death amongst men between the ages of
20 - 44 and women 15 - 34 is suicide.

By embracing morality and its natural conclusion
Intelligent life as a collective can only follow one viable path which is that of an authoritarian Ai controlled organ harvesting eugenical vegan communist world.

Anything else would be hypocritical and inconsistent with any sort of objective truth which renders whatever it is completely meaningless.

How could we find meaning under these hypothetical conditions?",1
1690239982.0,The anti life or anti existence philosophy of negative existentialism.," 

OK, let me break it down properly, lets see if this argument makes sense. 

&#x200B;

1. The absolute worst suffering that NOBODY wants do exist in this world, no matter how you subjectively measure it, its will be horrible for 100% of people.
2. Some people DO suffer so much that death would be preferred, this is an absolute tragedy, it would be absurd to claim such a life is preferred by ANYBODY (sane people).
3. I must stress again, this is the worst suffering possible, NOBODY can endure it and their victims will honestly tell you that they'd rather be dead or never born into such HELLISH fates. Their subjective and honest testimonies would be the best benchmark for the value of their existence, no?
4. There are many reasons why these victims cant just end themselves, such as full paralysis, cant even speak or blink, but can feel pain and fully conscious, trapped in their own body, kept alive by family for years and decades, until their minds go insane from the torture and pain. Also no euthanasia laws in their countries.
5. Other horrors include children who were kidnapped, trafficked, raped, tortured and murdered, in no particular order but it all happened to the SAME CHILD.
6. It would be insane to say these cases are not real and that people could just end themselves in these situations. They literally CANT, lol, they absolutely wanted to, but they cant, a long list of things could have prevented them from finishing their own lives. Anybody who claims otherwise should be put in such a situation and see how impossible it is to escape.
7. And many victims WANTED to live, they DONT want to die, but bad luck and malice still got to them and they end up suffering till death, either biologically or murdered in the end. You CANNOT tell these victims to just end themselves. lol
8. Even for those who CAN end themselves, it would still be a HUGE tragedy to live such a life, to suffer so much that they had to end it, this is IN NO WAY, SHAPE or FORM an acceptable ""solution"" for their suffering. Its ridiculously inhumane and selfish to just say ""Oh you can always end yourself"", as if such a thing could totally erase the fact that they suffered horribly before their suicide. People who say this to these victims are MONSTERS.
9. Now this is the important part, most experts of science and tech would agree that a utopia with no such horror is unlikely to be achieved, because suffering is a moving target, physically and mentally, heck even AI could suffer according to some AI experts. We can argue about the possibility of a suffering free utopia but it would be super dishonest to claim that its around the corner, lol.
10. ANIMALS, both wild and livestock/pets cannot escape from such fates either, in fact, most biologists would agree that trillions of wild animals and billions of livestock go through similar if not worse suffering. Wild animals have no possibility of alleviating their pain either, many died brutally before adulthood, eaten, parasitized, starved, infected, slow and brutal deaths. If you think a human Utopia is impossible, it would be astronomically impossible for wild animal utopia. lol
11. So, after knowing these EMPIRICAL facts about the absolute worst sufferings in existence and how we may never escape them, why would it be moral to continue existing? ESPECIALLY when we have the means to destroy the world and end this lottery of hell for the unlucky ones? (ex: NASA has the tech to redirect HUGE asteroid towards earth, future nanotech could also shut everyone down, painlessly, even current euthanasia tech is pretty good.)
12. If you think such life erasing tech is difficult to develop, just compare it to Utopian tech, which one do you think is actually impossible? Because destroying things is MUCH EASIER than creating PERFECT existence, hands down, this is why life is only discovered on earth. If we wanna bet on which technology and outcome are more likely, I think you know which one will win first. lol

Summary: Thus it is argued that erasing life to prevent the worst suffering for the worst victims is not only moral, its also way more practical and achievable than Utopia. This means we have a moral obligation to choose the former.

Unless you have a totally unintuitive and selfish moral philosophy that compels you to exist and procreate despite the existence of these random victims (which could be your descendants, if you roll the dice enough times), meaning your moral codes dont care about these victims enough and have no problem with them suffering perpetually for endless generations, as long as you are not one of the victims. Some would argue that this ""moral"" philosophy would be deeply immoral. lol

Ok, Steelman done, what say you now? What is your counter argument?

Is it morally ok to exist at the expense of these unlucky victims of unpreventable and horrible, hellish suffering? Some would say yes, but then they would have a deeply immoral way of life based on their privileged existence, dont you think?",1

1686669654.0,What if god feels emotions?,"(I’m brand new to this sub, so I’m sorry if I’m not able to explain this the best way Xb)

For the past week, I’ve been kind of stuck on this loop of different possibilities after the end. I’ve come to a couple of conclusions, but the one that bothers me the most by far is what if I were to be god, but I still feel have the same emotions and thoughts as a human does?  Like, what if god, cannot confirm whether or not they ARE god? 

Though, I have kind of rationalized this possibility by determining for god to feel those things they would need to have created a vessel. From how I see it, god is probably a force rather than a being, as god being born with a body and/or emotions implies there’s a higher being that gave them those attributes to begin with. However, the main problem I’ve had with the vessel concept is about what kind of restrictions could have been put on this vessel? Like, what could it potentially do, what damage could it cause, simply in an attempt to prove it is the being above all? Would it feel responsibility just because it’s the creator, or perhaps true bliss so it doesn’t feel the need to justify it’s existence? 

And even worse, what if this were to be true, but in the form of solipsism? What if you were to meet your end, just to find out nothing was real and being forced to endure feelings of anger and sadness because of it? And worse yet, not being able to do a thing about it?

It’s just so terrifying to imagine the concept of god not being able to determine whether or not they are the all-creator, and I can’t get the thought out of my head. Does anyone know what I could do in an effort to stop thinking about these things?",1

I've always been interested in astrology and understanding the universe, the concept of time and ofcourse what happens when you die, which is a scary thought for me at the moment but not what this is about. Anytime ive brought this up to anyone I've either failed to explain myself properly or they couldn't understand what i ment, I've had this thought for over 6 months and everytime i wonder i get nowhere. This isn't much philosophical but a literal way of looking at it. So before we are born there is nothing, no flow of time we are nowhere and nothing. And one day we wake up ""assigned"" a body and we start living the moment we gain consciousness. Now what I want to know is what is it that has made us all gain consciousness in this era, that we are all alive and conscious now, because before we are born there is no indication that we would gain consciousness in whatever year we did. How does it all happen that we do now and not say a few thousand years ago or into the future. Or even an animal or a tree, maybe they would have to have a consciousness first and be aware of their existence but even all that is a concept of our creation. It makes absolutely no sense that i am the child of my parents and born now, instead of another thing. Is my consciousness a creation of my genetics and i could only be aware as i am now in this body?
Even so it would mean that i had to be born. Obviously no one will have any answers or explanation for this im only looking for someone that understands me and can expand on what im trying to say, the only way i can put it into perspective is like every body was once an empty vessel and our consciousness was deposited into it by some godly power or just chance. Maybe it is all just chance that i am not a tree now.

I've been thinking about this, and I agree with Nietzsche. I do believe that religion, especially the ascetic ones, are denying people's both the real value of life and the concern of other people's life.

For instance, I was watching Star Wars, and it has tons of religious undertones(I'm using it as an example since its very popular in the USA and Americans through Christianity have a similar conception of life). For example, when Luke attacks the Death Star, he sees his friends being killed and brushed it off as a fact of life.

Meanwhile, the ""ghost"" of Obi-Wan is guiding Luke. The reader reads between the lines that it doesn't matter if someone dies, he'll come back as a ghost, and everything will be fine. The same is the case with the Empire officials. Luke mass murders thousands of people who were in the Death Star and celebrated it with his friends afterward.

I find all of this extraordinarily troublesome since my understanding of Death has switched from becoming a ghost to potentially eternal oblivion.

Sometimes I’ll talk to people about it and it boggles my mind how many people don’t believe in it. I can see the majority of people in this sub believe nothing happens after death. Of course we’re all entitled to our own beliefs. Whether it’s reincarnation, heaven, hell, or the void. I’m going to display why I feel so positive that reincarnation is what truly happens. 

So at some point, YOU didn’t exist. You were in a state of non existence. Then, out of nowhere, you were born and came to existence. One day, you’re going to die. It could happen in 5 years, or 500 years if we have some kind of reverse aging technology. Then, you will go back to non existence. You see where I am going with this? Is it really crazy to assume that maybe, just maybe, YOU will exist again? If you want from non existence, to existence, and then back to non existence, it only makes sense that you’ll then, go back to EXISTENCE! 

Another thing people fail to realize is that if you believe in reincarnation, half of your belief already came true. Think about it for a second. You literally came to life. Reincarnation is the belief that it’s just simply going to happen again. So half of your belief has already come true. However, no one has actually been to heaven, hell, or experienced the void. So reincarnation comes the closest to actually being real because we’ve already experienced half of it. 

If you take a look at nature, everything is always on a loop. Day and night repeats itself. The weather repeats itself. The trees lose their leaves and then get them back. People die and then people are born. The Earth makes one complete rotation on its axis every 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is rounded up to 24 hours. Even though time is a made up concept. This is why I believe so strongly that we will reincarnate. If everything is on a loop, my existence to non existence and then back to existence theory makes even more sense. This existence we live in, as far as we know, is infinite! 

This next section I know I’m going to lose a lot of you. But it’s ok! I also do believe there is some sort of afterlife. Maybe a temporary place we go to so we can figure out our next journey. Maybe we really can be reborn onto other planets. Maybe I’ll be reborn as me again but in a parallel universe where I’ll get to make different decisions. Maybe we will reincarnate into higher planes of existence in bodies that are more advanced then the human body. What if humans aren’t the final form and we just think it is because we haven’t seen what’s truly out there? 

The possibilities are truly endless in this infinite universe. The only downside is we won’t actually know that we reincarnated because every life is going to feel like our first lives. But it’s always made the most sense to me. If I am correct, to the person reading this, I hope your next life is better then the one you’re living now!",1

Heaven, Paradise, Jannah, Swarga, Eden — different names, of the same place. This is an afterlife destination of eternal peace and happiness. This is a reward for the believers.

What is another option? I guess you already know. 

Hell.

There the 'truth' is my desire, ergo that wants this article to be wrong, I've no need to argue why it  is, if I accept it as true. Classic mistake in an all embracing metaphysics. 

But just for fun!


> The real problem is about how science assumed something about the world, which it is wrong about — which is that the world is rational. 

It didn't, quite the reverse, and this is the **big mistake** in the article. The history of science has been to challenge what is accepted. So the earth is not stationary, heavy objects do not fall faster than lighter ones... and with the beginning of the 20thC in science, the law of the excluded middle has not authority in science. Special relativity, and Quantum Mechanics ignore this rule of logic. 


> Our rational brain is like a hammer that is looking for nails, but there are no actual nails.

We have no 'rational'  part of the brain any more than we have a part that does long division, or has the rules of cricket. A hammer has a purpose...  was designed for a purpose, we can imagine how it was modified from being a rock, and the used  with a wood dowel perhaps, so the hammer is part of the hammer / nail tool. To say humans invented hammers before nails is in technical terms 'daft'. 


> Most of what happened later in philosophy was a chain of responses to ancient philosophers. 

Nope. Sometimes yes, but not always. New concepts were created. Some based on old ones, others novel.  e.g. Kant's response to Hume. Or acceptance, Schopenhauer's acceptance of Kant, his rejection of Hegel. Wittgenstein's rejection of philosophy.  


> Think of science as a burrowing outward using rational thinking, and philosophy as the burrowing inward into the assumptions of thinking itself. 

This is also wrong. You can identify two trends in early modern philosophy, Idealism, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, knowledge base on thinking, abstract ideas, and Empiricism Locke, Hume, Hobbes, Berkeley...  ""knowledge is based on experience"". 

More recently the 'continental' Vs 'Anglo American'...  and now post-modern.

> We rationalize our instincts, which are otherwise irrational by default.

Evidence? Fight or flight seems eminently rational. Watch a spider catch a fly in a web, poison it, wrap it and store it. Now is it being rational? Are plants rational? As Deleuze points out that a certain orchid has a flower which mimics the sex organs of a certain wasp in order to cross pollinate with other orchids. Not even here an instinct! But it makes sense to us.

Air line pilots, brain surgeons, plumbers all seem to employ rationality. As is the author of the article while I'm instinctively attacking. Grrrr.

We see everyday humans behaving purely instinctively.  Does system 1 want us to wash, get dressed in hot weather, use a bathroom to urinate... refrain from violence, obey traffic signals. Do alligators drive Ford Pickups, and fill them with gas when needed paying with a credit card?

I hesitated to write here but I feel the need to share my views on relationship and confront my ideas through rational prism.I've always been single and mostly rejecting romantic love and couple. I'm a man of 27 yo. This rejection has extended to love in all forms, including family and friends, even though it didn't last as I got into very dark mental places.

I will focus below on romantic love

1. **Attraction** to someone based on psychological and/or physical characteristics  
the formula is highly complex and by no mean do I try to master it, but it's interesting to try list some factors- one's scent and overall physical chemistry- physical attributes, attitude or character that is reminiscent of one's figure contemplated in his environment or seems complementary at given time in their life- sexual desire also nurtured by the above, hormones and complex factors
2. **Projections**  
beyond attraction, projections nurture the idea that the object is able to respond to some human primary needs: affective, sexual, inner void, sense of meaning,...
3. **Chemical bound**  
when the two above are met, should it be instantly of after some time, chemical response will eventually bound the two and be identified as first sign of Love arisingI don't associate love with this chemical reaction, so that a crush is not necessarily Love, but it may start with it
4. **Pairing, needs bound and material strenghtening**  
pairing can take the form of an exclusive couple, or any other form (open relationship,...)but one's recognize his love and expresses it, and it's met with reciprocality in feelings.  
It comes with the charge  to participate in fulfilling part of affective needs of each otherIt's a contract which terms are not explicited, demanding active participation of both into fulfilling these needs.   
Both demand and love reinsurance can be expressed through a Love discourse (do you love me? I love you), or other active proofs overtime.  
There can be social constructs aiming at securing love (and therefore needs fulfillment) under forms of Marriage, family, material mutual possessions and life projects making it difficult, consciously but often inconsciously, to come to separation later. Not all of the listed is strictly deriving from need to secure love but they can be part of it
5. **Projections disappointment and Chemical bound fading**  
eventually one comes to realize the other is not up to his initial projections which can have effect on the chemical bound that therefore ceases to effect. it can be that one has his needs changing overtime which the other object cannot respond to due to his own characteristics that do not match anymoreIn any case, the chemical bound cannot be sustained overtime and certainly shouldn't have to. It can derive from the projections break it was primarily made to bound into pairing
6. **Attraction fading**  
as desire is nurtured in the absence and risk, and that such love object is easily accessible, attraction can also fade
7. **Attachment & some needs bound**  
what persists in the end can be attachment meaning habit and comfort in the romantic relationship, along with needs that can continue being satisfied. Great risk to it is boredom 

In light of the above, i've always seen love as an exchange of needs on basis of complex factors attraction and needs bounds. Two objects are using each others as to move on in life.I deeply struggle seeing the inherent virtue of this exchange, apart from common idea that it's a need we must compel to

I like to use **extremes to put to the test general ideas**:Now in application to the above

\- what if a man fells in love with a man who shares characteristics of an abuser, and gets being exploited as a prostitute. He will certainly feel Love, and who are we to question it? Some may say it's an exception because he's under influence, yet one can be attracted to abuser characteristics, and will be seeking such object of Love in life. 

\- what if a disabled man meets a woman who sees in him the possibility to achieve meaning in life while having sense of security since he is not able to harm her physically. Now this man recovers and she is losing power and meaning she once had. Remains eventually attachment which may fade with boredom. Was there virtue in this Love?

1691072301.0,Rate My Essay on Nietzsche's The Genealogy of Morality," 

What is morality and does it actually work in today’s society? Friedrich Nietzsche’s *On the Genealogy of Morals* sets out to answer this question. Guilt, or “bad conscience” as Nietzsche calls it, developed as our civilization became more advanced through our relationships with others. He comes to a conclusion about the origin of morality, and realizes that if this system continues, we may fall into widespread nihilism. Man must set out to find a new set of values to combat this. 

To explain how bad conscience came about, Nietzsche illustrates a three part story. The first step was the making of promises. We must ask ourselves, what is a promise and how do we make one? Let’s say you promise to your friend to pick them up after school. First, you give them your word that you will do what you promised.  Now you are expected to fulfill your promise because that person trusts you, but what is keeping you from abandoning your friend? This is the third and most important step in a promise, the threat of condemnation. That may seem far fetched, but imagine what would happen if you just left your friend there and did not fulfill your promise? They would have to walk home from school in the pouring rain, cursing your name, and talking all about how you left him there alone. You have given him the authorization to condemn you if you do not fulfill your promise. Your “social stock” goes down and people are less trusting of you and this is where bad conscience (guilt) starts to creep in.

So how does a promise get this much power over us and why would we allow people to condemn us if we do not follow through? Promises must first be a widely accepted trait in society, because otherwise it would not make as much sense to allow them to condemn you. Now that promises are common, the community must allow some agreements to serve on the pain of condemnation. It may seem that promises and threats now seem inseparable from each other, but this is false.  Threats are proven useful in tactics to get people to do what they want, enacted solely by one party wanting the other to do or get what they desire, but promises are agreed upon conditions set up by both parties. Throughout human history, torture has been a proven method to command people to pay back their debt.

Threats transition to tradition, where a higher power exists that one must obey. A higher power may not be useful to us as a society, but you obey anyways because of its power, or “because it commands”(D 9). This is not the same as the general feeling of fear because the higher power holds an incomprehensible amount of influence and a higher intellect. There is a superstition in this kind of fear. Nietzsche attempts to understand this relationship through the idea of having a “creditor-debtor” relationship. The debtor is a person that owes something to the creditor, in order to pay it off, he “pawns something to the creditor by means of the contract in case he does not pay,” (GM II 5). Allowing the creditor to do something bad to the debtor if he shall not pay back his debt, the most common method back then being torture. Through this relationship, the first community comes about from coercion. More specifically, the powerful and organized community violently threatens the population from this relationship to create against the disorganized nomadic people. More power is gained through threats and promises and only the ones who follow this process will survive as a society.

The concept of guilt starts to come about as a representation of the unpaid debt the debtor still owes. There is now a new set of commands, especially for the lower class of people. Instincts are basic to every animal, including humans, but this version of society forces us to keep these instincts inside and therefore turn inward against us. They are rendered totally useless to us now and in fact now serves as a hindrance to our role in civilization. We torture our own kind because these natural instincts are not allowed to be portrayed externally. Due to the lack of external enemies, we turn against ourselves, and cause ourselves psychological pain in order to someday receive pleasure from it, but it never comes. This society follows the morality of custom, which means that the morality consists in obedience to customs, no matter what they may represent or benefit.

Through generations of this system of debtor-creditor, there starts to be a new kind of debt formed, the debt we owe to our ancestors. There are now two debts man must watch out for:

the debt we owe to our community, and the debt to past generations. The sense of guilt man feels has increased dramatically, and there is now an obligation required of us to our ancestors, not solely to respect and honor them, but to follow their customs and live up to them. In a tribal sense, they would have been the first to make this community possible, and we cannot forget their sacrifices. In the present day, the achievement of one’s parents imposes an obligation, which acts as a major burden on a young teen’s shoulders; thus another creditor-debtor relationship is made in the process.  This in turn restricts the vision that one possesses, further igniting their inner bad conscience.

As the first communities develop further and grow in population, religion develops alongside it. God is now introduced as the highest power, and people are now able to expect eternal salvation from Him, but this also comes with its own debts. The Christian God requires man to follow another set of tasks to get to this eternal salvation. As soon as a Christian is born, they have already made a promise to God to fulfill this debt and follow his rules. They did not agree to a set of terms before they were born, yet they must follow these terms in order to have the privilege of being alive. Now they must fulfill their “promise” to God. If they do not, they suffer the worst possible punishment possible, being eternally condemned to suffering beyond imagination. As in Christianity God has created the entire universe we occupy, the amount of debt Christians owe to God is near infinite. Bad conscience now becomes so embedded into human life that man convinces himself that the paying back of all this debt is impossible. In Christianity, this curse of original sin is not the present generation's fault, but was enacted by the first man, Adam, which has been passed down to us through the process of birth. The present generation is responsible for the sin committed many millennia ago, so now man must take accountability for something he had no part in. There is now no avoiding the eternal punishment of God and his unimaginable wrath. Once condemned to torture what can man do? He will develop to eventually renounce God himself, to avoid this inevitability. 

Renouncing God comes with its own set of problems as well. As a civilization, we require obligations and duties to be followed. These obligations draw from bad conscience, or our guilt, about not fulfilling our debt to the authority, which God was up until this point. If we are to abandon him, we must find a replacement for his authority, a new kind of creditor, so that society can keep operating. Man proposes that morality could be the new authority we answer to, a new set of values and obligations that we are able to fulfill to our new creditor. The problem is, there really is no actual being we can feel indebted to as morality is not a true authority we can call a creditor. 

Moral obligation steps in to settle this dilemma by demanding our allegiance to its values. This however does not conceal the fact that there is no figure we can owe debt to, morality is not a creditor we can feel indebted to, therefore there is no creditor-debtor relationship. There is a reason that we are in debt to our community, ancestors, and God, each one gives man a unique advantage to survive. Man is indebted to their community for giving them an opportunity to survive, our shelter, food, water, all of our basic necessities are met thanks to his community. We are in debt to our ancestors for establishing and upholding the community, without them, we would be akin to wild animals, and lose our advantages of community. However, we are most indebted to God, who created the whole Earth, plants, and animals around us, as well as the entire human species. What has morality done for us so that we need to pay it back? There is nothing to pay back because that debt does not exist, even if morality could exist as a creditor, there is nothing we owe to it. We are supposed to follow the notion of moral obligation because we “ought to” or it is the right thing to do, but Nietzsche claims that we do everything for our own personal motives, and following through on debts is to our advantage, but man will not follow morality if he himself in not indebted to it. These debts are created by us as a by-product of giving up our own instincts, so man can live peacefully and have ease of access to basic necessities. Every advantage offered by society commands that you pay a price for it, like getting a job, family, and fulfilling your role as a member of this community.

Nietzsche argues that good and bad are words that were formed from the aristocratic class, which includes the priests and warriors. The powerful and rich dictated the use and structure of these basic words like “good” which originally meant that you were noble, rich, strong, healthy, and powerful. Bad meant the opposite, meaning poor, hungry, weak, or low on the economic and social scale. The warriors, who were at the top of this hierarchy, were able to claim these definitions of good as having defeated less skilled warriors in combat. These lower warriors were given the title of “priest,” who are given a slightly lower rank compared to the warriors for having been defeated. This builds up their natural instinct of resentment towards the warriors because of their hatred of being below them, so they create new definitions of what it means to be good or bad so they can satisfy their desire for power. The priests create new values for these words, therefore giving them less and less meaning over time, man cannot truly know what is good or bad (assuming there is a true form of each) and this will lead us to reject living the good life. If man cannot even identify the basics of what is “good,” we cannot even start to create more complex values. After man realizes his debts to God cannot be repaid, he knows he is irredeemable, and his existence is essentially worthless. We find temporary relief in the fact that God comes down to earth to redeem the human race, but the infinite amount of debt we have accrued from just being alive remains a crucial dilemma. Morality attempts to be a buffer to stop us from descending into nihilism, but fails due to its problems mentioned earlier. Nietzsche argues that this rejection of the good life will lead to a “nihilism of despair” which is “the recognition that our highest values cannot be realized” (Reginster 35). Our wishes of being one with God are known now to be impossible to achieve, so man gives up. He turns away, rejects existence itself,  and desires nothingness.

Nietzsche’s genealogical method consists of two parts: the first being conceptual-descriptive where he traces back the lineage of our moral concepts. He does this by asking us to picture a collection that we may think of as well historically-informed and contextual language games. He illustrates this vivid image of his concepts in order for us to achieve a deeper understanding of them. The other part is empirical-prescriptive, which asks us to observe how people act and feel, and to draw our own conclusions based on this. We are to evaluate others’ behavior and join the conceptual and practical worlds. The conceptual-descriptive is less convincing as it does not have much historical backing towards it, and Nietzsche can sometimes go on long rants about his theories without much historical context, which gives the arguments slightly less credit. On the contrary, the empirical-perspective relates to our personal lives. While most philosophers stop after they make their own concepts, Nietzsche questions if this could really be important and useful to us everyday. Nietzsche proves that morality in itself is flawed; humans are not indebted to it and therefore will not perform obligations on its behalf. ",1

What if there are multiple A resurrections? It’d be like a cell splitting into two, right? Both would have equal claim to A. But from A’s original pov, how would it feel? Which one would that stream of consciousness go to? 

Additionally, if person A goes to sleep, gets cloned exactly 100% down to their molecules, DNA, and neurons. Why doesn’t person A suddenly wake up as their clone?",1

The truth about reality at its fundamentals itself is there are no binary answers. both in mathematics and in physical systems.    
at its core itself is a paradox. a stable unstable system. 

there are no right or wrong. good or bad. ying and yang.   
the truth is whatever you want it to be. or more accurately what you believe it to be. 

So, believe.  Believe in nothing but one crucial fundamental truth.  

believe in your own truth.   
what you believe in.

1686180083.0,That box theory stuff,"I forgot the name but like the theory goes like this: In a 4D space time is like a frame that's playing all at once so we aren't moving through time were just going through it. So for example someone in 3D space would see their hand moving through the air but a 4D being would see a different amount of hands moving through the hair (their all the same hands btw).

Now that we have that explained I want to sort of build on it. We'll start with you, you or your current conscience is one out of the infinite conscience within you're being that's moving through time as well, to get to the point your current conscience with the other infinite amount is moving through the frame and another you (or your conscience) goes in the previous frame that you were in.

Now that's we've established that I want to say I believe that time happens all at once which means you have and will continue to die an infinite amount of times and you will be born an infinite amount of times, your conscience dies but your being never does so you (your conscience)  may never experience your life but your being will.

What does this mean? Well this means that there isnt a beginning because no matter what even if there was something to ""start"" it, it moves through time therefore its happening an infinite number of times therefore you can't start this loop. Were basically immortal and like gods and stuff and this means that the universe never ends, the universe conscience may end but its being never ends.

I don't know but that's just a theory and what I believe is happening I'm probably wrong but if I'm right then do what you will with this info.


TLDR; There's a infinite amount of your conscience and you all are going through the frame that is time, you also can't start time because it's already happened. This means you're immortal in your being and nothing ever ends it only repeats itself.",1

It has gotten worse to the point where I believe I have figured out why it is true and the reason that no one else understands me when I explain it to them is because it is just me realizing the truth of  life. I keep having this realization that there could not possibly be more than one consciousness because I can't understand then how there would be a difference between each of us. We all would feel the same feeling of being ""me"" so what distinguishes me from you, etc? It makes sense in my head how it would be IMPOSSIBLE for there to be multiple separate consciousnesses and it leaves me feeling so alone and scared.

The major idea of Existentialism is that we all have radical free will in order to define and understand ourself.  (My basic understanding). 

On my question is that this philosophy originated in a particular social context of the post-world war scenario which was looking for an answer as to how millions of humans got divided into arbitrary boundaries of nations.

Perhaps in such of context where identities were dissolved in a collective imagination of nationalism an assertion of self will and individuality that rejected the demands of sacrifice were necessary. 

However, nationalism in the post colonial world had a very different background where such nationalism ( often predicated on a majoritarian identity) was necessary in order to mobilize against oppressive colonial forces.

So I’ve been on this journey for 2 years now and I’ve got all these different realisations regarding life, death, being human, what is beyond human reality, God, and stuff like that. 
I’ve accepted some some different philosophies on these. Mostly I believe, or feel, that I am a part of everything, and that everything is part of nothing and for me that is God. I’ve felt that on *all* of my trips, meditations and day to day life and I do believe that. 
But, and here’s the but, that fucks with me, I sometimes feel that I am nothing more than just atoms and molecules arranged in such an order that this arrangement itself, the brain, is the thing that gives me consciousness. And I don’t see God in that. I want to, but I can’t. 
The feeling that I am nothing more, than just a brain in a human meat bag suit gives me bad leves of depersonalization and derealization, but in the end, that is all true. I am a brain in a meatbag suit.

1579134222.0,"Criticism of Existentialists, Not Existentialism","Let me preface this with a reiteration of the title: this post is not an attempt to dismantle or deconstruct the logic behind existentialism. This is an attack on the motivator of existentialists.




I, myself, have been a staunch existentialist for a very long time. This has been changing recently. Changing in response to an extremist position into existentialism that I took. Brief synopsis: I became so existentially entrenched that I began to ""explore the unknown"" with the use of psychotropic drugs; psilocybin and marijuana. In this experience, I became intellectually lost. I began to think that the absurdist logic in Sartre's ""Nausea"" was so correct that it began to invade my psyche. The shores of the known were so far behind me that I could not ground myself. Everything was disjointed, meaningless, nauseating, and stressful. I have since begun putting myself back together by replacing what I would describe as a crippling philosophy with axiomatic, positivist ideas. I think that is what is meant by a leap of faith. When speaking of a leap of faith, we are doing something more honest than ""accepting the nihilistic and absurd nature of reality"". I found that what existentialists mean when they ""accept"" this horrible facet of reality is not what they purport it to mean. What they really mean is: ""life is horrible and I must escape it by narrativising it into meaninglessness"". This can be for any number of reasons: dissociation from one's mistakes, formulation of a false persona, self-delusion, regrets. In any case, existentialism seems to be the intellectual form of depression. Alcohol for the intelligent man, so-to-speak. A true leap of faith is actually the true acceptance of the harshness of reality. It means to accept the harshness, and in spite of that, decide to live in a way that ""rages against the dying of the light"". To truly accept the harshness of reality, you must move past the startling realization of life's detritus, and decide to live in a way that revivifies the decay you have stumbled across. Existentialism does not do this. It kicks one when they are down. It draws them out deep into the waters of the unknown so far from reality that it is impossible to construct your own meaning. Man is not an island. He must live a certain distance from the shore of mankind's ancient knowledge, but not so far that he cannot see the ancient traditions. As much as it sucks, each of us must live in a way that allows us to build off of the faulty wisdom of the past, not in a way that allows us to build our own wisdom, because this is impossible . I have decided that this, for me, means true integration of myself. True love for myself and others, and accepting what I know hurts me and others, and accepting past mistakes and regrets, and then doing my best to remedy that.





TLDR: Existentialism is the smart man's depression. Don't let ""smart"" plug your ego, in my estimation, the blind follower of existentialism is a fool of the highest order. Out of touch with himself to the degree that he must create a narrative to protect himself from his inner demons.





Now let me say that the intellectual integrity and cohesiveness of existentialism is intriguing and solid. It is a very coherent philosophy. That is not what I am attempting to criticize. I am attempting, rather, to point out where this worldview fits into the worldview ""toolbox"". It seems to come out when we are distressed, lost, and depressed.",1

1699410269.0,Death= time travel…,"There’s an aspect about death that really freaks me out. Basically, I don’t really know how to explain this but death is like “a time machine vehicle”.

I’ll try to explain.

When I was rying to comprehend and imagine how “forever” will feel. Someone on here said “to close your eyes and count to 1, that’s how long forever will feel”.  I’ve found this very interesting and it stuck with me. It makes sense. There’s no sense of time in death, and so wouldn’t know we’re out forever or sense any of the time passing.

So basically, what terrifies me is. For example you’re at the ER about to die go into cardiac arrest or something. All those people are there, it’s 2023. Then you go into code and die. And basically from the moment you close your eyes and enter that “eternity of nothing”, you are basically transported across decades, centuries, millenia and even trillions of years forward. All while a moment ago it was 2023 and you were at an ER room and everyone you knew was still alive.

Then a “moment” later it’s trillions of years away and there’s no humans just some very strange robotic world and everyone is dead. All in a matter of seconds as when you die and disconnect from consciousness time takes on a new form. Like for instance if someone who died 1500 years ago woke up in their grave, it wouldn’t feel to them like they were dead for 1500 years but only like they woke up straight away with no time having passed, just like surgery.

It’s fascinating. And horrifying. I don’t want it.",1

1688742125.0,Do any of y’all HATE human beings?,"I despise humans, not just in the classical way of not agreeing on how humanity works which would be just caring about oneself. I feel sad/ hateful towards children since they’re all becoming adults on this day died before turning into adults, but still those little humans have the potential to be savage, violent, aggressive, destructive selfish in the future. I inevitably try not to get hurt by others every day every second of my life does sound stupid, because even the smile even a glance can make me wonder about the others intentions towards me. I don’t believe they’re going to harm me not physically I believe people don’t care about other people it’s just a façade to be worried about other people disappearing, getting kidnapped getting murdered, abducted, etc. What one really cares about is oneself one’s comfort once will Bing and maybe even for their loved ones whatever that means, but that doesn’t mean they’re not interested just in one self with their families and loved ones even. 
I have a partner whom i love and who has complained to me for years that I took away her social life and her friends, and her tries to even go out. I never canceled her the option, the possibility to go out with me. What really happened is telling her that I would prefer not being there while she’s with other people, and in the beginning of the relationship, she somehow preferred in a way to be with me while others were visiting. Maybe i whined about her being my partner and not theirs, hinting that she wanted to spend so much time with others, and i know this js my issue, to feel like she had better reasons to be with other people than being with me despite being someones partner. 
I never got to see this before, i didnt want to cancel or take away her social contact but i guess my social issue and hatred are far stronger than anything on my life. 

I cannot stand being with others and for some reason I could stand being with my partner, but that’s a little far gone in time now I don’t want to lose her because I love her profoundly, but I really cannot stand that. She’s very very social and what I hate the most are people. she loves taking care of messages when they come home. Her family lives abroad so sometimes they may come and are looking for a place to stay for a few days, maybe a week (why cant they get airbb? I would so as not to BOTHER or hassle anyone, i know how uncomfortable is to host a visit so i wouldn’t put that on anyone, plus i take care of my expenses). I hate being a host for visits, I hate sharing my food in my refrigerator. I hate having to pay attention to them, giving them my time and attention for small talk. I DONT CARE WHAT THEY OR ANYONE HAS TO SAY JUST LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY HAS NO SPACE TO BE HEARD. even small chit chat. No time to waste on them, and even tho my life is a waste and a waste of time, I prefer spending it as i want, not as required by social shit. This is why: I don’t think people would be interested in me and people have not showed themselves to be interested in me anytime of their lives like people in general havent, not my parents, not teachers, not partner, so I would very much prefer to keep on doing the same towards others- ignoring them, not caring, hating them. I’m giving them nothing people give to me, like maybe I assume a piece of shit, but so do I assume that people are a piece of shit so if we both are a piece of shit, there’s nothing to do about it like we all agree that we all are a piece of shit and we all can go fuck off. 
I do care for animals though. I feel so identified with dogs. Left alone, abandoned, with zero or no possibilities of something different, unless, someone did something to take the pain away, but then again, if people dont care, why would they have love or anything towards me?

I feel like i need so much love and attention that it’s impossible to ever recover from so much hate.

There are so many things that we as humans cannot understand/comprehend but yet we try to sound so sure of ourselves.

The government confirmed aliens. This dude got on live TV and said these beings are able to come from different dimensions using QM. We don’t even understand consciousness or where it is in the brain. We don’t fully understand quantum mechanics even if we think we do. I am agnostic so no I don’t think that there is “heaven” and “hell” but there are just so many things that we do not have the ability to grasp.

I am not saying there is something after death but I’m for sure not going to completely dismiss it because I realize there is so much we cannot understand right now! And maybe we never will.

We try to convince ourselves that we are meaningless and everything is either meaningless or God’s Will; never accepting our responsibility to create a future we can all survive. 

We are failing evolution to entropy because we prefer to live as psychopathic feral animals rather than be domesticated in Life to fulfill our design in playing out roll in growing and assuring the continuity of Life in perpetuity.

We together form an embryonic Singularity for an embryonic Universe, and we collectively say “Fuck That.” 

We have one evolutionary instruction that makes completing this evolutionary transition automatic and everyone knows it whether they choose to acknowledge it or not; “Be kind and take care of each other.” 
Never yet since Nature evolved us up and we have had the responsibility to create our future have we followed that instruction. 

7000 years of religions, revolutions, and even science, we have never learned to quit using war and slavery to subsidize our lives and luxuries. That’s what will be the cause of human extinction when this pregnancy comes to full term, and this limited trial offer at life concludes. It is up to us to create our future, and it cannot be created through psychopathic behavior. We’re a threat to all life, we choose to live as psychopaths in our sovereign universes, not accepting that “Be kind and take care of each other” is a the only way to achieve resonance and our amplified mind state that allows us to become more than we are. 

“Not until everyone has what they need can anyone achieve their potential.” Professor Nash proved that back in the 50’s.

Say, you have nothing, and absolutely nothing. It's easy to say it is nothing. But, in order for there to be knowledge of nothing, there must be some measurement of it. ""Nothing"" cannot be called Nothing If it doesn't exist.
    
Before the big bang, nothing existed, therefore, nothing did exist. Nothing existed, which probably caused some error of reality and caused to universe to exist.     
      
It kind of reminds me of division by zero. n÷0=x can be rewritten as 0x = n where n is a non-zero value. No number satisfies this equation.    
    
Even if suddenly, in the void of nothing, matter appeared and changed ""0 x 0 = 0"" into 0 x n = 0"" nothing would exist because multiplying anything by zero gives zero. Such a value would have to Defy all logic. Using infinity would show that multiplying infinity by zero gives any nonzero value.

Well anyways, I was thinking about the Christian god and how he is said be in all of us and in everything we do, that connection with others is god and how all the experiences we have are all meaningful since god has a plan for us. Why can he not interact with us or do mystical things or show us that he is really upon us? When is the time in which he will come back to us? Well I think that our universe is simply like a book. It opens, there’s a story with events that is written which has an end, and then it closes. After it’s written it cannot be re-written as it wouldn’t be the same story, and thus why I think that the God of our universe is simply the writer of the story of our universe and thus why he cannot intercept or alter our lives since it is already written. This is why God in the Catholic and Jewish sense is said to be always, in past, in present, and future. God is everywhere since he is the creator, but he wouldn’t change this great book of creation. Since it is a book though, you can read it again at some point, so once our story ends we may just relive this experience again in the future when this book just so happens to be opened again. There are other books though with other authors, which would align with the infinite universe theory as well. Idk but I give credit to the dab I took last night for this, hope y’all enjoy.",1

1703120458.0,The problem with awakening,"The problem when you start awakening to the reality of this world, seeing that none of our actions are actually done by our free will, that everything we do in our lives is constrained by the laws of physics is very disturbing. Knowing that I have no free will, unless I choose to sacrifice myself. But I must do it from an awakening point of view. The most important thing I’m doing lately is not feel emotions for anything at all, good or bad, I try to keep a passive attitude towards life, either good or bad, and the most difficult thing has been to contain my tears when I’ve been very hurt, but somehow I noticed that my life energy was being sucked every time I cried. I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed a similar thing to this awakening because I’m getting the understanding that if I must have free will as I claim to be I must completely set myself free from this world, by my own sacrifice. Anyone else is dealing with this thought?

I decided to write here instead of in the SuicideWatch Reddit because the attitude and the approach is completely different. The end is the same but the way to get to the other is completely different. When I did in the past I was so overwhelmed and in such anxious emotional state that it prevented me from reaching my goal. But now that I’m trying to reach the same goal, be free from this world, although with a complete different mindset, finding peace in my decision, and instead of ending everything impulsively trying to end it being at peace with myself, awakening to the world around me until this reality can no longer hold me because I’m no longer responding to its emotional triggers.

I think if we get to very deep contemplative meditative states we can in fact transcend this limited reality and achieve our goal of being free from the shackles of this world. However, when we act impulsively and try to hurt ourselves, or end our life violently we get exactly the opposite effect because we are emotionally trapping ourselves into this illusory world  and giving it authority over our sovereign self. It may seem counterintuitive but according to the classic oriental teachings this is what they explain about detachment. 

TL;DR If we really want to die then we must detach from this reality by NOT HURTING OURSELVES acting impulsively because SELF-HARM is a TRAP that keep us BONDED to this 3D dimension through OUR EMOTIONS (which are the dark side of the Light/Force)

 (and by dying I mean being limitless and becoming one with the universe, flying like in our dreams never having to return to a physical body limited to the physical laws of reality, returning to the place we were before being born, before we were trapped here)",1
1701817790.0,"My attempt at ""disproving"" solipsism.","Obviously solipsism is an infinite theory that cannot be disproved, no matter how many arguments you make against it, someone will come up and add more to the specific possibility of it. But regardless, here's my attempt.  


Lets look at this from the basics. First of all, I know I exist. Like Descartes said, ""I think, therefore I am."" But how do I know that others exist? What if everyone is just a figment of my imagination?   


Well, we don't know anything, for one. I could be secretly Kanye West under my skin and you wouldnt know unless you skinned me. Which you won't do, because what if I'm not actually Kanye under my skin and I just lied? The same applies to solipsism. You're not gonna run into a grocery store naked and screaming, because what if solipsism isnt true and everyone is just as real as you are? There you go, you don't actually believe in solipsism. That's a good thing to get out of the way first.  


Second, if I'm truly the only person and I created this existence for myself, why am I not a billionaire with gold cars and toilets and women at my service 24/7? Why would I give myself such a boring, basic life where I'm purely just unknown and random to the world? And why can I not control reality, like why can't I just make my crush like me or destroy that building with my mind? If I truly created this world for myself, it doesn't make sense for me to have given myself such a basic and pathetic life. And someone might argue that another God placed me here with fake people, well that alone debunks solipsism because therefore I am not truly alone.  


Third, why do I have such limited understanding of the world? I still don't understand 9th grade algebra. I still dont understand the creation of the universe. I still dont understand conciousness. And theres plenty of smaller things I don't understand, like how touch screens work or how recording works. If I created all of those things, then I think I would be at least somewhat capable of understanding it. But i'm not. And if I was truly some almighty creator who placed myself in a normal life, then I would understand it.  


Fourth, I can make an idea, and then give it to others, and that idea can be improved. That also proves that theres something or someone participating in this reality with me that is capable of improving my ideas. And I can also ask someone to feed me random numbers, and that also proves that people are somewhat capable of thinking things on their own. If you guessed their numbers before they said them, then it would be more plausible. Same thing also goes for math problems, if someone stumps you with a math problem they gave you then they are capable of thinking, and therefore, they are.  


I'll try my best to disprove any arguing comments. This is all the best arguments i've come up with. For any solipsists i hope you get through it soon.",1

Truly my only conclusion is that it's to make this realm into a haven.

If this is a simulation, if it's god's creation..if it's abiogenesis..if it'd anything...the only goal I have come across is to make it into a haven.

If we harm our own bodies it signals pain as if to say no don't do harm...therefore..pain and suffering although unavoidable, is not the answer...so then what is?

It seems to be as kind as best as we can be..because that makes both you and others feel good. Right? 

Perhaps god, ourselves or a simulation, might want us to all go be our best selves.

We all agree hedonism is not the answer..

So if there was an answer...it's that",1
1700199068.0,Testimonies of Christ,"We all heard accounts of witnesses testifying about meeting Christ, near death experiences, blessings bestowed , and miracles healings. Why people do not take these serious is ludacris. For they testify exactly of what happened. The problem is getting caught up in everyday affairs and do not take God seriously. Everyone thinks they know the truth but until you confess your sins and pray for repentance, there is no wisdom in you. For the sinner who repents is more justified in God then the righteous  man. For all you have to do is cast away your pride and pick up the Bible to read and Hear the Words of God. You will earn joy in the Lord, peace that passes understanding, contentment, wisdom, love, decernment, justice, safety of the Lord, if you come to him as a reflection of what Christ did for you.
Who does not want this?

Forgive them for they do not know what they do is the final Words of Christ before he was crucified.
Even in death his love and mercy is why God came down himself to teach us the ways of holiness, love and forgiveness. 

The promise of the Father, The Holy Spirit.
We strive to be Holy like him. The Kingdom is the Holy Spirit and is inside you. Thy Kingdom come and thy will be done. The will of the Father is to believe in the Son. The will of the Son is to share the gospel of Christ, unless you believe in him, you will die in your sins, however if you lift up the Son of Man you will know God and pass thru judgement and have eternal life.

For I will repent for my own servants.
I don't not judge anyone .

For God is a Spirit and is in Me.
If you have seen me, you have seen the Father. 

I AM the Way the Truth and the Life.

For about two months, it wholly occupied my mind and I was completely unable to live a normal life. I was prescribed Prozac, and was able to function pretty normally for a while. I’ve definitely still had anxiety issues, but not nearly as bad. However, now it’s happening again. I’m so scared, these thoughts occupy my mind all day, and they’re making it impossible to live. It feels like I’m physically incapable of experiencing happiness because of this anxiety and dread I feel all day long. To make matters worse I work customer service every day of the week and it’s hard to put on a happy face for everyone. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?

1681826796.0,What is the existentialist position on the antiwork movement?,"I just read a post on r/antiwork that outlined why nobody wanted to work. Essentially, they said there’s nothing to gain from working. Owning a home, raising a family, going on vacation have all become unattainable for the average person. (Average may be a little too strong, but I understand where this sentiment is coming from.) and if you can't get those basics in life, what’s the point of working?

In very rough terms, existentialism is about finding meaning in the meaningless. What’s your take on work?

In my opinion work is any act that produces something of value. And I have an instrumentalist view of what is valuable, so in theory, anything could be valuable to anyone—it’s just a matter of reaching those people. Which means hobbies and passion projects can be considered work. And I think that’s a big thing that they miss. And I think they intentionally disregard the advantages of owning your own business and being self employed, which hobbies and passion projects can lead to if you’re smart about it and stick with it long enough.",1

For some reason, you find out the world is ending in a year. It's an extinction level event, a cataclysm comparable to the sun exploding and it's completely, mathematically unavoidable. And also, you know it's happening in a year. In this scenario you are a respected individual, even scientifically, so if you would come out and reveal this to the rest of the world, after maybe a little bit of resistance at first, they would end up believing you.

What would you do? There is no salvation anyway, even if all the best minds in the world came together they wouldn't be able to produce a solution. It's over.

Would you tell everybody? Would you keep it to yourself and spare the others the same anguish you'd obviously would be feeling upon this revelation? Would you tell only select persons? Would you end your life right away without explanation?

1671777016.0,Existence needs no explanation,"How often do you ask yourself,”how did I get here?” Let me make clear that when I say “here” I do not mean the dimly lit room of a pale puke green hue decorated with sloppily drilled and now barren holes scattered across its four walls that I find myself surrounded by now as I write this.When I say “here”I mean to describe the indescribable and inescapable settings we have perceived since our birth. Not only the observable and physical settings, but the setting in which our consciousness finds itself imprisoned within the medium of the physical realm. It begs the question, in my opinion, of whether or not we “got” here so to speak, or if we’ve been here in some sense all along. 

The most simple, beautiful, terrifying, yet reasonable answer to give when asked what is it like after we die is certainly that it is much like it was before we were born. This rationalization is based on the belief that there was no experience or observations before our birth. But how far back can you really remember? There is most likely much of your early life that you have no recollection of. This means although you certainly did exist, you have no current access to the experiences and observations you made during those early years of your life. In that same sense is it not possible that you have existed in some form before the event of birth and have no current access to the experiences you made beyond what limited span of memory you can reflect on? The only thing we can know for certain is that we exist, and the only thing we have come to learn is that we know little to nothing at all about the nature of our existence. 
People often search for meaning to go along with our disposition of self awareness, although nothing suggests in my opinion that any meaning is necessary to explain how our existence came to be. If you believe in god in a religious sense and that some all knowing supreme entity existed before us and created our reality with human kind as its ultimate objective. Where did god come from and how long and aimlessly did they exist before proposing this occupation? Of what framework did they conceive the image of humanity without a physical form themselves? And if our creation was in their own image, who created the image in which they meant to replicate? By this frame of thought you can understand my confusion that anyone amongst us could believe that any answers offered by religious belief are sufficient in explaining anything at all beyond what we all already know… That all we know is that we are to ask, so do not stop asking why we are at all 🙏☀️🌙🌏",1

Time is not real.  Time is a mental construct. In the psychological sense, time is a schema, it exists only within the mind space. 

Time is not a physical force, it has no properties, you cannot travel backwards or forward through it.  

Everything occuring, has occurred, and ever will occur is happening now, there is only this moment and this moment goes on forever (assumption, I know, but not without precedent or evidence.) 

Every phenomenon revolving around time can be and is explained through observance of the of the physical properties of the universe. 

Einstein's (Poincare's*) theory of relativity, in no way, illustrates the existence of time.  The clocks of the relative objects are, themselves, physical within the conceptual space of the hypothesis.  They are made of the same thing the trains or space-ships or ""x moving object"" is made of.  

For myself, I explain this by positing that the disparity in chronology is due to the kinetic energy of the ""moving"" object  being imparted into the clock,  imparting resistence which the energy of the clock must overcome in order to actuate the mechanism such that it presents the next number. 

Id love to do an expiriment proving this, but I dont have the funds or equipment and thats all secondary to my point, anyway. That point being to remind you all that time is not real, it never was, and never will be.

What sets belief in God apart from belief in any myth? God, being the eternal First Cause, is the cause of all belief in Him. The likes of leprechauns and fairies are beside the point. One who believes in a myth believes in his belief in it, while one who believes in God believes in the cause of his belief.


# With so Much Evil, How is God Good?

To address the problem of evil, it helps to understand what evil even is. Here are some examples of unambiguous evil:

The serial killer derives pleasure from depriving his victims of life.   
The rapist derives pleasure from violating his victims' bodies.   
The controlling sadist derives pleasure from depriving another of his freedom.

All three of these deprive their victims of the means of purpose. So we may conclude evil is manifest in a will against the purpose of things.
If the purpose of all things was ordained by God, then it's nonsensical to say God is evil, that He wills against His own will. Even in considering the possibility of an ""evil God,"" by what means would we know it to be true, that good and evil are defined (since God is the source of all purpose) by adherence or lack thereof to His will? It is perfectly rational to believe God is invariably good, and all evil seen in Him is the result of error and deception.


# All Hope is in God

You might be tempted to say ""I can live a good life on my own."" If not in God, where do you place your hope? What assurance is there in probability, when every die will roll a 6? If you wish to leave behind a legacy for future generations, what is there to ensure no one destroys it? If you wish to live for the thrill of it, what hope do you have after you're gone? If there is a God, wouldn't you take Him over the fleeting speck of a life you otherwise have? I know He's there, not because I wish for it, but because He's revealed a hope for Him that I've always had.",1

So like, a multiverse shouldn’t be “infinite” right? That’s a limited amount of matter given a limited amount of time, thus there should be only a limited amount of ways the matter can interact and change.

Like sure it would be practically “infinite” but not really right?

1648379616.0,consciousness can't be in the brain,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place for this. Has anyone wondered what we are? or where we are inside our bodies? I think most people just assume that we are our brains but I don't think that can be true. we all experience a hallucination of reality which according to our sensory perceptions exist outside our physical bodies. My question is where does this hallucination exist and is that where I am?

It's easy to accept that my eyes and ears our biological cameras and microphones. but in order for me to see and hear what I see and hear wouldn't there need to be biological speakers and a monitor in front of me. Thinking that a bunch of cells got together to form those two things sounds ridiculous to me. we've had a pretty thorough look at the brain and no one has identified a location where all this sensory information is unified. In order for me to see the image I see it has to exist somewhere in physical space right? I don't think the brain can just create it in a non existing zero dimensional place.

It's like I'm playing a really boring first person video game on a computer. my consciousness with a mouse and keyboard controls the avatar my consciousness sees on the monitor. but the game itself isn't taking place in the monitor. all the information i experience and the commands I send using the mouse and keyboard is processed by the computer/brain. as a consciousness I'm not aware at all of the things taking place in the computer to make what I experience a reality. the software that runs on the brain must be a subconscious. for example when i retrieve a memory it's like using a keyword to run a search. a program running in the computer grabs whatever files it thinks is relevant to the keyword. I'm not aware of what neurons are being fired when I try to remember something.

It's just interesting to think about. we've been existing all our lives and countless generations before us have lived and died and we don't even know what or where we are. for all we know we could be at the center of a black hole out in space somewhere and the reality we see is projected onto the inside surface of it. maybe a black hole is our minds eye and whats contained inside of it, our hallucination of reality and our consciousness is what some would call our soul. of course that would require information to travel backwards in time sense black holes can be 10's or 100's of light-years away from earth. which would mean that the moments we're experiencing now wouldn't occur until sometime in the future.",1

Well, if we go to heaven, we get to “live” forever in bliss and happiness and whatnot. But that’s just our own desire, or at least, our body’s desire. And if we go to hell, Satan or whatever gets to punish us for our wrongdoings/sins and stuff. But that’s also just his own desire. And if it isn’t, it’s something else’s desire.

1627381897.0,Did God create the universe in order to escape existence?,"I've been on a journey in the past few months, examining various philosophical, scientific and religious texts. My limited conception of God's purpose with the universe is, basically, to die, or at least, reach an end-state. Without Creation, i.e. a temporal world, God (existence) is pure potentiality. It encompasses every infinite possibility, it is, indeed, Kaos. By launching the Universe into existence, the infinite potential starts to collapse into actuality. 

Quantum mechanics show that everything is basically in a state of pure potentiality until it collapses via observation. But collapsed by what observer? God, I'd say, is the consciousness perceiving it all both in a non-personal manner, as pure awareness, being the entire universe itself, and in a personal manner, synthesising the information that can be gathered within the system. Consciousness is not generated by the brain, it is fundamental - the brain is just the instrument through which consciousness gains a higher-level understanding of itself.

We also know that in nature, everything strives towards a state of enthropy. Our current scientific theory about how the universe will end, is it will just expand out into nothingness until even atoms fall apart. God will be dead, it will be nothing more than pure awareness, with a complete understanding of itself - not its infinite, incomprehensible state, but its actualised, completed state. And isn't that what most religions aim for? The Hindus and Buddhists teach that the final goal of existence is to escape the wheel of existence, and become emptyness. The Christians and Muslims teach that God created the Universe for a purpose, and created Man in his likeness. What this, I think, means, is that God self-reflects through us. God's plan is merely its natural drive to learn everything about itself, and then find an end state where no change occurs anymore.

1684627051.0,When you die your life starts over again from the beginning,"Time has essentially been proven to be non-liner. We live in a deterministic block universe. The only differences between past, present, and future are within the constructs of your mind. There is no such thing as “now” as every point in time is equally real. As such, you’re simply a time-slice which exists eternally and is experiencing a subjective flow of time. Once your conscious is terminated your perception of reality starts from the beginning. The same life you‘ve already lived plays out again. There was never a time when you didn’t exist and they’ll never be a time when you cease to exist, you’re just exist eternally trapped within your own slice of space-time.

I believe this is the only fully coherent view on the nature of existence. The idea that you didn’t exist before you were born and will cease to exist doesn’t make sense. If you only exist for finite amount of time and don’t exist for an infinite amount of time the odds of you existing right now are zero. This model of existence also solves the hard problem of consciousness as it makes conscious experience inherent to the universe in a way that simply slides in with the rest of what we know about space-time without coming up with stuff like ”that chair over there has a certain level of consciousness“.

1631417171.0,The question at the end of the day is whether you believe we're gods or not,"Materialism Vs mysticism 

Materialists believe that everything that exists can be reduced, so therefore can be understood, measured and observable. This is clearly quite falsifiable because everything is usually not fully measurable, observable or understandable before it is even discovered; relativity or the discovery of subatomic particles are clear examples. So it's falsifiable by thumb of time, but let's say one day we can simplify everything. What does that actually make us ?. The answer is gods, mainly because we can actualise (answer every question) the universe above all other species and creatures which inherently become our subjects whilst also proving nothing above us. If aliens beat us to it then they're the gods, but the point is that anything that can reduce the entire universe is a God to anything that can't. To be frank if we had the technological capacity to actualise the entire universe or anything more then we'll be quite close or simply be Gods.

Mysticism is the belief that everything that exists can't be always reduced, so therefore can't be understood, measured or observed in our universe or even existing outside the universe. This isn't necessarily falsifiable because it accepts complexity not simplification. The main reason for that is that it also accepts that even if more things may become more measurable, understandable or observable with time,  that not everything will be reducible. What does this mean ?, it means they'll always be unknown unknowns about the universe or outside the universe and that therefore we can't be gods no matter how close we get. 

So that must mean that if you're a materialists or into mysticism that you're ultimately hinting at the idea that you're will either be a god or not a god.",1

I think the two biggest factors are my genetics (DNA) and my environment. I dont know much about genetics, past basic biology and chemistry and philosophy and psychology, so I am unsure if DNA affects things like brain capacity and IQ. Would everyone act and think very similarly if they were isolated at birth and only knew the same exact artifical envrionemnt that was created to see how intellegence and feelings and imagination works without external factors? 

I think the answer to that question doesnt matter at all actually. The more different it can make a person will just prove my idea more. The other factor, environment, makes me have similar questions. My parents raised me, and to some extent, chose everything I was directly exposed to. I guess it doesnt matter that they are my parents or a random dog I see one day that gives me fear or a star in the night sky that makes me wonder what lies beyond this earth. Once I have all those experiences, and retain memories, each thing happening to me changing me a tiny bit, why is who I am from their anything that I am responsible for. I am not the reason I am the way I am. You can say God doesnt exist but if he does it just makes me all the less special.

Thank you all very much for reading some things that I’ve written.

I’ve received a lot of hateful blowback for expressing my insights in regards to my human experience and it is pretty clear to me now, that this particular subreddit, is not accepting of the thoughts of people like myself.

I have been blown away by the amount of reads I have been graced with and I almost made it to fifty thousand in seven days, and from the bottom of my heart, I thank everyone who has taken the time.

I don’t mention the number of views as a trophy, it is only a measurement of the thanks that I owe to the ones who amassed it.

It gave me some hope. Hope that I may have some value yet.

I’ve been bullied and beaten my entire life. 

I’ve been discouraged whenever I tried to do anything beyond working enough to survive and am always firmly reminded of my place.

The people who have bullied me on here, have hundreds of thousands of Karma points and have banded together more or less to ridicule me and harass me and I don’t even care to fight it. I’m out of my element and just a tourist here.

There is no fight left in me.

I walk out my door everyday, and I’m in a war zone.

I am transgender but not passable enough to not be persecuted.

Last august I was jumped by a gang while waiting for the train to my hrt appointment and they beat me within inches of my life.

I am hurt, I am broken.

I lay awake, questioning my plight
Why am I here, in this endless fight
Against the forces that govern my life?

The stars above shine so bright
But their light seems out of reach
Leaving me alone, in the dark and the night
To face the demons that I cannot breach

The world around me spins
But what is the point in all this?
An existence without any wins
Just an endless cycle of bliss and abyss

The weight of existence heavy on my mind
I am but a tiny part in the grand design
But what is my purpose, what do I hope to find
As I journey through this mortal grind

And as I lay there, in the quiet of the night
I cannot shake this overwhelming plight
That perhaps, there is no meaning or light
And we are all just wandering, lost in the night

It is this stillness that becomes disrupted and it is this disruption that gives your individual experience of consciousness contextual meaning. If we lose track of this stillness, if we begin to have difficulty returning to it, of finding our meaning once more. It is a result of the cacophony of sound within our existence that we lose track of the meaning in our lives. A consistency of motion, a repetition of actions within the chaotic experience of existence, feels reminiscent of this stillness, but it is not stillness. This repetitive predictability in a chaotic existence is a feeling of fluidity, rather than the experience of fluidity itself. For all systems in existence, finding rhythm is their closest experience of stillness. For humans, our.ability to contemplate beyond the confines of existential reality, through awareness, is what allows us to unveil the quietude of stillness. The once laborious constancy of noise whose shadow obscured our existence, may only alleviated when we find the rhythm of stillness beyond our existential experience.

Materialists believe the universe is made of “things” (atoms, elements, chemicals, etc) and that nothing exists beyond the mechanical universe.

Idealists believe that nothing exists outside the mind. The cogito, simulation theory, manifestation, quantum physics, all fall into this category.

This is a very important distinction when it comes to problem-solving. Do we employ medication or therapy? Belief or brute force? Usually a combo works best.

If the double slit experiment indicates light is a wave and a particle, why can’t reality be both, existing simultaneously, and harmoniously? Why can’t the universe be somehow material AND mind? What if material objects obey their own laws and mind follows its own?

Bad equal punishment.

In 2 both dies.

1681241644.0,The Little Seed,"The Little Seed

   Betty June loved all her flowers with all her heart and that love did not stop at the seeds. 

Betty June knew that each one of the seeds had a special gift stored inside and she was overjoyed to see the gifts they gave each time one would grow.

   In Betty's flower shop, it was considered cruel to keep seeds within pouches to sell to the customers. 

Instead, they were contained within clear jars, so they may gaze in wonder about  the flower shop at all the plants that used to be little seeds just like they were. 

    Jeb was especially eager to grow as soon as possible. 

As far back as he could remember, he had always desired to become a rose. 

He was not like most other seeds in the jar who had not figured out what they wanted to become yet. 

Jeb wondered how the other seeds could have any doubt about what they should become in adulthood. 

Roses were beautiful and cherished as gifts of affection from lover to lover. 

Roses also had thorns which could prick those who we’re not delicate enough to revere their beauty.

The goal for Jeb was to be chosen as a flower that would certainly be gifted to someone to show affection. 

Jeb considered that life would be easy for him, seeing as he already had the answers to his future, or at least an idea of what he will become.

One day a man came to Debbie’s shop and purchased a handful of seeds from Jeb’s jar. 

Jeb was one of the lucky ones to get picked. 

He squealed with joy the entire ride to his new home where he would turn into a beautiful Rose.

 Jeb was given his own pot with rich soil. 

The other seeds from Jeb’s jar were in the garden too - each having their own pot to grow in.

Jeb joined the conversation his neighbors were having around him and soon found himself bragging about how quickly he would turn into the most wonderful shade of red they had ever seen. 

One neighbor expressed that he could not understand why Jeb wanted to be a rose so bad.

Another seed told Jeb that he doubted that anyone of them would turn into a rose at all, nor did they want to.

They went on to say that it would be embarrassing having to deal with all the attention that roses generate.

  A few weeks passed and one morning Jeb noticed that nearly all the other pots in the garden  had budded.

Little green leaves could be seen on the tops of all the pots surrounding Jeb. 

This worried Jeb deeply.

Why had he not started to grow yet? 

He was exhausted from trying so 
hard to grow each day. 

He would stay up at night later than the others and stare at the moon, hoping it would help him grow.

A few months passed and now it was clear to Jeb that the other seeds were turning into blackberry bushes. 

Every one of them had begun to produce their first berries. 

 Jeb was not a berry bush. He knew that. How could he possibly become something that did not even have a flower? Sure, they had thorns like roses, and that was sort-of appealing to Jeb, but it was simply not what he wanted to be all in all.

 A year passed and Jeb had not grown into anything.

Jen hadn’t given up on becoming a rose and knew he never would. 

This thought scared him. 

If all he wanted to become was something that he could not be, then would he turn out to be nothing at all? 

He would even settle for becoming a blackberry bush - Sure, they were not adored such as roses and no lover would ever give one as a gift, but they sort of looked like Roses and at this point it was about survival for Jeb. 

Jeb pictured all the other flowers besides Rose’s that he used to see at the flower shop. 

He tried with all his will to grow into a morning glory for a few days and then after that decided that he was to flower into a daffodil and the phase lasted for a few weeks. 

He even tried to talk to the bushes about his new identities as various flowers and pretended to have as much enthusiasm about being a lilac as he had shared about becoming a rose. 

The bushes ignored the tiny sound coming from their former peer and around that time, most of the bushes had resolved to flat out ignore Jeb when he spoke. 

The man who’s garden they lived in came out one day and picked the season’s wealth of berries from the bushes around Jeb and the bushes were all very pleased that their fruits were being so thoroughly enjoyed. 

Finally, the man came out to the garden again one day and looked down into Jeb’s pot. 


He grabbed Jeb and placed him in a tiny jar and put the jar in his car. 

Jeb was nervous at first but soon ecstatic to be in Betty June's flower shop once again.

The man complained to Betty that this seed had not grown into a bush. 

Debbie exchanged Jeb for another seed. 

Jeb could not return to the jar with the other seeds, he knew that. 

He was too old and didn’t grow. 

Jeb was certain that he was to be thrown into the trash. 

Jeb look about at the Roses that he grew up admiring within the flower shop and he wept. 

 


Betty June loved her seeds far too much to just throw Jeb in the trash. 

She tried a few different mixtures of soil and exposed Jeb to different amounts of lights each day. 

Jeb sat in his new pot and thought to himself that Debbie was sure to give up trying to make him grow, but sure enough, suddenly Jeb began to sprout little green leaves. 

Within a month, Jeb was a full-grown Marigold.

Betty said to herself that he was the most beautiful Marigold she had ever grown.

A young man came into the shop shortly after Jeb had grown and asked for the most beautiful flower he could buy for his wife. 

Betty didn’t need any time to decide which one to send the man home with. 

The man agreed with Betty that Jeb was certainly the most beautiful flower he had ever seen.",1

so as for what i intended to say was something that i feel constantly, that of wich is not misanthropy and neither philantropy (philos+antropy), but simply this agonising implication that i as a conscious being, my only reference to what means to be human in a non-cultural aproach and subjective/ontological level, am i weird? is it justified to me to feel the absolute pressure of being pré-destined to the stupidity that is so common among all of us, our pride, ego to simply not accept so many things as we are reduced to animals by our own nature. you may be reading this but what are you reading? technically speaking this can only be a mirror of your own understanding of your own perceptual reality, so how do you deal with the facts of wich is that there is so much pain brought by something that violates our current means to understand the universe trough empirical/deductive and inductive evidence?.

what can be done for us to be more wise? if i say that as a human and a vessel for the imortality of ideas that will eventualy exist as long as something with a human brains lives, if my thought in that, so superficial, so childish in it's simplicity and in its ingenuity, how can there be no one ever thought of that? then why did it failed? or did it even failed? i don't know, i don't know, i don't know?

as said in this exemple:i feel that my humanity as human being shared by others that seem soo diferent of mee scares me if i am pre-destined to becoming so emotional, dependable and hatefuly ignorant of knolwedge that for it's own act of existence shows itself as being able to do so, it's tiring and terrorific that my ""liberty"" is being indangered by reality itself, more even to the fact that those who should be able to give me the assistence to survive in such a weird and absurd condition that is existence seem absent of that that should be the most obvious thing, that reality it's self in it's amorality is the most imoral thing that exists and gives so little to take so much.

yes this is a rant and i am trying to express something that can be seen as paranoic so please do not define me or quantify me as something that don't deserve respect, reject your solipcistic attitude and see me in a more qualitative manner rather than a quatifiable one. Thank you.",1
1670600605.0,"A pessimistic perspective, but with hope in the end","&#x200B;

I am an absurdist, and believes that  life absolutely has no meaning. Whether we attribute meaning doesn't  matter, but why not. But i don't believe Sisyphus was happy. He just had  purpose, which makes the pain worth it. The only reason we want a  meaning to it all is because we want to create a reason for all this  suffering. When your remove this meaning nothing but pain without  purpose persists.

&#x200B;

 The lion wo eats it's prey produce so much more suffering to the other  animal than it personally gets from it's small delight of relieving its  hunger... I really understand when Schopenhauer said, that we live in a  prison of pain, and lifes meaning is all about easing the pain. We are  creatures bound to constant suffering... Existing is a curse of the  universe. I sometimes feel like the best way to escape this prison of  suffering is psychoactive substances. They relieve the pain, but when it's gone, we are  bound to suffer yet again... The pain in the world is masked by our fake  smile, and our inability to see other peoples suffering... 

The universe is  indifferent to our existence. It doesn't care, but we do. I aspire to be  happy. But to do so i must neglect the pain that is bound to our human  experience. Thats why painkillers are so wonderful. They ease the pain, and  that is so euphoric because it's a relief from the pain of existing. We  need this pain though, because it's what drives us to something better.  Doing painkillers all the time isn't productive in the sense that you become  content. Not striving towards goals that relieve the suffering in the long term... But i  believe we can become truly happy. But that would require that we remove  our desires and live like monks. Thats the only way to be truly free.  But if you pick another route and still choses to be bound by needs, you can choose LOVE

Love  is the natural antidote to some of the pain. It's a wonderful feeling.  It's the only natural feeling, along with sexual pleasure that even can  exceed what you can ever have on psychoactive substances. If you are lucky, and find a  wonderful woman that also likes you, life can be infinitely more  pleasurable. That is what we can strive for. Becoming the best version  of ourself, so we can find love, and admiration...

But  love can also absolutely devastate you, when your heart breaks. But  then you can aspire to become even better. This is a good way to live  the ideal life. It can be done, but it requires that you use the  pain productively. You need to feel the pain, and use it against itself.  Love can absolutely relieve some of the suffering, and give life more meaning than anything else.",1

But the Webb is 100 times stronger than the Hubble and I'm bracing myself for the wave of meaninglessness that will likely overcome me. But also very excited to see the image...

Apparently, some in the existential nihilism school of thought suggest the study of metaphysics/astronomy are simply the result of human fear of death. Is it true? Are governments spending two decades on developing and sending $10bn gadgets up into the stars because we are all so subconsciously desperate to understand why we are here/what the point is? 

We've evolved to have consciousness which in turn makes us question our existence... and is it merely this dwelling on the question of our existence which has fuelled all these developments in science? But with each answer we only get more questions and mysteries (ie, dark matter and dark energy) so will we ever stop searching? Or is better just to accept meaninglessness... guess that means the solution to existential nihilism is a state of indifference, apathy, 'freedom from passions'? Letting go can be a good thing but can you let go too much? Is this practice of letting go and reaching a 'stoic state' simply training ourselves to return to our primitive brains? The primitive brains which are free from the consciousness that plagues (enlightens?) us with these questions of existence and meaning that prevent us from simply just 'existing'?

But then... could this apathy rob us of finding that meaning (for those who believe the meaning of life is the one which we create for ourselves)? Or could this apathy rob us of the motivation to embark on these scientific endeavours and, in turn, the possibility that one day we WILL in fact have all the answers?

Gosh, the study of time and space is always so important and cool but seems so futile when you consider the fact that why we even care may be rooted in a desperate search for an answer to why the heck we are all here.

Then I discovered symbolic logic, which converts words and statements to algebra! The horror. But I soon realized that the purity found in proving the validity of a thought abstractly was clarifying and gave me a glimpse of the metaphysical reality of logic, that it was an essential ingredient in the search for truth and meaning. 

Logic is a language that is beyond emotion. It's mathematical precision makes no allowances for any judgment based in human intuition, which is chaotic and is rooted in the subjective and varied experiences that influence how and what conclusions are reached.

Logic has no such variation. 1000 people would necessarily arrive at the same conclusion, given the same argument. It is the pure reason of which Kant spoke. Logic is beautiful, harmonious and a fundamental  element of a sentient life.

Logic gives an argument clarity and structure.  It allows a thinker to clearly outline their idea, introduce  their proof in such a way as to evolve an idea into a coherent system of thought.

Understanding the meaning of one's life and finding the truth of their existence does demand the generous application of intuition, subjective conclusions and in these cases, logic still rides along,  stealthily though, hiding under a blanket in the back.

Living in and of oneself requires the discipline to ruthlessly strip away the myths surrounding fate, destiny and most importantly, the concept of a reward given for living with pain, sorrow and deprivation. 

To see the cracks in the faulty moorings tethering an unquestioning mind to the fallacies of reward and punishment doled out by the ultimate neglectful parent through the appearance of trauma or joy in one's life. A life that is alternately wondrous and awful, or for too many, a sequence of misery heaped upon pain topped with cruelty and injustice. 

We experience pain for no reason. Ever impartial, pain that spares none. Seeking meaning in misfortune is foolish and ultimately harms the existence of a being. When hardship is treated with the significance that is given to say, stubbing a toe, the easier it is to move forward through the pain striving to live with intention. 

Without logic,  the feelings reign supreme. The meaning of life to one is forgotten when one exists simply as pain. Reason is what drags you relentlessly out of your enslavement,  demanding that the value inherent in your essential being be celebrated and given the chance to fly.

Logic proves the validity of existential thought, and without it, ""things fall apart, the centre cannot hold.""*

The avoidance of contradiction by SCIENTISTS:Mathematicians DoubleThink

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink

Doublethink is a process of indoctrination whereby the subject is expected to simultaneously accept two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in contravention to one's own memories or sense of reality.

EXAMPLE

you know 0.9999... (the 9s dont stop) is a infinite decimal thus non-integer by notation

you know 1 is an integer

yet you also believe

you say

1=0.9999...

without contradiction

because now you say

0.999... is now an integer

here is the doublethink

1 integer = 0.9999... non-integer infinite decimal

ie

an integer is /=a non-integer

which is a contradiction in terms -which your doublethink does not see

thus

maths ends in contradiction

The antelope also knew of Greek philosophy. One day the antelope was munching some grass when it spotted a cheetah running towards it. The antelope knew well the cheetah could run faster than antelopes, and in its case knowledge had overridden instinct, so it was not as motivated to run its fastest as would an unintelligent antelope. No matter, it thought, I will run away at reasonable speed, for when the cheetah reaches where I am now, I will have moved on, and so on. The antelope was aware of the paradox of Zeno, The Tortoise and the Hare. The cheetah soon caught and ate the antelope.

1586760686.0,"Descartes was wrong about Cogito, ergo sum","
Descartes was wrong, there is no psychological entity with an identity. He only chose to think that.

It is only the artificial ego that suffers. The man who has transcended his false “me” no longer identifies himself with his suffering.

Outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of choice indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness – the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict.

For true choicelessness to be realized, choice – implicit or explicit – has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, this ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but I’m implying the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or self as a psychological entity.

Such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: identity is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention. Therefore, choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called ""observation without the observer""

Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.

One of my biggest Values that I would like to harness is truth and listening to my concience athough its not the standard concience that other people attend to it s different than that, in short doing the most sensible things in my knowledge. My problem is tied with that, and Because of it i am not moving forward and i am suffering miserably without any goals. Therfore I don t have values or a healthy ego aka right now i am a completly nihilist by definition.The problem is in the deepness of my thinking. I am unable to chose a goal right now Because any serious goal (Career and job in particular) that has a slightest impact on anyone i regard immoral. Let me explain. For example i am interested in game development. I know of gaming addiction and also hold a believe that unnecessary pleasure is more negative than positive for an average person in todays society. Working for anybody else aka being employed by someone is immoral for me Because i have to do things which someone else Wants not ME and and that is meaningless if we don t have exctly the same vision about the meaning of a company. So that s about 95 % of the Jobs. And Jobs that I think Are genuinly good like being a medical scientist I am not interested in. I also suffer from a kind of arogance and couldn t be working a good job that i love doing if i consider it Below me like a teacher. I think i can contribute more than that. I know That if i don t decide to pick something i will be slapped in the face by the a reality check and will End up working in mc donalds.

1419436916.0,"ATTENTION, ATTENTION: Your Existence Is Irrational","Let me be the first one to say that, what I’m about to say, I’m not the first one to say. Countless others from philosophers and poets, kings to shepherds, and freemen to prisoners, all have reached one singular grave and paralyzing conclusion: this life is meaningless. There’s nothing new about that statement, nothing groundbreaking, nothing Nobel-prize winning.

So how do I know this? Where does this meaninglessness come from? The temporal significance of all that we are and of all that we do. Your life’s significance is a function of time. I don’t care if you’re Alexander the Great, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Saget, or Joseph of Arimathea, with enough time transpired all that you’ve done, all your hopes, aspirations and efforts will amount to ultimately nothing. Humanity is but a temporary moment in the cosmos. The time will come when either nature annihilates us or we destroy ourselves. Either way we’re done for. It is simply just a matter of time until it will be as if we were never here. Again, there’s nothing new about this, although most folks choose to ignore this pervasive fact and bury their heads in the sand.

Furthermore, not only is humanity a temporary institution on the macro level, but the very individuals that constitute humanity are temporary beings as well. As you read this recognize that the very feelings of consciousness which enable you to perceive the words in front of you and serve as the common denominator for all that you experience is a temporary phenomenon. There will soon be a day when you don’t “you” anymore.

“Very well then,” says the nihilist. “What’s wrong with that?” Agreed. Some may find comfort in their temporality, even going so far as to utilize it as a reminder not to become too engrossed in the requirements of day-to-day life. The problem arises for me when one must rationalize the suffering that day-to-day life requires. “Suffering? What suffering? Your hunter-gatherer ancestors endured suffering. What could you possibly qualify as suffering in your day-to-day experience?” Again, I agree. When one thinks of suffering the first thoughts to come to mind aren’t exactly the nine-to-five, 40 to 50 hour work week that many of us exemplify. But what is a life in its entirety aside from a spectrum of highs and lows? A roller coaster if you will, with a majority of its time spent somewhere in the middle. I think it would be fair to say that most of one’s life is spent steeped in mediocrity, not overtly pleasurable but also not necessarily painful. Now consider for the moment the fact that we are purpose driven creatures and juxtapose that with the aforementioned proposition that this life is meaningless. What possible rationale can one conjure to persist through this mediocre existence?

Recognizing the ultimate temporality of all that we do whether internally (via consciousness) or externally (via humanity) we can conclude that our existence is ultimately meaningless and that the suffering that one must endure to exist is irrational. Knowing this, what shall we do? Persist through an existence that we fool ourselves into thinking is significant? Toss ourselves off a cliff? Join the Seminary? To be honest, there is nothing you can do. The consciousness that serves as the basis for your being will soon enough cease to be. The body in which your consciousness resides will one day return to the earth. And the earth to which your body returns will one day turn to cosmic ash, taking with it all that was ever human. An ancient Persian king once asked a collection of wise men to formulate a mantra which would always be applicable and in all ways true. After much deliberation the wise men could return but one: “And This Too Shall Pass.”

TL;DR: ""Recognizing the ultimate temporality of all that we do whether internally (via consciousness) or externally (via humanity) we can conclude that our existence is ultimately meaningless and that the suffering that one must endure to exist is irrational.""",1

But still, why use emotions on people? People often use their emotions when they find that they're logic isn't good enough, as if emotion is a secret magical source or something.

If we just extrapolate technology, and add up how far we've gotten in such a short amount of time, then think how far a civilisation could reach if it's millions or billions years old?

we ARE living in a simulation, it's the great filter to determine if you are good or bad... what we perceive as ""life' is only ""growing up"" outside of this universe.

When we were born, our first journey started.. we were reborn... Multiverse, it's all connected; the dreams we have, are just our experiences in the other universae. I've been killed in another universe, i've dreamed it, seen it, felt it; but i'm still alive in this one.

and YES the universe we know, that's a CREATION, but not by god, but by our parents and their parents... the universe is there to create a world where it's possible to insert our consciousness into a being, then analyze it's behavior, and see how it went.. BAD people? They don't go to ""heaven"", which is just the next level actually.

Our universe is too numerical, nature is too obviously mathematical; this is created, by ourselves..   
We don't have a clue how long (nor do i) how long we actually live... 75 years in this universe could be like 1 month in the ""outer reality"", who knows... We have no clue as we only see and live in a 3-dimensional plane where light dictates the speed at about 300 thousand km/sec, and time is based on this speed, and it's one-directional..

For all we know, we could be ""4-dimensional beings, which could change time"" ... Your whole life, that's the test, to decide if you can go on to the next round... Some people will ge back and forth through life, get reborn because it wasn't clear enough, others only have to go through 'our life' once... 

I'm not saying this is THE truth, but after having lived 43 years on this rocky planet, those are my conclusions, and yeah, i have had a hard life with many many experiences. I was dealt a bad hand at the start, got debuffed a few times, but i've learned and accepted who, what and why everything is like it is. Would i trade with someone else? Nope, never..my experiences make me who I am and if people will say I'm totally crazy after posting this, so be it. That your good right to do so....

I know you the reader, knows absolutely nothing about me. But these are the thoughts that race in my head continuously. And I feel like writing them down. I want to explain how I feel, what I think, and hopefully find peace, true peace of mind.

I know theres stuff like therapy, which I do not have the means to go and do, that’s why I am here. Talking in a mess of OCD rantings. 

Anyways, do you know what is a weird? Getting thoughts or feelings that feel, well, weird, thoughts that you can’t really explain properly, but the thought is just so intense or off putting.  Is that just me? Like an example is the thought of being alive, me, you, a sentient being in an unknown universe, full of unknowing possibilities. And that thought that all that keeps me here to experience this is my heart pumping blood throughout my body to my brain, that thought to me is scary, it is insane to me. It makes me feel insecure, like I have no control over myself and everything that happens in my life. I know that’s OCD probably, and anxiety as well, the unwillingness to accept uncertainty. These should be natural thoughts, but I keep them pent up in my head, like a tense ball of energy. I am a tense ball of energy. I don’t like to be so existential all of the time about everything, but I am, and I can control the thoughts I get, so why not write them down? It feels so terrifying thinking about all of these crazy uncertainties. Its like I see something others don’t, why me? Am I cursed? Or is it a gift I haven’t seen yet. Because I truly love this life, there’s so many cool things out there in this universe I want to experience and see. People, animals, environments, the earth, stars, moons, the universe. Where am I in all of this, stuck in my room contemplating if I am insane (I most certainly am). But this feels good, talking about the thoughts. 

I still feel stuck in my life, like I don’t know where its going, like purgatory, am I a bird trapped in a cage? Or am I a bird that’s sitting in the cage with the door unlocked but that’s too scared to check if I can be free? I guess we will have to see who releases me from my cage.

I, like many of you, have been inadvertently placed on this cumrag of a planet to be a clockwork wage slave. The consequence of my existence is just that: to serve as a means of achieving what is not mine. A paycheck, as rewarding as it may seem to some, is not something to be proud of, for any set amount of newly displayed digits that appear on your checking account are to only be allocated for the sake of monetized survival. Humans have essentially monetized everything in existence, including your very own existence. Water, which is found nearly everywhere, still comes at a cost. Air conditioning, which is fundamental to one’s health, comes at a cost. Health itself comes at a cost, and at a big personal expense at that. Sanity comes at a cost. What I find to be incredibly fascinating is that the preponderance of human beings, regardless of menial occupation (however, heedful of pay rate, workload, and status), can and must work five to six days a week to make ends meet, with only a mere day or so off, while of course still failing to make ends meet.

We were not taught money in school because the government does not want us all to be rich. The majority of the work undergone by those who frequent this subreddit seems to be menial jobs; regardless, it is devoid of anything positive, and understandably so. The feelings of helplessness naturally intensify when one goes about working their menial job, and observes their bosses or “leaders” nonchalantly going about their day not suffering one bit; as the subordinates {the menial worker} of the said individual/s in ‘power’ {i.e., bosses}, stress in anguish as they are yelled at or disrespected constantly by customers, guests, and even the said bosses, who trivialize the menial worker's existence so that expectations can be met at the expense of inhumane suffering. Ironically, the menial worker's, or subordinates, financial expectations are almost never met. Conversely, if a menial worker is having a bad day on a Monday, or any day for that matter, how is that said individual supposed to get through the next day, all the way up until maybe that Friday, or even Saturday— in a sane, fair-minded way without the usage of pharmaceuticals, without self-harm, and without resorting to violence? Because conformity is an essential byproduct of monetized survival, wage slaves, such as myself, must suppress our natural human instincts in the face of adversity due to the consequential prospects of employment termination and the elimination of income. In other words, we have been conditioned since grade school to be robotic in nature to serve these purposes, and I have finally opened my eyes.

To my belief, capitalism is chiefly responsible for all of this, to an extent. Although, socialism was created in response to capitalism, I personally believe that even if the economic climates were to have been swapped, humans, especially those in power, would still find ways to manipulate, abuse, and screw over us helpless, brainwashed, conditioned, and frustrated individuals. Conformity, at least in my eyes, is synonymous with tolerance. By collectively conforming to this evil system as a whole, we are therefore tolerating the system as it is. However, the only effective means of action for any of this is through force, which is seen in the eyes of the rich as evil; moral hypocrites. Socioeconomic disparity, as a term, is seen as nonexistent in the eyes of those in power. Furthermore, those in power who express “suffering” do not in fact suffer, regardless of micro-, managers, leaders}, or macro-classifications of power {CEOs}. “Suffering” expressed and “felt” by those in power is subjective; suffering felt by those outside of that spectrum is objective. To conclude, one day, the sun will set, and the torches will be lit. Us young individuals will become powerful in the height of our uniforms made red.",1

With that in mind, I’ve convinced myself that there’s a higher power even though I’ve been a raging atheist all of my life. So basically, every person is unique, and we all do everything in really specific ways. Everything we do is based off of who we are; the way we present ourselves, the way we talk, the way we think. Even really specific things like the way we sit, or our body language is very unique and specific. For example, the way I sit in a chair, the way I walk or even my blinking patterns are unique to me. It’s almost predictable, as if it’s not actually free will, more so that I’m being controlled (if that makes any sense). I feel like I’m in a simulation being controlled by a higher power.

WE HAVE TO:

 Create an original piece of art that visually conveys your poem.and reflect an artistic style between 1910-1950
  2D or 3D Art: Create a thought-provoking, unique work of art that reflects the principles of existentialism.  2D Art (i.e. painting): maximum size 11”x17”, framed, museum/gallery quality presentation.  May not use clip art.  May use limited download images, but the work must include substantial personal artistic activity – this does not mean PhotoShop!
  3D Art (i.e. a model or sculpture): maximum size 24”x24”, with a platform/base or backdrop.  Art must exhibit complexity of thought, creative use of materials, clean execution and craftsmanship.  You may use any materials you wish, but remember to analyze the principles of existentialism.  Though framing obviously will not make an “average” piece of work “superior,” careful presentation does matter.  If you do a collage the pictures must cover all the space and be an interesting shape; it must be extraordinarily meaningful, not just a list of concepts.



Except there's one problem, I suck at art. I'm not a very artsy person so I asked my teacher and he told me about Alexander Callder's mobiles. Can someone tell me how hard it would be to incorporate 7 principles in a mobile, and whether another project would be better?

1703878641.0,"Birthdays Make Life Feel More Absurd than Usual, Why Am I Still Here at 24?","Turned 24 today and I've found myself from last night and waking up this morning to now in almost a constant state of laughter about how absurd this all is. 

It started in the shower last night enjoying scrubbing my head with shampoo and the hot water running down my body and just thought to myself that I'm happy to be in a hot shower and to have made it to 24. But then in great absurdist fashion I found myself thinking at any moment a freak accident could occur, that it's possible shampoo could come running down into my eye, I could freak out, slip, fall, and break my neck and die. And I think in the past before I started thinking about philosophies like existentialism and absurdism this thought would've made me paranoid, but instead I couldn't stop myself from giggling about it.

I think the giggling turned into a general laughing about why have I made it to 24 and how absurd it is that I'm still here when I currently have no real goal or movement towards something greater than my current life. And also how absurd it is that many people who did have aspirations centered around a greater goal or movement are no longer with us.

You hear stories all the time of honor roll college students or teenagers with huge aspirations being victim to freak accidents or crime or violence. You hear stories of people who are in roles or were wishing to become occupations like doctors, lawyers, scientists, et cetera dying tragic deaths. You hear or watch stories of children dying due to wars or child labor across the world. All people with a ton of potential towards the ""greater good"" of the world, people who are hard workers. 

And then I think about myself. I will preface it with I have worked hard for many things and had many goals accomplished. I did very good in grade school and got into a great university. I busted my ass working through college and with my full time job afterwards to be able to afford a house and set myself up for a decent life. However this year, now that this is all done, I've realized that these were essentially all of the goals I had. In addition to this I also feel like I've felt everything I've always wanted to whether it was love or accomplishment or ecstasy, so I'm just sort of lost.

So I think this birthday has settled in me that I'm just quite ambivalent towards life currently and I'm finding the conflict of it absurd. On one hand I'm enjoying how inconsequential my life feels now, but on the other there is a bit of guiltiness as to being on this Earth and knowing how consequential life can be if you work hard for it, but I don't wish to work hard anymore, so why essentially am I still here?

Have you ever felt what it's like to have your entire essence and sense of being dissolve? I'll try to explain this to the best of my ability. Imagine this scene. You're laying on a patch of grass, you can feel the cool grass blades against your skin as you lay there, unmoving. As you relax and dive deep into your mind you no longer feel as yourselve. You're now the grass beneath you, the wind that blows, the leafs that gently rustle against one another... You feel connected to everything around you.. In that state I lose sense of reality and completely dissolve in feelings, shapes and forms that I have a hard time describing with my concious mind. The feeling of freedom, pure bliss, happiness and content is indescribable. I no longer feel as a separate particle, as a meaningless cog in a stupid machine, but as one with everything around me. The equilibrium I experience in that state is... I think I can compare that feeling to smoking weed, I guess. The best weed you can find, for a long period of time.

What I find hard to cope with is coming back from that state into this fucked reality that I must abide by. How do you cope with all this?

 I cannot enter that state if there are people near me, it is like their desperate attempts to shun the voice in their heads away prevents me from connecting with everything around me. As if they disturb my balance, jam my signal, my connection. The majority of time when around people I must remain hidden behind several masks to preserve myself, because I am able to, sadly, understand them on a very deep level. It is like their entire personality, problems, motives for acting the way they do. Everything. Is laid out bare for me to observe. Where the hatred and resentment of people might come from, why they feel that way, what made them lash out at that exact moment. By just looking at people's facial features I can discern the majority of their personality.  It is quite sad, because often I would try to understand people and show them that there's an easy way to feel at peace and be at balance with everything around you. You just have to remove all the jammers, to truly listen and to dissolve.

But the real problem comes there. Once you feel that feeling, that there is something beyond what we can comprehend as human beings, beyond what I could ever understand at this level of existence. How am I meant not to be suicidal when the prospect of death opens an indescribable amount of unkowns and it excites me so much...?

>God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?

\-Friedrich Nietzsche

Nothing could be a deeper embrace of the absence of God than to outsource the creativity and expression of human experience to a machine. Nothing could be a deeper declaration that the output matters above the origin, that the arrival, not the journey is what matters.

My general intuition with this, aside from obvious copyright issues (which, in my mind, there's a legal case against the use of these tools on copyrighted works, i.e. its literally using people's art as tooling in an engineered system), is that AI art will be a psychological weapon of mass destruction. It is going to deeply challenge people's belief in and understanding of meaning itself, at scale. It will numb people to the beauty of art, when they can get so much novel art at the click of a button. And, when one is so numb to beauty, they will also be numb to the meaning that such beauty confers.

There's always been this underlying sacred sensibility about art, regardless of whether or not you're the most devout Catholic or total atheists. I.e. lots of nonbelievers absolutely adore the music of Bach, and find that the music to be like a beautiful reflection of the structure of the universe. But, it also represents a connection to a person when listening to such work.

When that connection is removed, it's going to mess with people's heads in a very fundamental way.

Meaning itself (or the sense of it, depending on your belief) is where the drive to actualize oneself through good works is derived; when such meaning is removed, the highest thing one has to actualize to is power.

1631344340.0,Why determinism is an illusion. An Existentialist foolish attempt...,"Can I first thank those who have engaged in this topic and apologise to any who I have offended. However this is an “Existentialist” sub, and one feature of this is the idea of Freedom. That for humans existence precedes essence. That there is no essence, purpose pre given to human life.  We are terribly free. Many posters have argued that we are determined therefore not free, do not have free will, are in effect pre-programmed automatons.

Determinism is an illusion because it is untenable.  I think I can produce an argument for this.

A deterministic system produces determined objects. 

Example, an Automobile factory or factory making computer processors. The aim would be that each item produced should be identical. In perfect factory they would be. Glitches, errors mean that some items will be faulty. A fault meaning not as determined to function.

Look at the world we see diversity. We see change, things come into being and pass away. From species to individuals. How can a deterministic system produce change? Novelty. Well it could be determined to do so. But in a determined system the outcome is determined.  To get novelty it would need to introduce indeterminacy. QED It is not a determined system. Someone can come up with new ideas, new species evolve... etc.  In the case of Humans – we can think up new stuff- are free to do so. 

This might for some be tough -  and so they resort to determinacy. Problem with freedom solved. For existentialists this is bad faith.  

Trying to keep it short.

One other point – which Bertrand Russell couldn't refute. If everything is determined by a causal chain, everything has a cause, how does this get going?  There must be a un caused first cause. Not determined. There are other points arising from this, which I will leave out, I've probably already annoyed some, for which I'm sorry. 

Addendum.

Someone pointed out that randomness would account for  indeterminacy, but that doesn't seem like free will. Others that the world is essentially chaos, contingent.  And that doesn't seem like free will.
Those who believe in evolution see random mutation as responsible for life, not determination. It follows that this produces humans who are intelligent. Intelligent to the extent in extremes of figuring this out, and of other stuff. Great Art, Science, etc. If  evolution by random mutation can produce consciousness, and consciousness new theories, works of art, philosophies, a degree of freedom (from convention) is required.

1704119440.0,The fact of experience is the only complete truth.,"I'm curious what existentialism says about this.

An axiom is a presupposed, given truth. It is not proven, it is assumed to be true for the proceeding endeavor, such as logical reasoning.

The existence of physical reality is predicated on the axiom that it exists. We cannot prove that it exists. We assume that it does. 

All that we know, is that we experience. We assume that just because we have a map, that there is a territory.

Scientific observation requires experience. Measuring equipment is observed.

Experience is not reliable. Therefore, the scientific method is not, in all intellectual honesty, reliable.

Is the scientific method useful? In that paradigm, yes.

But in terms of pure logical honesty, it is axiomatic.

Assuming that our experience is reliable, physical reality is real.

But our experience is not reliable.

1701892597.0,Losing My Mind Over Many Worlds Theory. Is there any way out?,"Hello everyone,

Posted this in [r/AskPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/) and [r/QuantumPhysics](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumPhysics/). They told me that this is more of a philosophical than a physical question. So I post it here now.

I  am going crazy because of Quantum Physics. According to my limited  understanding of quantum mechanics there are theories out there that  state that in our ""reality"" every possible branch that could exist  actually exists. Of course this is meant on a particle level but with  enough branching it would also translate into our daily life.

If  that is true, would that not mean that there is absolutely no reality  to anything? My girlfriend or mother have no character. I just happen to  be in a universe or reality where they behave in a certain way. They  are not actually in any way. There is an infinite number of realities  where they are slightly different or completely different. Nothing at  all is in any sense ""real"". It is just a version that I happen to land  in. Same goes for myself. I am just whatever randomly happens. Why would  I even care about anything then? Why would I try to help people? Why  achieve anything? There are realities in which it happens and those in  which it doesn't. Also, there are realities in which people are tortured  in eternity.

What's scaring me even more is communities like [r/NevilleGoddard](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/),  where people use this ""knowledge"" to shift realities based on their  desires. They have this idea of EIYPO (everything is you pushed out) and  that our assumptions about reality cause us to jump between the  possibilities of the wave function. Meaning that when I deeply assume a  behavior of my girlfriend, mother, friend etc. I will end up in a branch  where this actually happens. And if that is true, who are other people  even? Are they even conscious entities or am I just jumping as the only  solipsistic perspective between branches.I know this probably sounds  stupid to you. But this is freaking me out. I am in therapy already  because of this. It is horrible. I don't need any definitive proof  against it (as I know it probably does not exist). But do you have any  insight into this, that can put this into perspective? Is the theory  stupid? Is my interpretation wrong? Is it correct but I am viewing it  from a bad angle?

TL;DR: The idea  that everything that can exist does exist, causes me intense feelings of  panic and terror. I don't see any point in living if no action makes a  difference, since all outcomes exist anyways. And very very horrible  realities (eternal torture) also exist. Is there a way to escape this  perspective?",1

1594215566.0,Forbearance and Abstinence Based on Human Potentiality to Overcome Suffering," 

Russian prisoners who survived the Gulag Archipelago, Jewish prisoners in German prison camps as depicted in Man’s Search for Meaning, African slaves, prisoners of war throughout history, all have been able to valiantly find meaning in the worst atrocities committed to human beings – all without medication, or vice, to alleviate their suffering. How can we justify crutches, moral vices, or medication for less traumatic, less suffering inducing stressors, when those before us have endured tenfold and been able to survive, find meaning, and live happy, despite their much greater suffering, misfortune, and injustice?

If none of these people were afforded an escape, or an alleviation, and they had to find meaning, find a way to psychologically remain strong and continue living, why do we, who find ourselves in much more fortunate circumstances, deserve the ability to escape? How can we justify the escape from the misfortune of life when the rest of the world suffers, and has suffered, to a much greater extent? Everyone goes through horrible mental states, not everyone has the same experiences, and obviously some people’s justifications and circumstances imply a more profound suffering than many, yet given the horrendous crimes against humanity which we’ve valiantly overcome, individually, and societally, how can many of us still not see the potential as proven by our forefathers of the human ability to overcome the most horrendous difficulties, and in so recognizing not be utterly convinced of our own inert potential to do the same in our own lives?

If those in the worst situations imaginable, such as those who underwent the atrocities of the twentieth century, were offered medication to alleviate their suffering they surely would have taken it. If they were offered an escape, a pleasure, a pastime, a way out of their situation, they surely wouldn’t hesitate in accepting it. Yet the possibility of such things doesn’t make it optimal. The virtue of forbearance and courage in not reducing the experience through artificial means implies a greater potential gain in the overcoming of challenges. The task of running one-hundred miles barefoot is more impressive than he who runs one-hundred miles in shoes. He who undergoes the pain of existence through the strength of his character and will develops a stronger character than he who alleviates his suffering. There is a line, discernible with wisdom, of the place in which we should take medicine, at the place in which we should shirk responsibility and discipline for the optimization of wellbeing, a point where continued endurance would not provide a character benefit, but rather be harmful. That line is separate for every individual, yet we must not, in anticipatory anxiety, relieve ourselves of self responsibility and independence too soon, we must push to that line, rather than alleviate ourselves of the burden through fear of failure while we still contain the potential of going farther and thus overcoming more. This takes wisdom, and it is a necessary caveat to the voluntary ""cross bearing"" and suffering inherent in facing the demons of existence. Temperance through fire, forging through pressure, character creation, virtue establishment, these are things which any individual, in effectively integrating his psyche, should wish to promote. It is in those challenges that present themselves to us, in those moments of mental weakness, anxiety, anger, and sadness, that we are tested the most, and to which, in relation to, we have the greatest potential for improvement. The only determining factor is how we deal with these moments, these period, how we choose to cope with existence itself in its ups and downs. That which we do in this world has an effect on our character, on the totality of our Being. The way we navigate life now, influences our further navigation of life. The more inclined and susceptible we are to vice in the moment, the more we indulge in it, the more likely we are to in the future. We must not set ourselves up for continued suffering, nor continued weakness, we must only act strongly, in that which is most virtuous, in order to increase in virtue, and increase the probability of responding to difficulty with strength and virtue in the future.

It’s just hard, and by hard I mean impossible, in practical life, to prove one course of action is better than another, given our lack of foresight of all the variables and the unquantifiable nature of wellbeing, especially in relation to long possible future time branches in different action causal chains. These things are easy to philosophically reason but hard to apply in convincing others of their actual implementing. While the pursuance of meaning and the voluntary undertaking of difficulty in the pursuit of what one values, in personal growth, is accepted by all on a theoretical level as being “good” and praiseworthy”, to see it implemented in the lives of people who haven’t experientially realized the actual benefit in carrying out such activities, the change in lifestyle towards one in this direction is almost impossible to instantiate from the outside. It merely is an individual choice, a path to be undertaken by the willing participant, who opts for it *himself*. While we can gain inspiration, and the thought may come from outside, the undertaking of voluntary change, the adoption of responsibility and the pursuit of what one considers consciously as meaningful, is something that must be pursued from the individual of his own volition. All we can do, as contemplatives, as philosophers or psychologists, is point out the *potentiality* of such a path existing, and offer logical and rational explanations to its benefit, then, the individual must do more than believe in said justifications, he must test them in his own life. If they are optimal, and provide the meaning which he seeks, he will inevitably fall under the sway of such meaning seeking and carrying out. If he doesn’t find the optimal experiential evidence, he will revert to nihilism, or a less optimal pathway through life.

It's neither a fairy tale nor an epic movie where we are the main heroes. Life is not even an enjoyable video game where we emerge victorious in the end. In reality, we are not the center of the universe, but rather simple human beings wandering through the vastness of existence. Our actions, victories, and failures have little impact on the universe in the grand scheme of things, whether we live or die.

&#x200B;

Our parents, whom we saw as perfect beings when we were children, turn out to be entirely ordinary individuals as we grow up. They have their qualities and flaws, and they don't possess all the answers about life. This realization can be disconcerting and sometimes leaves us feeling alone, lost, and disoriented, without a guide to show us the way.

&#x200B;

We've always been told since childhood that we should work hard in school to avoid ending up homeless. I followed this advice diligently, sacrificing other aspects of my life that I now regret, such as my physical health, social skills, and self-confidence. My academic efforts paid off, but once that stage was completed, I found myself asking, ""Now what?"" My parents told me to get into a selective and demanding school and then find a well-paying job where I'd spend eight hours a day, five days a week, for the rest of my life until retirement. This prospect seemed absurd to me, spending my life waiting for weekends and holidays.

&#x200B;

Some would say, ""Do something that you're passionate about."" However, in today's competitive professional world, it's challenging to find a well-paying job that's also a passion. The further we progress in time, the more companies optimize their processes and demand specialized skills. At the age of 22, it sadly seems too late for me to train in a discipline I'm passionate about while earning a decent salary.

&#x200B;

I believe many people are in the same boat as me, facing the harsh realities of life for the first time, struggling to find their way and pay their bills. This raises the fundamental question: why live if life is mainly about suffering? Why persevere when moments of happiness are rare compared to difficult times?

Of course, it's possible to be happy, but it requires finding one's path, having a long-term vision, making efforts, and being lucky. Nevertheless, I still feel deeply unhappy seeing that it is realistically to late for me.

1677283986.0,Is life real or a dream? And is everything and everyone you know just things that your brain made up?,"I know this sounds weird but i have this “what if” thought sometimes that life is just a dream, like a really lucid one.

Let me start by saying this could essentially never work due to the amount of knowledge my non dreaming self (the version of me that is having the dream) would have to have. All the information in the world and books and data that’s been collected for so called millions of years would all be made up or stuff my non dreaming self would already know. This means for example I would know everything dating back from dinosaurs til now. And for my brain to hold this much knowledge it would need to be massive.

While what I said was a clear reason my original thought wouldn’t work, another reason is that everyone I know and everyone that’s existed would all need to be people I know from my non dreaming self or my brain would have to make them up and this would be an incredibly unrealistic and almost impossible thing due to the size my brain would need to be to make up people and their appearance, personality, thoughts, etc. 

Another reason why this would be extremely unrealistic is that this dream would be incredibly long. Say for example I live to 100y/o in this “dream” then in the real world (non dreaming world) it’s only been one night. And in that world I could be 7, 24, 3, 84, or 97 years old. 

Another thing I thought of is that technically this could go on infinitely. A dream in a dream in a dream and so forth. However obviously there’s a real world providing all the information to our brains to give us what we see in dreams. This means I could be a dream in a dream in a dream and I’ll never know. 

My final reason why this sounds ridiculous is that for everyone seeing this post, you would all not be real. You would all need to be figments of my imagination and whatever you’re thinking right now or about to respond with would be all something my brain came up with and I’m experiencing in this “dream”

1665960968.0,Do you believe we have anything alike a soul?,"Personally I don’t think so, I think we don’t have any inherent qualities at all. 

If we would be stripped of all present thoughts and emotions we’d be be something indifferent to life and death.

Most of what we rely on to recognize the self are the most prominent patterns within repeating thoughts and emotions, as well as our influence over them. 

I consider those patterns to be who I am, even though they of course change constantly. I’m convinced that the only reason I perceive myself as having continuity is because my memories present that illusion to me

I think it can be a beautiful philosophy if you allow it to exist outside of your directly perceived existence. If you can be of opinion that your thoughts and emotions are an extension of yourself, you can consider yourself present where you previously couldn’t.  

That is all fictional of course. Yet not any less fictional than considering yourself to have experienced a continuous existence. 

I think most of what we know boils down to discovering, sophisticating and communicating patterns. I figure that the most sincere way I can live is to believe something that reflects that.

That of course doesn’t mean to say it’s a bad thing to see yourself as continuous, that continuity emerged somehow. It allows us to set a course and sophisticate our way of life over time.

Temporarily breaking the illusion feels like a relief to me, the passing and eventual end of my perceived continuity scares me. 
Yet, if the one thing within me I could attribute as having anything resembling a soul,
 is something that already passes each moment. I realize it’ll feel the same for my body’s final moment. 

Sometimes I even dare to hope my thoughts and feelings extend beyond myself after all, that the joy that possesses me at times is the same joy that has and will possess many others. Perhaps all people experiencing the same thing, despite being in different situations share the same spirit.

Maybe...this explains why blackhole slows down time? Because their hardware couldn't render/process blackhole fast enough? Lag in real life?

Some people doesn't agree of simulation theory because it will require f\*ck ton of power and massive computer calculation(between 10\^33 and 10\^36 operations per second to simulate entire human history according to Nick Bostrom). However, you don't have to render everything to 100% quality. You only need to render what's being seen to your eyes...(Example when you look in front of your screen reading this, your vision which out of your range will be rendered to lower quality hence lower calculation required, which saves more power).

Just because there was a car accident happened outside your house doesn't mean it actually rendered 100% quality there...but when you move outside and look at it, then it will be rendered to 100% quality...you get the point..

Just look at what humanity able to achieve, from a simple pong pixelated dots game in the 1970s to hyper realistic graphics games today (2021) Red Dead Redemption for example. How long that it took? 50+ years. Can you imagine what graphic cards/hardware able to achieve after 100 or 200 or 1000 years from now?

We could probably able to make powerful video game simulation, that even the living game character AI in the game itself doesn't aware they're simulated because they 'believe' it's their reality. And then, when they get bored of their 'real life', they create computers to play games. The loop goes on and on and on and on. However, the games or simulation they created will be less and less powerful the more simulation are made. Just like VMware inside of operating system inside of VMware inside of operating system inside of VMware inside of operating system inside of VMware. The more virtualization you made, the less resources you can use for virtualization.

But why?! Why create simulation? Just look at ourselves today...we have TONS of games. We made games for our own entertainment. Don't you think there is a possibility reason why we are in simulation is because we are just entertainment for the reality out there? Or MAYBE, just maybe...someone created simulation of us to predict a hypothetical scenario? To see what happen if human do x, then event y will happen.

1615667449.0,Criticism of Existentialists,"This is not a general criticism for people who identify as Existentialist but for people who join this subreddit and post edgelord immaturities without any depth of thought or actual complications given to their questions.  


You can't just read a single sentence on existentialism and what's it's about and write   
""If you can't give meaning to your life yourself, should you give up?""  


This sounds like a question a teenager could ask on their first contact with someone explaining philosophy to them.

Let's deconstruct this a little. So give up what? A person who can't find meaning in their lives, either external, or constructed by them, cannot, by definition, give anything up, since they don't have anything to give up. They have no other option.   


Existentialism is not some game, where you play it for a day, then decide if you give it up or not because you failed at some vague notion of an objective.  


People would be much better served, being more humane and showcasing some humility. Like, hey, I am thinking about what video game to play while my father is dying in an ICU due to covid complications, and I find this somewhat close to that feeling ppl call ""the absurd"". how can I introduce more of this feeling into my life, since I feel it is in direct contrast to depression, meaning that depression causes less absurdity to rise, and absurdity makes me feel more real and honest with what is happening in reality.  


Or, social conventions, take us from birth to death, and it seems like there's ways to deal with anything as long as we stick to them. When I try to improvise and live more authentically, I find that I feel events become more meaningless instead of more meaningful. Do you have similar experiences?  


Or, I can't stop thinking about that painting ""Scream"", I find that description about suddenly everything inducing something like an existential panic attack very familiar. I sense that going towards that kind of feeling is dangerous but otherwise, I feel I'm just repressing all these things, what could be up.  


Then maybe some people who have READ some of the existential/absurdist texts/documents/books can shine a light on these connection in a deeper way.   


I'm sorry, I find most posts here infantile (while the comments seem to be a little more deep), and it strikes me as completely absurd that in 2021 all this philosophy is to be discussed in such a simplistic and superficial way, especially in reddit. I can't help but feel the contrast between what I wanted this subreddit to be, a place for deepening my intuitions and questions, and what it is, some complaints about life being meaningless or meaningful, AD NAUSEUM, until the word meaning actually loses all meaning itself. It's SAD",1

1685652940.0,Religion is just a construct of human perception (no but really guys 🤔🥴),"In philosopher David Hume's 'A Treatise of Human Nature' he writes about ideas - an early development of our understanding of psychology. This was used basically to support Empiricism and disprove any innate Knowledge. He writes about simple ideas, which are just singular concepts, objects and features i.e. the colour blue, a nose, addition, etc, before explaining complexed ideas, which means to form several singular objects together to create a new image. You do this in the following ways:

Transpose - To transport features (Thomas the tank engine - human face on a train)

Compound - Gold and a mountain = golden mountain

Augment = to enlarge an image (a dog the size of earth)

Diminish = to shrink an image (a dog the size of a flea).

Your minds abilities cannot go further than these 4 features, and are therefore limited to these, therefore these become intuitive upon understanding.

So how does it apply to religion? Simple. God's omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent features, seen as the most fundamental, are derived from the simple concepts (ideas) of power, knowledge and love. 

With Islam's prophet story, the pegasus is just derived from the simple features of a horse and wings. 

In Hinduism, Ganesha is derived from the simple features of an elephant, the colours Gold and pink and the human arms. 

The Buddhas birth story involved him coming from a white elephant (I think you can work that one out).

Even things like Nibbana, Heaven and Hell and the prophet Mohammed, all of which are things people say can't be put into image or described according to biblical accuracy, they still come from the simple and singular concept of unknowingness.

I can therefore say all humans in the past have derived all the aspects of religion from their surroundings, whether consciously or subconsciously, and have used imagery to convey these aspects to other people, whether through dreams, visions, hallucinations, mythology, lies and falsehoods, etc 

One criticism of this comes from Decartes, who basically says you can only hold the concept (thought + intuition) because God put it there i.e. God allows you have simple and complexed ideas in the first place. This is an arguement for regression and dependence. 

A counter to this is that thoughts aren't even possible until you've first had an experience. You aren't able to think aloud in your head until you're able to speak aloud with your mouth; you aren't able to think using imagery until you've seen the image of something in the real world. This is known as the Copy Principle. You can't form an idea if your senses + abilities haven't recieved or projected them first. As Hume addresses it: ""A blind man can form no notion of colour; nor a deaf man sound.""

The brains ability to form thoughts come from the frontal lobe and fired neurons; we repeat an occurred experience and replicate it with less vivacity in our minds, therefore thoughts depend on the brain chemistry, not God. It also seems as though religion is solely derived from the human's innate ability of creativity, and is therefore a human construct. 

Neiztche wrote that humans started off as beings with little intellect and superiority, putting us on the same level as animals. The only reason why we can think and understand the way we do is because of millions of years of coming over the inferior, the weak and the dumb, therefore our advancement wasn't just gifted to us, it was just by luck and chance, which explains the rest of the universe in an atheistic perspective.",1

1697711775.0,I’m scared and lost,"Recently, my longstanding fear of death and feelings of nihilism have intensified. I’ve struggled with these issues since I was 6 years old, and now, at 17, they have become overwhelming. While I understand that death is a natural part of life, the idea of not existing terrifies me.

Most people offer the perspective that death is ‘like life before you were born,’ but that analogy doesn’t resonate with me. Before I was born, I hadn’t built relationships, formed memories, or developed an appreciation for life. Therefore, the idea of reverting to that state is deeply unsettling.

Although I identify as an atheist, a part of me hopes for an afterlife where I can reunite with loved ones. The thought that death might mean the end of my existence—and that my life’s actions would then be meaningless—disturbs me greatly.

Adding to the complexity, my mental health struggles, including ADHD and possibly depression and BPD, make these fears even more debilitating. I feel trapped in a state of emotional limbo. I want to seek professional help, but I can’t afford therapy and don’t feel I can discuss this with my parents.

Now, my primary concern isn’t so much about how I will die, but rather the unsettling transition from living to not living. This has affected me to the point where it’s difficult to even sleep.",1

The most popular variant of Existentialism is atheistic, but modern existential thought was originally Christian in origin. The father of existentialism, Søren Kierkegaard, was a Christian philosopher and author. Kierkegaard developed his existential philosophy in reaction to the prevailing trends of philosophy in his time, specifically Hegelianism.
This passage from Kierkegaard, in a letter dated August 1, 1835, is frequently used to encapsulate existential thought:

*What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.*


Since Kierkegaard, many religious existentialists have taken up the themes Kierkegaard proposed and developed their own kinds of existential thought, from Buber and Marcel to Tillich and Barth. This subreddit is interested in exploring the religious side of existential thought and related questions and ideas.

What meaning does a waves crashing hold?

But If life was supposed to be meaningless, we all would have never given Consciousness by evolution and we all would be dead brain, just existing and doing our work till we die like all of animal kingdom (Tho most humans also work that way), you see animals don't need a meaning to their life cuz they are born with it. This post applies perfectly to all the animals in the world, except humans. Cuz humans have consciousness. 

In this way evolution cursed us to find our own meaning of life, right?

But still, evolution gave us consciousness, why? Think about it. 

Well, the literally answer here is to choose our own jobs, you see in our hunter gatherer world the jobs were going increasingly complex. Someone was a fighter, someone was a food gatherer. Someone was explorer. Someone was the cook and someone had to manage it all. 

So evolution thought of giving humans consciousness, so you know we can choose our own speciality and master in it, thus increasing efficiency. And this actually worked out for us. 

Now if you replace jobs with the meaning of life. Then you'll understand pretty quick that evolution gave us consciousness to decide our meaning of life. It's like existentialist philosophers said, Life is meaningless until we add our own meaning to it.

Why do so many humans succumb to the dramatics and worries of unnecessary conflict even when it is very clearly shown to them that it creates nothing but misery along the path to death 

The idea of most natural things in this universe being symmetrical in some way blows my mind and there has to be something larger regarding that. Every action must have an equal and opposite reaction physically, but this rule seems to apply to mostly everything. I guess it’s probably because there is not a single thing in this world that is definite and it all lies on sets of spectrums. Yet again, who knows, I’m just a floating monkey on a rock


Absurdism is the only way to live, because whilst knowing that life is meaningless and continuing to give it meaning gives happiness in life and death, therefore, if you know that life has no meaning, have you discovered the meaning of life?????????

Anyway, I'd like to share with you a peculiar event that happened to me as I was waking up from a deep nap the other day.

I took a nap after work as I was extremely tired, and it lasted about 20 minutes. As I was waking up from my nap, I could almost swear that I felt myself (and my consciousness) ""booting up"". I remember a state of blackness in the very early milliseconds of waking up, and my consciousness becoming aware of everything, and I had a line of extremely existential thoughts in this small blip of a second. The thoughts that came to me were along the lines of ""Existence? This is so tiring"", ""Why do I have to exist?"", ""Why is there anything?"", ""There is only loss in existence"", and ""Why am I coming to be?'. I truly wish I could better describe the deep existential angst that rushed upon me.I felt as I was literally being thrown into reality for the first time. It's funny because, if you really think about it, everytime we wake up from sleep, we truly are being thrown back into the cage of reality. At the same time, while I was having these thoughts, I was also paired with extreme existential dread about these thoughts (and luckily, this dissipated as I woke up).

This blog explores the relevance of Seneca's teachings in the 21st century and how they can provide a philosophical anchor that transcends the ages.

It delves into the relevance of Seneca's teachings on virtue, resilience, and mindful living in the context of contemporary life. Seneca's steadfast advocacy for virtue as the highest good provides a compass for ethical decision-making in a world often characterized by moral ambiguity and shifting values. Meanwhile, his insights on resilience and reason offer a Stoic framework for navigating the challenges of a fast-paced life with grace and composure.

Seneca's philosophy also challenges prevailing norms of consumerism and the pursuit of financial success by encouraging reflection on our relationship with possessions and the true meaning of wealth. It concludes by exploring practical applications of Seneca's philosophy in the modern world and how individuals can integrate these principles into their daily lives to foster a resilient mindset, ethical decision-making, and a mindful approach to success and well-being.

In summary, Seneca's timeless wisdom offers actionable insights for those seeking a more intentional and fulfilling existence in our fast-paced contemporary world.

## After Life

One of the ego’s prime motivations is survival; one of its prime fears is death. If death is the end, then we simply cease to exist—an idea that horrifies some people.

What happens to me after death? Do I survive in some form or another? We’ll explore the questions and *speculate* about some answers, without pretending to any special knowledge as to what actually occurs.

## After Life: Heaven and Hell

One answer to the question of what happens after death is that my eternal soul survives. Some religions say the soul exists for all eternity, ultimately in either heaven or hell.\[i\] The soul is not God. It is separate and distinct from God. It is ontologically basic. God creates the soul but once created, it exists for all eternity.

The idea of an eternal heaven and hell raises some problems.

The first problem is that heaven or hell seem inappropriate for the great majority of people, who live moderately good lives (but don’t dedicate themselves to helping the poor, or to ceaselessly praying to God) and moderately bad lives (sometimes dishonest or selfish or unkind).

The second problem concerns the nature of the self. Over a lifetime, a person will have many selves, e.g., the infant, the student; the employee; the spouse, the parent, the grandparent. Given that temporary selves come and go, we may ask: Which of our many temporary selves persist into the afterlife? Which selves go to heaven (or hell)?

Consider, for example, Saint Augustine, who was sexually active in his youth, fathering a son with a woman he never married. He famously prayed: “God, give me chastity and continency, only not yet.” Later, he repented and became a saint. Did Augustine’s erotic self go to heaven along with his saintly self? 

Or consider Zoe, a sweet old woman who passed at 90. Imagine Zoe had a characteristic fault, say, envy. If Zoe goes to heaven, does her envious self go there, too?

Another problem: once in heaven can I change and grow? Can I gain and lose temporary selves? Suppose Ann, Zoe’s granddaughter, looks forward to meeting Zoe in heaven. Ann remembers Zoe as she was at 90. But suppose in heaven Zoe prefers her 19-year-old body to her 90-year-old body. And suppose Zoe’s envious self no longer exists. And suppose Zoe has satisfied a lifelong wish to understand Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Being in heaven, she can easily fulfill that wish. When Ann finally meets Zoe in heaven, does she meet the person she expected to meet? Or a disappointingly different person?

Further, in heaven, Zoe can learn anything she wishes and—within limits—become anything she wishes. Within limits. But eternity is a long, long, long time. After untold billions and trillions of years, do the limits chafe? Might Zoe eventually desire the ultimate: to become God? The legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven seems to answer “Yes.” The story suggests eternal existence as a separate person may ultimately become unsatisfying. Perhaps only God can withstand eternity.

Millions long for immortality who don't know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon. — Susan Ertz

Another observation is that heaven and hell make the universe (also called “creation”) pointless. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Eventually, only heaven and hell will exist. Many Christians believe that will occur at the second coming of Jesus. A Catholic might say later, after all the souls in purgatory have paid their debt and migrated to heaven. But Christians agree that at some time in the future only heaven and hell will exist.

2. Before creation, God knew exactly which people would end up in heaven and which people would end up in hell (assuming God can foresee the future).

3. God could have created people destined for heaven IN HEAVEN, bypassing life on earth entirely. God could have created people destined for hell IN HELL, bypassing life on earth entirely.

4. Conclusion: The entire drama of creation—the Fall, the passion of Jesus, etc., etc.—is entirely unnecessary. God could have skipped creation entirely. God could have created in heaven people who God knew would go there. God could have created in hell people who God knew would go there. (A kinder, gentler God would have simply not created people who would end up in hell.)

It seems there are logical problems with the idea of an eternal soul and an eternal heaven and hell.\[ii\] Of course, if eternally individual souls in an eternal heaven or hell were ever proven to exist then we’d need to revise or abandon our basic premise of monism—something we should always be willing to do if we want to follow the evidence.

## After Life: Reincarnation

Another answer to the question of what happens to me after death is that I eventually reincarnate. To be more precise, the permanent self and some traits and tendencies\[iii\] eventually reincarnate. This idea occurs in Hinduism where, in one version, the *jivatma* is the individual soul which reincarnates but “after a long process of development and experience again returns to the unity of the Ātmā,”\[iv\] i.e., the One. In this view, a permanent individual self is not eternal; it ultimately merges back with the One, from whence it came, as a river merges with the ocean.

Buddhism also has the idea of reincarnation except in Buddhism no permanent self exists. Buddhism says that the permanent self is illusory. It says there is nothing underlying the temporary selves that come and go.\[v\] We are at any time merely a bundle of our current temporary selves. This idea occurs in Buddhism’s *Anatta*\[vi\] doctrine (non-self doctrine) which says I consist only of the “five aggregates”: perception, material form, feelings, mental activity, and consciousness. At death, the five aggregates cease to function or disperse (as the atoms of our body return to the biosphere) and I simply cease to exist.

Yet Buddhism accepts that reincarnation is possible. Reincarnation of what? A difficult question. One answer is that, as in Hinduism, some residue of our temporary selves somehow forms the personality of a newborn. Just as one candle lights another, passing on its flame, somehow our tendencies pass on to another being, a being which also lacks a permanent self.

## After Life: Between Lives

Let’s suppose I and the body have parted, but I’m still am aware of thoughts and emotions. I as consciousness along with some emotional and mental tendencies somehow continue to exist. What would it be like? Like dreaming? Like being alone in a dark room?

Like being trapped in some closed, confined space? No. If I’ve left the body, then I am spaceless. Without a body, what is there to be confined? Can a box confine thought? Can a box limit emotion? Can a box imprison consciousness? Evidently not. So, let’s imagine the emotion/thought/consciousness complex free floating, in some vast space, or a place where the word “space” has no meaning.

A fish freed from a bottle, swimming in a vast ocean, might look back at the bottle and notice how small and limiting the bottle was. We might reflect on what the body/emotion/mind complex usually contained: merely pleasant or unpleasant body sensations, happy or sad emotions, thoughts of various kinds. Nothing profound, usually. We might see memory, too, and all the past snapshots memory holds. And it all might seems so . . . small. Finite. Interesting in its own way. But does it all merit remembering? Or can much of it be forgotten?\[vii\] Most people are born with no memory of a past life. And for those that do claim memories of a past life, the memories are often of a traumatic incident such as being executed or dying in some accident. If we reincarnate, do we routinely forget most of our past life?\[viii\]

Let’s now imagine consciousness in the between-lives state. *The Tibetan Book of the Dead*\[ix\] describes what occurs, according to Tibetan belief. Briefly, the consciousness/tendencies complex begins a natural ascent to its source, its ultimate ground: the Real. On first encountering the Incomprehensible Boundless Light, some deceased persons merge, losing their separate identity and ending reincarnations. Other deceased persons retreat from the intensity of supreme naked reality, and descend to lower levels of existence. The text describes the deceased as experiencing “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities before finally incarnating in a physical body. We might imagine some deceased persons able to wander in the Mindscape, sampling thoughts and ideas as they please. We might imagine others wandering the Emotescape, sampling emotions of all kinds. Others descend to the physical plane, taking birth in another body, previous existence having been mostly forgotten, although there are stories of young children recalling scenes from an alleged previous life. Reincarnation has occurred.

*The Tibetan Book of the Dead* says the “peaceful” and “wrathful” deities are projections of one’s own mind. We might imagine experiencing peaceful deities as heaven and wrathful deities as hell. But why would our own mind create such experiences?

Imagine a loving person who spent their life helping others, trying to make the world a better place. A person who thought, mostly, kind, loving and noble thoughts. That person alone with his/her emotions and thoughts would be in a light, elevated place: a “heaven.”

On the other hand, imagine a person who spent a life filled with greed, hate, and anger alone with those emotions. He will have no one to hate but himself. No one to be the target of his anger but himself. The experience would be a dark, oppressive state: a “hell.”

Thus, there could be a type of judgment built into the universe, without the need of some God who is a person. A judgment based on the fact that it’s more comfortable to experience love rather than hate, more comfortable to experience peace rather than violence. There could be a temporary, non-eternal heaven and hell awaiting us in the between-lives state.

## After Life: No Afterlife

Death is when the body ceases to function. Perhaps our emotional and mental activities also cease to exist. Perhaps, our consciousness ceases to function, too. Consciousness seems to disappear during deep sleep, so it’s easy to believe it ceases to exist after death.

So, another answer is that at death my deep self and temporary selves simply cease to exist. One moment I’m consciousness—let’s say, right now. The next moment Arthur is nowhere to be found.\[x\] His permanent self, if he had one, has vanished. Death is the end, utter annihilation.

Let’s suppose for a moment that this is the case; that when I die, I utterly cease to exist. Many people would find the idea frightening, even horrifying. However, if I cease to exist, I won’t be there to know it. The thought is not so threatening when I realize that I can never experience the state of non-existing.\[xi\] After I realize that, ceasing to exist may seem less fearful, even inconsequential. For, if we rule out reincarnation, then before I existed, I couldn’t experience anything, including the state of non-existing.

“I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” — Mark Twain

Similarly, if I utterly cease to exist after death, I’ll never know it. I’ll never experience it. I can only experience the thought of non-existing. A thought may be sad or frightening, but it’s still only a thought. Thoughts come and go.

Sadness might be a more appropriate response. For if I cease to exist upon death, then all those who have died previously—family members, friends, acquaintances—have ceased to exist, too. If that were true, it would be natural to experience sadness.

Many people are deeply attached to the idea of an eternal soul, or to some sort of continued existence. The no-afterlife answer may appear threatening and frightening. It’s natural that an ego would regard non-existence as a horror.

A response is that being a soul—being an eternal individual, eternally separate from God—may not be so desirable, as we noted previously in the legend of Satan’s rebellion in heaven.

Also, we can contrast the idea of an eternal soul with another, possibly superior, concept. The idea of an eternal soul says we came *into* the universe. It suggests we are not a part of nature, but spiritual visitors in a material world. Thus, the only world we know is depreciated. Matter is dumb and “there must be something more.” And the environment suffers abuse.

A possibly superior concept is that we didn’t come coming into the universe; we came *out of* it.\[xii\] Our relation to the universe is like that of the apple to the apple tree. That I (or, at least, my body) came out of the universe is why the common elements of the universe (with one exception) are the common elements of my body. The most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, in descending order. Helium is a noble gas that doesn’t combine with other elements to form molecules. If we discard helium, we find that the most abundant elements in the human body are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, in descending order.

The universe has become me (and everything else). And we know matter is hardly dumb. Rather, it contains complexity beyond imagination. In trying to understand matter, we are forced to ideas like string theory and quantum field theory, complex theories that may not be complex enough to capture all that matter can do.

If we call matter “dumb” we insult ourselves, because matter is what we are. If we understood ourselves correctly—as temporary manifestations of something vast and ancient beyond comprehension—that would be enough.

So, suppose death is the utter end to Arthur. So what? Why should I care if my finite self persists beyond the life of the body? Most of the time, my finite self focuses on corresponding finite concerns - how to be comfortable; how to gain wealth, power and fame—or focuses on entertainment that puts the mind in a passive state, so that I can hardly remember an advertisement I saw just a few minutes ago. Of course, our lives are also filled with noble moments, too. Moments of love, of empathy, of elevated thoughts. But these moments pale measured against our infinite self, our vast and ancient larger self, the universe itself.

Perhaps, eternal existence as a limited, finite self is not as desirable as it seems. In any case, it can be argued that non-existence is nothing to fear.

## Self-Transcendence

Suppose I am entirely physical. Suppose I am matter and only matter, matter that somehow is conscious and intelligent. Suppose my destiny as an individual is annihilation. When I die, I utterly cease to exist. The biosphere absorbs my body’s atoms. My emotions, mind, and consciousness simply cease to be. This idea may seem unwelcome, threatening, and frightening. But considered deeply, it can lead to self-transcendence. And self-transcendence can be viewed as a type of salvation, salvation from fear of death.

As we’ve seen, if I’m merely matter, matter which lacks a soul, then it’s plain that I didn’t come into the universe; I came out of it. My body emerged from the universe. I emerged from the universe. I am not separate from the universe but a part of it. The universe gave me birth. It is my parent. Something which is ancient and vast beyond imagination has given me birth. I am a person on a planet with billions of other people, a planet that is a microscopic speck of dust in an almost infinite universe.

I am a small speck. Yet, I can contemplate the vast and ancient universe. I feel my small presence in the infinite universe and the feeling is an odd mixture: one part realizing my own smallness and insignificance; one part feeling a part of a vast, magnificent universe, no matter if only an infinitesimally small part. The universe has created me. I am not the universe but the universe is me, just as the wave is not the ocean but the ocean is the wave. Something ancient and vast has become me. 

*The God’s Script****\[xiii\]*** by Jorge Luis Borges tells the story of Tzinacán, an Aztec priest imprisoned and tortured by the Spaniards. After decades in prison, Tzinacán has a vision; he believes certain words of power will destroy his stone prison, evict the Spaniards, reconstruct his nation, and make him immortal. But he knows he never shall utter the words, because “Whoever has seen the universe, whoever has beheld the fiery designs of the universe, cannot think in terms of one man, or that man’s trivial fortunes or misfortunes, though he be that very man.”

Tzinacán has achieved salvation, salvation from ego concerns, a type of salvation unlike the ego salvation of Old Theology religions.

We live in an unimaginably vast and ancient universe. Yet, our concerns often revolve about ourselves. Ego issues dominate: “I want to go to heaven. I want to be reincarnated. I. Me. I.” Ego concerns are understandable; they help us survive. But the person who can self-transcend, who can rise above ego; the person who can say to the Real, “You exist. And that’s enough for me. *What does it matter if this finite, flawed human being lives for eternity, or is snuffed out like a candle?*”—that person has a faith and a love for God far above those who practice religion out of fear of hell, hope of heaven, or of a better reincarnation.

A person who achieves that perspective while still in the body has achieved some degree of self-transcendence. That person finds their “I” in the Real rather than in the ego and its transitory selves. Mystic slogans such as “Die before you die” and “The art of dying” take on a real, literal meaning. Self-transcendence utterly defeats death. For if I die to my transitory selves before the death of my body, then there is nothing that death can take.

## After Life: Recap

To sum up, an axiom of New Theology’s monism is that only the All and the One, the Ultimate Ground of Existence, is ontologically basic. The individual is not ontologically basic. This implies that the human individual is like a figure on a movie screen and would cease to exist but for the action of the light; that the individual is the wave, not the ocean. This view admits two possibilities. First, that upon death the individual simply dissolves, ceases to be. This is often the view of the atheist.\[xiv\] The second is that upon death the individual continues to exist in one form or another, perhaps in heaven or hell, perhaps reincarnating eventually.

Although our fate immediately after death is unknown, in a monist system the ultimate fate of the individual can be nothing other than merging with the ultimate ground of all.

You are not the body. You are not the mind.

You are something different, lying far behind.

\[ii\] Existence in heaven raises other questions about selfhood. Consider the idea of an assembly of selves. Suppose Joe at six years old was happy and optimistic; a more mature person when he received his first romantic kiss; at twenty, a personal tragedy turned him pessimistic and dour; at forty, Joe was a sober, responsible family man; at death, a calm, retired introvert. Is Joe in heaven somehow a composite of all these selves? If Joe goes to hell, do all the selves suffer, even the happy, optimistic six-year older?

Have you ever taken a moment to wonder if there might be more to humans than meets the eye? It's a bit peculiar, but let's embark on an enjoyable journey to explore this notion further.  
Consider pudding for a moment. It's soft, sweet, and offers an array of flavors. In a similar fashion, humans come in all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds. Our diverse experiences and the choices we make in life create a unique tapestry, much like the various flavors of pudding.  
But there's an interesting parallel here. Just as pudding has layers, so do our minds. Within us, there are different layers of thoughts and feelings. Some are readily apparent, like the creamy top layer of pudding, while others lie deeper, concealed from plain view. Similar to the way we scoop through pudding to discover its hidden layers, we can peel back the layers of our thoughts and emotions.  
Now, you might be wondering why we're drawing this comparison between humans and pudding. It's not merely for the sake of amusement. Instead, it's a way to illustrate that, like pudding, we humans possess both fragility and resilience. Life can be a bit like a spoon cutting through pudding — it can be tough at times. But just as pudding doesn't lose its sweetness when stirred or served, we humans have a remarkable ability to bounce back and adapt, even when faced with adversity.  
As we delve deeper into this idea, we'll explore the intricacies of human thought, the rich tapestry of emotions we experience, and the underlying connections that bind us together as a species. This journey promises to challenge your perspective on what it means to be human.  
So, let's maintain the simplicity and sweetness of this analogy as we continue to explore the playful comparison between humans and pudding. Get ready for an engaging and enlightening adventure into the heart of what defines us as individuals and as a species!

As a thought experiment, let us consider the perspective that perhaps each apparent being is but a hand of The Great Memester. Maybe its implied message were as follows:

1669429056.0,"The only way existence could have been created for a reason is if there was an intelligent being behind it, who could think about such reason and furthermore think about such reason in a human-like way.","I know this statement is obvious, but I admit it is an obvious truth I have missed when thinking about why anything exists at all. If we ask why anything exists, we’re demanding a reason. I was always searching for something like ‘it exists because it’s good to create a way for the universe to realise and explore itself’ and of course this is literally like saying god created it all because he needed to pump some life into the dark universe! 

The truth is you can give a reason without needing a god to conjure up that reason in the first place. That reason is simply there is no emotional intellectual reasoning behind existence, it’s just existence is naturally necessary. If it wasn’t this way you wouldn’t be aware and so this is the only state your life can exist. That’s obvious, but I’ve been really trying to get to grips with what this life is and ultimately I believe this could be used to figure out whether life’s conditions can just be attributed to being the necessities of nature, or have indeed been designed by intelligence. 

Lately this is something that has been on my mind as I’m sure has plagued countless other minds in the past on earth and out there in the universe, which is also cool to think about. I think a lot of people agree that life is neither good nor bad, we’re not in eternal hell, but it’s not an eternal party either. I am very blessed where I am in life, I’m beyond grateful that I’m born now and not living in the dark ages with such damning existential thoughts. Life is cruel , it can be painful, but we cannot ignore the immense pleasures it can also give. Our consciousness has popped out from the unknown and it will return to the unknown. With a life of such a range experience all the way down to torture etc, I know that if death was not an option there would be no escape from its chaos and so is this just one of the reasons that begs the question whether it was intelligently designed or not? I think not, but that was just an example so you get the idea.

Honestly the only reason that I ponder all this stuff is because I want to know that I’m not just some colourful offshoot of nature that has nothing caring for my existence. I mean we’re all so helpless down here on earth. I can scream at nature all I want, but it will never hear me, nature doesn’t care, it can’t, we are nature and we’re trapped within our own prison if that makes sense. We’re nature come to finally realise itself and go ‘oh fuck, I was better off just swimming around as billions of cells in that acid pool down there’. Why! Why is nature programmed to get to us! To build a being capable of existential terror! What the fuck 😂 but maybe it’s a necessary evil in order to also allow for such existential revelations which fill us with wonder and freedom in such an absurd way. I think that’s probably how everything is, have one good thing and you got to have the opposite, at least in this world. 

Maybe that’s the thing that got us here in the first place. Something and nothing must exist together and so the only universe that can be born is one which has an opposite of what it is, which in any case is logically nothing. So that’s right this is the only way existence can be. I’ll say it again : If you’re going to have anything at all then the only opposite of that is complete nothingness. The only laws which can come from complete nothingness are these ones, everything has an opposite and that’s literally neither good nor bad, it is just what it has to be. What does this mean for my desire of life after death? No clue, perhaps it means that even in nothingness I could still become something? I don’t know, do you think that everything must have an opposite or do you perhaps believe a concept like heaven could logically exist. Am I too ambitious, is it useless to try and come up with necessary laws when ultimately they’re created from this universe and so I can never hope to even understand ‘true reality’? All I know is it seems logical, it seems logical that the concept of somethingness and nothingness are the same wherever in existence you go.",1

1650109457.0,Not sure anymore,"       I don't think many people have as much nonsense jostling around in their noggins and I wonder why. Why doesn't existentialism appeal to everyone? The realms of uncertainty interest me. I'm an oddball, a loner and rambler. A nomad that goes wherever the wind blows me. I'm an opportunist, I want to experience everything, talk to everyone and try to make sense of the nonsense. I guess it transformed from poetry and writing lyrics to creative writing and philosophy- for me. When I'm in a good mood I write a lot but when I'm sad I write better- at least I think so. It's hard because I can't grasp the attention of the masses. Maybe I don't want that, maybe I don't want fame, just understanding and to inspire or wake up the slumberers who are ready for enlightenment. I have a lot of love and want to share my experiences so others can learn or see different points of view. Though, people don't see value in that. In my eyes, wisdom is wealth. In society's eyes, success and popularity is wealth. I just want you to know who I am, so you can try to know who you are- and also help me know who I am even further. 


        I'm not sure about anything anymore. Sometimes I feel a certain way about certain things. Then I feel completely stupid and helpless of what certain. It's humbling I suppose. Is nothing supposed to make sense? Could it be false perception and a delusion? My reality takes many forms. It alters, skews and breeds infinite possibilities. Sure, it can be scary not knowing anything, helpless and lost- but aren't we all helpless and lost together? If we stopped being so selfish and tried to figure out our purpose together- maybe we'd get somewhere. Great minds think alike, but great minds combined can help others form understanding of themselves. I'm kind of just babbling away at this point.


       Life isn't pointless. I think there's meaning in it and we just cannot comprehend its purpose. I hope in the end our questions will be  answered. As above, so below, microscopic to catastrophic. We are copies of everything, part of a fractal repeating pattern. ",1

I did in fact after about 30 seconds begin to feel that experience of disassociation from myself. I felt like I could see myself (my physical body) through the lenses of my conscience. 

I used to have this episodes from time to time, sometimes rarely and other times more often. But now I wanted to see if I could trigger it myself. Turns out I somewhat can.

1641903225.0,Access to Ding an sich. There is no illusion.,"Access to Ding an sich.


Kant's Critique of Pure Reason might solve his problem of Hume's scepticism – in the a priori intuitions of time and space, and the categories of understanding, but at the (famous) cost of removing any knowledge of things in themselves (Ding an sich). This, Kant considers, is his 'Copernican Revolution' in philosophy. Something which Quentin Meillassoux calls a ""Ptolemaic Counter-Revolution."" (After Finitude: An Essay On The Necessity Of Contingency). And by others  as a problem of not having access to things in themselves, ( Meillassoux's 'great Outdoors'.) This idea, of only having access via our senses and concepts appears as a scepticism which regards our experiences of the world as mere illusion. 

The problem is solved in Descartes, his doubt is refuted in his cogito, and from that he establishes God. A God whose nature is not to deceive, so our knowledge, if clear and distinct, is thus guaranteed. Kant has no such guarantee. And many now would likewise not depend on God as the guarantor of knowledge of the world. 

But what Kant did not have is the theory of evolution by random mutation and natural selection. He never gives the origin of the intuitions and categories, thus no guarantor of their truth in access to reality as is. However for an evolutionist the source of our faculties is nature itself. The eye is a product of nature, thus a product of light. We see light, for that reason – as it is – in the spectrum that we do. As nature changes, when it changes, a species not 'comfortable' with the change dies out. Thus the species which remain adapt to nature, by random selection. The guarantee of access to things as they are is that by a random process they must be. Made not by design but by chance. A final example, human flying machines worked when humans understood the design of an aerofoil. Nature arrived at this design by accident.  Both 'work' by virtue of the reality of the aerofoil. In the case of nature & birds – ignorant of this. 

So we have access to the world, as we are the casts of its mould.",1

1592268103.0,I could use some criticism on an article I wrote its on agnosticism vs. Atheism and nihilism,"Look people think that this world’s super complicated and it can be at times. Let me simplify it for you: Everyone in the world can be put into one of two categories. The distinction between these two groups of people is how they answer the question:

“Why?”

as in “Why do we exist!?”

There are many theories to answer this question but they all stem from one basic belief. To find out where you stand ask yourself this simple question.

Do I believe there is objective truth?

It’s a simple question, really it is. You either believe there is objective truth or you don’t. Objective truths are truths that are true regardless of the existence of humanity. Or in other words if a tree falls in a forest and no ones around to see it, does it make a sound? If you believe, as I, that objective truths do exist. Then ask yourself the following question: 

What is a valid way to discover objective truth?

There have been many theories proposed to answer this question. But I've simplified them down into their simplest categories. But before we delve into that let me address two false assumptions people often make.  

 

#1. Human senses can prove something to be true. This is a fallacy.* It's the fallacy of ""begging the question."" It's as if I were to tell you: Cigarettes are deadly because they kill people. I've given no proof of my claim instead I am simply repeating my claim.  

* A fallacy is “a failure in reasoning which renders an argument invalid.” 

 

#2. Reason is a valid way to determine objective truth. Human reasoning is not a valid way to discern objective truth. Assuming human reasoning to be a guide to objective truth is circular logic. Since you cannot prove that human reasoning is a guide to objective truth without assuming that human reasoning is a guide to objective truth. 

 

After addressing these two assumptions we branch out onto two paths or as I’ll call them options. I choose the word options because every person chooses to believe certain basic truths to be true. In these decisions arguing is impossible because we are dealing with extremely basic ideas. You choose what you believe and if you are honest you will accept the logical outcomes of your belief. 

 

Option one. There is no objective truth and, by default, all truth is relative. 

If you believe this then you are by definition either an Atheist or a Nihilist. The distinction between the two is that atheists claim that there is truth and meaning to life but only as we humans beings define it. Of course this opens many moral dilemmas because if truth is truly subjective than any purpose, however ridiculous, is valid.

If someone were to find meaning and purpose in eating rocks, or feeding homeless people, or even blowing stuff up. It would still be a valid purpose since By this world view humans are the author of meaning. If you subscribe to atheism then all purposes are equally viable. Not equally likely but equally viable.

Nihilist on the other hand view all existence is meaningless. They hold that all purpose, even man ordained purpose and meaning, is pointless. Since in the end the stars burn out and all the atoms in existence decay into chaos. All “meaning” is destroyed but that’s okay because nothing mattered anyways. 

But wait! I’m not finished I believe I can convince you that all atheists and nihilists are illogical and that it’s actually more reasonable to be agnostic. Before I get to my argument I ask that if you are an atheist or nihilist that you abide by the rules of logic and at least try to understand my argument. 

The vast majority of atheists* subscribe to the theory of evolution and most of them believe that we are simply matter in motion. That humans have no soul or “invisible part.”  I’ll concede that the theory of evolution** is a very compelling theory to explain how humans came to be. The problem I have with the theory of evolution is it’s assumption that human reasoning and human senses can be used to find objective truth. Let’s follow the logic that the theory of evolution proposes. 

*(If you’re an atheist and you believe that humans have a soul or consciousness or that theirs a higher power out there click here.)

**(I understand that there is a consensus in the scientific community that “evolution” is true but it’s semantics. Please focus on the argument I am presenting. )

In the beginning there was nothing. And then there was a cell. A simple cell that became more complex and eventually joined forces with other cells to created complex creatures. Creatures which lived and died and we are their descendants. These complex creatures survived in this world because they became good at surviving in it. They evolved methods of communication and methods of transportation. Lungs, gills, a heart, and brain all evolved because they were advantageous characteristics that allowed these complex animals to thrive in their environment. At the moment the prevalent theory is that humans evolved language and society as a means to survive. Language means we can communicate and form groups of complex animals that live in harmony and choose not to kill one another. I am of course presenting a simplified version of complex theories but my objection still stands. 

“In what way is knowing objective truth an advantageous charactarisitc?”

Of course you could just say, “ Evolution is not objective truth it is only subjective truth.” But by saying that you are discrediting yourself. You’re admitting you could be wrong. And that doubt should lead to agnosticism not atheism. 

Because the only thing atheists can really claim is that they evolved senses and human reasoning which lead them to believe that they evolved senses and human reasoning. This is clearly circular logic. 

I’m not even saying that the Christian God is the true God. I’m just making the claim that atheism is actually more illogical than agnosticism. I also encourage you to attempt to give a basis for why  human reasoning and human senses can  lead you to the truth. It’s something I think most humans believe instinctively. So you can either assume that instinct is simply a advantageous characteristic that humans evolved or that it is something more. I believe that human reasoning and human senses lead to God. I don’t think it’s illogical. I can also understand why some people believe they can’t possibly know the truth. There are a lot of contradicting religions out there. But what I could never understand is why people were atheists. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",1

Like a mushroom coming to the surface. In fact the mushroom is only the fleshy fruit body of the much bigger fungal network in the soil. If the mushroom gets eaten or cut off it doesn't affect the fungal network underground. Similarly we could be seen like a fruit growing out of this world. We identify with this ""fruit"" and we say we are a separate being. Therefore many people are terrified by the thought of death and disappearing into nothingness forever. Because we are just this little mushroom on the surface, isolated, fragile and helpless against all the predators and dangers, standing there alone not knowing where we came from and where we're heading, not knowing that we are connected with the giant fungal network in the ground, that we in fact are this whole network. 
Another example is golden jewelry. There are all kinds of forms, rings, chains, crosses etc. made from gold. But in fact the nature of all these different items is not its form but the gold itself. The form of the gold is just in our minds, our minds give meaning to it. But it can be molten and remodeled into other shapes and it remains just gold.

The state we are in now, thinking of ourselves as separate beings that have a start and an end, would be fake and the state after and before it would be the reality. So if that was true, the question of what happens after death would be irrelevant as we were never this separate being in the first place. One could say we were never born and will never die.",1
1582759386.0,The Music for Before We Were Born,"

Understanding evolution can terrify the individual, washing away all sense of purpose and amplifying the fatalism of misery. 
All of the intense suffering in history must be looked at from less of a worm, and more of an all encompassing/birds eye view. Like everything, suffering must be taken with a grain of salt. It is but a part of the game. 

Endless suffering with bouts of happiness; the inhalation and exhalation of something greater — the tempo of evolution and the experience of the living; whence a tendency towards greater complexity arose. 

Suffering is not a small fickle thing, but it is a great burden of which the small must carry; forever perpetuating something greater, and allowing for the existence of something now. 

Suffering is not a pointless toil; the race to stand still between the ever chasing fearful symmetry of the tiger and the graceful forever fleeing fear within the gazelle; this is but a recurrent experience in an ever receding arms race. It gives us the participants of now. It gives us the participants of tomorrow, and in it’s mindlessness it never ceases to leave history and experience behind it, with suffering and lover mingled two, both are to be taken from a birds-eye-view. 

Life not damned and life not loved, but life exists to all of the above. Through progress through pressure, through measure through pain; existence, existence, is never in vain. 

No God, nor jury to justify this fractal; 
nor are they necessary 
to live life not accidental.

Put terror in the void and leave less transcendental;
to put no reason behind the seasons might/may leave one existential. 

Lose pain, and lose also relief.
Lose tigers, and lose also gazelle.
Lose brutality, and lose also compassion.
Lose rape, and lose also consent.
Lose toil, and lose also serenity.

These pains are existent in the grandeur of this view of life.

I may not have the answers;
but then at least I have this.

The morbid textures of an anxious living mind; 

The hopelessness 
The unfairness

All tightly woven in this view of life, 
all brightly shone in yours and in mine

Gargantuan miseries in the small minds of these
participants, 
in a world never chosen, 
nor designed,
but necessary 
in this view of life
and in life
abundant 

Bleeding from your head and mine, 
and existence never chosen,
but given to me and to thee,
one in a trillion billion,
by slim chance and chance alone


To make sundry this life,
swindled by useless thoughts,
throwing away the chance to be,
the chance that was given
to thee and to me

So sing,
every mammal every fish,
every dolphin and monkey,
every aphid and donkey,
every humanoid and idiot tool,

Sing music for times before we were born,
as we ourselves will be but music.
Sing the melodies; and the musics of life, sing the catatonic tunes; and the misery and strife.

The tempo of evolved forms, circling an evolved star, in an ever-changing dance;
too real to be philosophically marred. (we cannot mentally mar, giving us a chance)

The music for before we were born
as music we will be soon after",1

1660045942.0,Negative causation.,"Negative causation.

Determinists – it seems – argue that everything has a cause, so there is no free will. Or rather they believe so. But they are blind, blind to negative causes. So while they say a gene, or society, one's upbringing will condition my and your actions, they ignore the negatives.

Let me explain, in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment the random emission of a subatomic event triggers or not the lethal poison. Triggers or not, so the cause of the cat's death (on observation) was the radioactive emission, so also then must be the non emission be the cause of its being alive.  

So the determinist maintains events cause my actions, but likewise non events must also. And at first this seems reasonable.

So the cause of my being here is that the Russians did not drop a nuclear device near by yesterday, and this morning the near by nuclear power station did no explode, or an airliner crash into my house...  I did not choke on my tea, a gas main didn't explode...
At first it might seem that there must be a very large but finite causes, negative causes, which lets me type this. Windows has not crashed, yet. The wireless router has not broken, or has my iSP gone down. However, as Prof John Barrow points out that the atoms in my chair do not all move to the left is due to randomness and probability.

”An inflationary universe could begin all over again for us. Yet more improbably, our entire Universe will have some minutely small probability of undergoing a quantum-transition into another type of universe. Any inhabitants of universes undergoing such radical reform will not survive.” 

Thus the cause of any event is infinite. It is not that one event or two account for it, but an infinity. And the negative causes are as significant as the positive, more so it seems. OK so is there then anything deterministic? if there is an infinite number of causes for any event. 

What this exposes is the bias of the determinists who, if they do, reject negative causation. A faith, not a reason. Otherwise the list of causal events is always infinite.  So their alternative when asked what caused that, is the answer that is an infinity of events. 
There is no one or finite cause.

And of course the cause of a non event likewise.

Why has politics become so extreme? I barely can go a day without checking the news, hoping to see something positive about the next election or justice being served to the former president.

And now I realize that the problem isn’t just about Trump winning, even if Democrats win for the next 20 years, the next time a Republican wins they will enact their so called “project 2025” plan. They just have to score once and the game ends. Why has the Republican Party become this way? 

Where is the empathy? Respect? Tolerance?

1673372180.0,Having Existential Dread Cause AI Might Automate My Passion As An Artist,"DO  NOT READ IF YOU ARE HAPPY AND WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. Most people  will probably scroll past this, or simply read the title and think “This  person’s being dramatic”. But for those who read and understand this  entire thing I’ve wrote, I applaud you. So here goes my long story about  how I’m afraid that AI might automate the one thing in life I really enjoyed, and thus made me question my purpose and existence.

Who am I? I’ll be  brief. I’m a 20 year old lady with mild Aspergers. Though you likely  would never guess. All my life I have navigated the world differently to  most. My passion throughout life has been artwork, animation and  cartoons. I love being able to essentially create life through drawings  and characters. And then bring further life to those characters by  making them move. I love making up my own worlds to go along with my  characters. I have several developing ideas for films, series and  shorts. All with concept art and scripts to go along with them. The  process is what I live for. I love it all. I’m not exaggerating when I  say it’s what I was meant to do. It gives this usually socially awkward,  sad and quiet lady something to pursue. And pursue I have. I have bean  learning since I was 12 and am currently entering the second year of my  Masters course.

That’s where this  whole AI art thing comes in. As an autist, I spend a lot of time on  computers. I know how they work. I knew they were powerful and could  process things quickly, but they themselves are not intelligent beings.  You can add a keyframe here and another there and have the computer  interoperate the motion in-between. The computer will do such in a very  mechanical way, lacking any creative thought.

I  have known about AI automation replacing jobs for years. And I was  scared. Even when it wasn’t affecting me. I knew it was never going to  be a good thing. But then I found out about Dall-E 2. You have probably  heard of this program already. To sum it up, it’s one of the few main AI  image generators out there. I was caught so off guard when I learnt of  it. How it was able to fill in the blanks and create things that  outright had never existed. It made more sense after I researched it’s  inner workings and found out about how it takes from datasets and then  gets ‘creative’ with the information it stored.

I’m  not going to get into the ethics of what I think about the AI’s  training method of scraping the internet for billions of copyrighted  images. That’s not the reason I’m writing this.

Why  I’m writing this is because I am genuinely afraid for not just my own  future, but that of humanity. Now the fear for my own future should be  obvious. These are computer programs that are creative. Something that  was thought to be unique to humans. They can generate 4K quality,  aesthetically pleasing artwork in seconds. I understand that the systems  have limitations. For now they seem to struggle with extreme  specifications. Sometimes they get things flat out wrong, like hands,  text or just the general composition. Most of these systems have  precautions in place to ensure they do not generate anything NSFW,  illegal or of a public figure. The images themselves also cannot be  copyrighted in many countries as the law states only human-made  creations can be copyrighted.

But  looking at the difference from the original Dall-E to Dall-E 2 a year  later, how long will it be before these limitations are overcome and far  surpassed? The potential, and likely impact of these programs has made me rethink everything about my existence, purpose and made me pretty depressed. I know  people saying that is overused these days, but I really do feel a deep  sense of emptiness and hopelessness.

What  does this mean for my future? These systems are already pretty good at  what they do and they will only continue to improve. Corporations will  no doubt jump over to using them instead of actual artists. It will  certainly decimate the freelancer scene too. Commissions will likely end  up mostly gone. Everyone will be capable of generating beautiful pieces  of art in seconds via a subscription to one of these systems. The  market will be super oversaturated. The process of making art will be  gone. Sure, I can still create art the way I have been, but that means  getting left in the dust. I could switch to using these systems, but  then the process of making something new is gone. That is what I love.  Even then, will anyone pay attention to my work when there’s millions of  equal quality images flooding their feeds? Some people may want to  support artists, but the vast majority of people won’t care or notice.  If artists like myself cannot support ourselves through art (Even as a  second job or side gig), then what do we do? Do we just get 9-5 jobs at  McDonalds and work our lives away? How long till that’s replaced by AI  too? It’s all very overwhelming to think about.

How do I feel about this? Heartbroken, dead inside, sad, anxious, any bad emotion you can think of.

I want to address some comments some people may have for me.

\- “You’re an animator. AI can’t animate”

Except  it can. AI generation systems for animation and videos already exist.  They may be janky, but at the rate the image generators have improved, I  say they will catch up. I fear I may also be out of a job in this field  too. Though maybe I have a few years before it happens.

\- “AI can’t write stories”

Actually,  it can. Look up Chat GPT. It can write entire movie scripts. You’ve  probably already seen an article somewhere that was written by a bot.

\- “You’re whining about nothing”

I’m  not whining, I’m just stating how I feel about this looming revolution.  I am not calling to tear down the companies that made these systems.  Notice how I skipped over talking about whether or not I think the way  these AI systems are trained is ethical. If I truly were whining then  this would have been a main talking point to try and demonize AI.

\- “AI art is just another tool”

Maybe  in it’s current form. But I know it will not stay this way for long.  It’s good for generating ideas. Though that already throws concept  artists out the window. AI art generators are not tools. They are  replacements. I have been ready to accept ever new art tool that has  come my way over the years. Pencils, MS Paint, Photoshop, Maya, Toon  Boom. I’ve embraced it all. I know the difference between a tool and a  replacement. Put it this way If you worked as a brick layer building  homes, you would accept ever new tool that was given to you. Concreate,  wheelbarrows, you name it. But if you showed up one day and saw a  machine laying all the bricks for you with extreme efficiency and speed,  you wouldn’t see it as a tool. You would see it as a replacement.

All  this has left me with an extreme sense of dread. What do I do now? How  much further will AI progress? One field AI is soon to take over is  driving vehicles. There’s no telling how many jobs this will cost. If AI  can take over artists, then it can take over basically anything. What  happens when the vast majority of us are unemployed with no way to  survive. (Maybe there will be some sort of Universal Basic Income, but  we’ll wait and see. It’s still a depressing thought.)

This  is different from other automation revolutions in the past. Art is  something people WANT to create. Something they want to pursue. It's one  of the things that make humans so fundamentally different from other  animals. It's existed since the beginning of human existence. To see it  now going the automated route is different. I feel as if this is just  one step closer to erasing what makes us human.

To  be honest, I don’t like the direction the world in general is going.  There’s big things like this, climate change, and overpopulation. Then  there’s smaller things such as cancel culture and political correctness  that weren’t here just a few years ago.

If  I’m real with myself, I feel a strong sense of Nihilism. I’m only 20. I  and all others my age are inheriting this broken world. Where we can’t  provide for our families or ourselves. Where our dreams are being  automated at mass scale. Where WW3 is growing more and more likely.  Where we’re spied upon every moment of our lives. I feel hopeless.

I  had dreams of having a couple of kids. But with everything that’s  happened the last few years, I don’t want to bring any more children  into this world. If I’m honest, I kind of wish I hadn’t been born. If I  didn’t exist then I wouldn’t have to float around as another unfortunate  victim caught up in this changing world. I’m  staying in this game, but I don't see a future where I, or the vast masses win.

I don’t know how exactly the future will pan out. But I am not optimistic.

1699139533.0,"If your depressed about existentialism, here is one solution that work for me","For years and really for a large part of life, existentialism has just bugged me. It has stopped me from doing things. It makes me question my reality. Questions like ""What is the purpose of life?"" or ""Why do we exist?"" etc. The answers I've always gotten were just null. And as a result, I have never derived joy, either a null state or just sadness. It has honestly just sucked all of the joy of life away from me. It has stopped me from doing my job, posting on social media and almost stopped me from finishing my education.

But my answer to existentialism is question: Why do we ask ourself these questions?

What purpose is there to answer these questions? It has severed no purpose but to put me in a metaphorical dark corner. All these idea of meaningless life, Sci-Fi books about human existence (especially the depressing ones), existence after death, etc. they don't do anything. They are a great talking point with some people who have this view but pondering these ideas and exploring these concepts don't give comfort. At the same time, it's not something that people want to talk about because its plain depressing. After sorta embracing this answer or questioning why I even think about it just gives me comfort. EDIT: I let my chain of though do their thing and it lets me release all of that pent up anxiety and really see life in a positive light 

TLDR: If you've accepted existentialism and it's had a difficult impact on your life, my answer to existentialism is just another rewording of many others in this subreddit: Just live in the present. When it does creep up from time to time, do not think about it but just question why you even thinking about (might take some mental conditioning). Go live life and experience things for better or for worse . Stop overthinking things. Just focusing on doing things and making existence if not better for yourself but others around you.

I recently was in my lit class one day, and I'm not sure what happened but I begun having some pretty deep existential thoughts. I have had these before, but not in this quantity/length. This is the picture of the essay/story/whatever, I apologize for the bad handwriting: [https://imgur.com/a/XscuJXi](https://imgur.com/a/XscuJXi)

I'm not sure why I wrote this, to be honest. This is pretty angry sounding though, so yeah. 

Here is text for those that cannot read my very bad handwriting: 

 What is the purpose of this futile existence? Merely to spend a century trapped on  
this planet? Why are we here in the first place? Is there really nothing more to see, to find? I can already see my entire life in front of me. Graduate. Job. Marry. Kids. Die. This is it. Why is there nothing else? Where we only meant to survive, reproduce and die knowing that we achieved nothing, knowing that our lives meant nothing to the endless stars that shine above us? Do not tell me that our purpose was to be happy, to live a life full of  ""happiness"". How can this cycle go on? No. I must find a way. I must find a way to find more to what here is because there must be. I feel no joy knowing that I I can predict my entire life already. Who gives a shit if I live a long healthy prosperous life? In the end, we are all forgotten and any trace of our existence will be wiped from this Earth. The idiotic, insignificant worries of those around me drive me insane, because who cares? In a decade, in a second, will what you say be worth anything, worth a second of attention from us? Maybe. Maybe not. Those who say  
that there is more with faith, within a ""God"" only believe this false idea to fool themselves into the belief that they are worth something. There is no God wo looks down on us, Religion was an idea crafted by man to calm himself down, to tell himself that he had a purpose, that somebody meant for Man to do something. This fantasy cannot be further from the truth. Ugh. I ask myself to put things into perspective. Instead I ramble on about random ideas, except that it isn't random. I need someone to tell me, tell me why we are here. Tell me why this is worth it. tell me why our effort will ever matter. But I already know the answer. Our existence as a race is meaningless, we can only look up and see how tiny will continue how small, how stupidly insignificant we are. This endless cycle of foreverness, after we are gone, after the world has rid itself the plague that we call humanity. Not the it matters.",1

1660878347.0,"If you clone someone and the original person dies, are they still technically alive in some way?","In the Borderlands games (don't worry I won't give any spoilers), when you die, a New-U Station creates a whole new clone of you using stored DNA and you continue playing as that clone (the Machine takes some money out of your bank account. Well, I guess technically that would be the last clone's bank account).

The game and the machine have all these subtle (and not-so-subtle)  jokes regarding how weird it is that you're technically dead but your consciousness, your essence, is still alive in a way.

""*So, how was the dying?""*

""*Hyperion would like to remind you that there is only one thing worse than respawning, and that is not respawning.""*

*""If any idiot ever tells you that life would be meaningless without death, Hyperion recommends killing them.""*

""*Hyperion wants you to know: death is not the end. Bankruptcy is!""*

""*By using New-U, you forfeit all rights to your life story to Hyperion. Until your story is profitable, it's not over.""*

Since your old clone's memories are stored and placed into the new clone you're continuing from where you left off, so I often completely forget that I'm technically playing as a different person after each death. But *are* you even a different person? If multiple clones of you were alive at the same time, for instance, would you have a shared consciousness with them? Like some kind of computer network?

I've tried to read more literature about existentialism but I guess I'm better with reflection and analysis myself than I am with reading the scholars on the topic. In other words, the heavy psychology-specific terminology mixed with typical literary lingo puts my ass straight to sleep. 


I used to be different. You know, believe in different things, think there was some greater meaning. The shift started with the idea of karma. Bad guys getting their comeuppance, good things going to good people. I would notice reality didn't support that but then immediately force the thought straight out. 


Then, ya know, upheaval. Depression. Confusion. After thinking about it more and more and the intricacies behind what should be and what shouldn't, coming to the conclusion that it's all make believe was a lot to stomach. It was after a long while of being in that hole when I finally started allowing myself to understand. 


I'm ok now. When I started feeling shitty again, I Googled something like, ""Why can't I accept some things about life,"" or, ""Why do I feel lost?"" Viola. I knew what existential dread was but not existentialism. It's super cliché but knowing this is a thing made it not feel so much like my life was coming apart. 


I still kind of feel like I'm on an island by myself, everyone else being just out of reach and barely able to hear me. But I'm pretty ok with it all. Even if it's forever.

One person in the comments said this:
>Existentialism: life is inherently meaningless therefore it is up to us to give life meaning (paraphrased from Sartre). 
>Nihilism: life is inherently meaningless and any meaning we give to life is equally meaningless

Whats more frustrating is that the [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/8ck04m/regarding_the_authenticity_of_this_subreddit/?utm_source=reddit-android) on this sub addresses this clearly yet people continue to make the same mistakes.

I've seen these definitions continue to be parroted. For some reason people view nihilism and existentialism as two mutually exclusive things. Simply wikipedia these two things and you'll notice something important. Wikipedia calls nihilism a ""doctrine"" and ""philosophical viewpoint."" Existentialism is defined as ""a tradition of philosophical inquiry.""

In other words nihilism is a philosophical tenant one can hold while existentialism is a way of philosophizing. Yes, you can believe in nihilism and be an existentialist.

I think existentialism can be best understood by understanding what makes it different from other philosophies:
>What makes this current of inquiry distinct is not its concern with “existence” in general, but rather its claim that thinking about human existence requires new categories not found in the conceptual repertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings can be understood neither as substances with fixed properties, nor as subjects interacting with a world of objects.

Does existentialism say that ""life is meaningless but we should make our own meaning?"" A lot of people say that it does but the answer is no, that's what a Sartre says. That is AN existentialist statement but not the only one there is.

Sartre believed meaning was a choice, we are radically free to be whatever hence the line ""man is condemned to be free"" that I'm sure everyone here is all too aware of. 

But have you heard the phrase ""we are condemned to meaning?"" Those words were a swipe at Sartre written by Merleau-Ponty, another seminal figure in existential philosophy. 

Putting this in context, this means we shouldn't just create meaning in our lives. You are CONDEMNED to it! Meaning is something you have whether you like it or not. This is no less ""existentialist.""

You dont have to agree with Ponty or Sartre. There are so many other existentialist philosophers and they have all their own things to say like Jaspers, Arendt, Marcel, etc., and you can agree or disagree with any and all of them. ",1

1484114291.0,Remember that there is always choice,"Earlier today I made a post about my terror at the thought of personal identity being a myth and how we can only delay our ultimate death.
I won't say these statements are incorrect in fact, but are completely the absolute worst way to live through life.
Existentialism can both be freeing and enslaving. We stumbled across the fact that our past truths were myths meant to comfort and preserve. When these myths - religious or metaphysical - are torn down, you can choose to rebuild life and embrace the beautiful, or you can become lost in the coming emptiness.
An existential crisis is by far the most profound event in one's life. It changes everything. When this crisis first occurred for me a few days ago (my first true realization of existentialism's consequences), I felt lost and depressed, confused by the senselessness of it all. I wish I could turn things back but that cannot happen. If I am not to succumb to these dark thoughts, I must rebuild my reality. I can dwell on what will come or I can appreciate the moment I am currently experiencing.
This affirmation of these few moments we have must be fought for. It is a fight against pessimism that I don't think will truly end. Take advantage of this community of people experiencing something similar to what you're experiencing now. Read the literature that addresses this reality (I don't want to call it a problem as existentialism may also be a solution). More importantly, talk to your friends; smile and laugh; listen to music that inspires you.
I will never conquer these dark thoughts totally, but I can challenge these thoughts with values of my own. I hope my future-self the best of luck in this ordeal. For maybe the first time I see the world as it really is and it's both horrific and amazing.

-T Your conciousness is an emergent property of said process.

-T Fundamentally you have experience of continuous existence.

1378105677.0,Does anyone think Nihilism and Existentialism are essentially worthless with modern neuroscience?,"Forgive me, because I don't think I'll explain this the way I want to.

Existentialism always asks the question: ""What is meaningful and why? Why do one thing over another? How do I deal with existance?""

Modern neuroscience tells you the how and why. Sisyphus is happy pushing the boulder up the hill because he gets a dopamine release. Dopamine causes seeking tendencies that make him do the work.

In my mind, after Sisyphus gets his dopamine, he *retroactively* decides that he can justify his work with some extensive philosophy like absurdism and that he's ""creating his own meaning"" etc.

In short, it seems like this whole branch of philosophy is a phenomonological account of neuroscience. If you look down at your work and say ""Why am I doing work? What the point of being hungry? What's the point of not dying? What does ""the point"" even mean?"" You're asking the wrong school of thought.

""Why am I doing the work?"" is answered by, ""Because your brain is constructed in such a way that it releases chemicals that create seeking behavior towards your current activities and/or the activities you think will come about as a reward for your current activities.

""Why am I doing the work?"" is answered less satisfactorally, and to me in a seemingly ad hoc way, by ""Because you are creating meaning in a meaningless world due to your freedom to rebel absurdly.""",1
1500947201.0,"Hi, I'm an existential nihilist who finds reincarnation incredibly plausible","Sometimes I feel like I'm torturing myself to feel that all of *this* (waves hands around) never ends and that ""we"" constantly go through a never ending cycle of birth and death, and none of it means anything at all. There's no end goal, there's no meaning, the only meaning is that which you decide to create for yourself and sort of stick onto existence. Everything has been going on forever, there is no end, there wasn't a beginning, and it's all just a big, weird, carousel ride. 

**Reincarnation can probably go a few ways:**

1) The Hindus, Buddhists, and spiritual new agers were right, and every incarnation is based on your last incarnation so that you can sort of... live off all that ""karmic debt"". If that's true, then it's weird as hell because there's a nonsensical transcendent game that we're all playing, and we apply some sort of ""meaning"" to it, but it's all just cyclical, meaningless, fucking around. It's a joke.

2) The mediums and psychics were right, every incarnation was your choice, so that you can learn about some sort of shit to help you ""grow"" to wherever your ""soul"" wanted to grow. You're amnesiac to this fact though because then it makes life more challenging, but it's still some meaningless fuckery, even if it's your ""soul's path"". If you even have a soul, your soul supposedly chose a path to make existence more interesting, and it most likely already knows that all this shit is meaningless in the end. We play these little life games for pure, pointless entertainment.

3) This is what I view to be the most plausible, but then again I'll never know until I die. Firstly you have to consider that ""we"" are just voids before we're born, and when we die. Like, some can consider this the ""nothingness"" part of consciousness... but there's no name for it, it's literally just a void. A void is nothing until it spontaneously pops into existence as some sort of living entity, and if it somehow ends up in a human body, maybe even several times in a row, then the void isn't a void anymore during those moments of living, it becomes a character, a personality, an expression. And then the void which becomes a ""you"" or an ""I"" does all this pointless shit, whether that be believing in a God or praising Satan or meditating for hours to attain some sort of nirvana or whatever other practices you decide to practice, and then you die, only to become void again, where ""you"" came from in the first place, and after a period of timelessness, **pop**, back into existence you go.

And this never ends. It's been going on forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and it doesn't matter what you believe in or what you do, life is just a meaningless fireworks display, and all the colors and sparks are your expressions and beliefs and ""Truths"" that you apply to this thing called existence - including the nihilistic and existentialist views - and then you forget about it all. 

And I have no idea why, but I find some tremendous comfort in this thought, which is weird seeing as nihilism and existentialism is supposed to be angsty and uncomfortable. But simultaneously, there are people who get fucked up over the possibility that everything is infinite, that there's no end. 

You can apply whatever viewpoint you want on the universe, but all it is is an act of pointless expression, and will not mean anything when you're dead, and then you repeat. And all you can really ever do is whatever you want to do. 

I'd like to hear other's viewpoints on this. If you have an argument against my view, I'd be more than willing to take it in.",1

1649708747.0,Existentialism Is Nihilism - a response,"Or, rather, the deffinitions of nihilism and existentialism are deeply interconnected.

If during your life you decide to spend Time and Thought on philosophy - and if you decide also to do so in an honest way, choosing to pursue understanding and comprehension above reaffirmation of your beliefs - then you are likely come across the following 3 terms: Nihilism. Existentialism. and Absurdism.   
As you read through and listen to the thoughts of the dead - you are likely to encounter differing takes on these concepts, some admirable and well thought out, while others prove reactionary and unexamined.   
In the following minutes it is my goal to highlight to you how these concepts internink, and how in their interlinked nature, provide a profound framework for understanding realities core to the human experience, and more importantly, the fundamental actuality of the larger ideas they represent.

\----------------------------------------------  
Existentialism can be thought of as the reasoned pursuit of meaning - the endeavor to devise systems of value of one’s own making - from a perspective at terms with certain realities of our situation.  
For example,  the reality that we must generate our own reasoned values for them to be in any sense “meaningful”, and that in this we are “damned to be free”.  
At its core, existentialism seeks to tackle the questions of what in life is to be valued from a perspective at terms with the reality of death.  
At terms with the obvious and apparent suffering inherent to the human condition.  
The existentialist sees these realities and establishes their meaning in relation to them.  
In acceptance and awareness of them, such that it frames their systems of value.  


The existentialist tends towards advocating for self reasoned values over groupthink or adherence to traditional beliefs and established value structures of the past  


\-----------------------------  
Nihilism is the word for the realization that meaning is a phenomena of mind. That beyond the context of the mind itself, phenomena such as morality, value, love, pain - all of it - lacks foundation, and therefore becomes meaningless.  
Nihilism is acknowledging the mind itself as being the only and actual foundation of meaning, in contrast to the thoughtless abyss that surrounds in both space and time.  


You will more often than not hear this term used in pessimistic fatalistic sense. Like the post i am writing this in response to.   
This approach however seems keen to focus on the part where meaning does not exist beyond us, rather than the profound truth that meaning has only ever been of us.  


There’s also nihilistic optimism. Which is focused more on the positive implications of oblivion. Like guilt and regret losing the weight they hold on one’s being. As well as a recontextualizing of one’s values. However, upon further definition the position becomes what is essentially existentialism (making values in contrast to the void). So i find the use of the term limiting. It also focuses on one side of it, like the mainstream pessimistic take.  
The fact of the matter is that nihilism is the word used for the realization that meaning is - and has only ever been - a phenomena of mind.  


\-------------------  


Absurdism, is a funny one. (ha)  


Absurdism can be summed in part as an awareness of the inherent ridiculousness - the utter absurdity - of nearly every aspect of being, and indeed of being itself.  


But there’s a heavier more brutal dimension to it, in relation to the concepts discussed. To be an absurdist in the philosophical sense is to recognize the violent humor within the contrast between the existentialist pursuit, and the nihilistic reality. That we create, generate, hold to and value meaning - despite it not existing anywhere but in the act of its affirmation.   


Absurdism is in the fact that the universe doesnt seem to care, or to be capable of caring.  


It’s in the Utter Comedy of the foundations of most systems of value or of meaning - and the dark humor in the reality that we minds rise from the abyss - barely come to comprehend it, if we even dare try - only to then be swallowed back up again into the infinite thoughtless void from which we emerged.  


Absurdism is the insane laughter at the endless void to come- at the attempts to deny its overbearing reality -and at ever having had existed at all.---------All three of these domains of thought arise from the same fundamental philosophical approach, almost as an inevitability.  


This approach, is that of those who endeavor to face life honestly, and to endure the understandings that honesty reveals.  


\-------

So, you see, while existentialism is not nihilism, in talking of one we inevitably talk of the other.  


  


The nihilist highlights the reality of the subjective nature of meaning, and the void that surrounds.  


The existentialist pursues and seeks to generate meaning by virtue of an honest awareness of what it is to Be.  


And The absurdist laughs

1633164110.0,My negative view on this World,"I don’t know where to start, but there are so many wrong things with the world as of today. Some of these examples are the broadening of the mind and discussions are being held back due to political correctness, interesting topics and discussion being censored in movies, people are being too emotional and make the incorrect decisions, and many more. 

It’s as if the world around me is falling apart as I try to live my own life. I felt as if the failings of this world needs to be catalyzed and we’ll restart over again. And if you think about it, our lives are pretty much useless when you see the grand scope of things. If I or anyone were to die right now or maybe even the next day nothing that we do (good or bad) will remembered by society and the world at large. So it’s much easier, now, to be called a villain by society by inacting logical thinking and bring out sensitive discussions rather than to blend in with the political correctness that this world evolved to. Moreover, catalyzing the end of the world by erasing humanitu to create anew seems more promising than what we are heading towards nowadays.

I might even hate humanity. I don’t know. Do I hate it? In many aspects yes. Do I love it? When it does good of course. But, I’ve seen too many of the bad happening while the good is set aside and villified. I do not know how to see this in a different light. I’ve been told just to “have faith” or “believe in the good” but am I really going to have faith to the shittiness that is happening around the world? If any of you have a different perspective of this, I would like you to help enlighten me and maybe, even, restore that “faith” or “goodness” inside of people with similar mindset.

PS: If you said that the world today is better than a hundred years back I agree with that 100% so that’s why I would argue that if 100 years back was worse, then destroying the world back then and today is alright too. It was bad 100 years back, it’s better now, but we’re heading towards some more tomfoolery that will poison the generations to come, cycling that crappy 100 years.",1

1599808455.0,New to the community. Just an opening thought.,"Existence like every thing else we know is a word we created that represents an idea that we define then refine through reflection. We can’t say we don’t exist because here we are. Are we imagining this? Living in a simulation? Is my mind all that exists? These are all cool ideas but does that make life meaningless?

In the same way a molecule can be isolated, broken into atoms and we infinitely search for a base. We can look at any religion, ideology, self-defined purpose and never find the base meaning. You will always find a deeper “why” to your meaning. 

So what is the meaning of life? To really ask this question then remove ego. Do not ask what is the meaning of “my” life. Ask what is the meaning of life as a whole. From its inception to its highest forms. Life is growth and evolution, becoming more resilient, unlocking higher forms of thought and a deeper appreciation for the experience of those higher conceptual creations.

Bacteria only feeds and multiplies. Reptiles perceive experience through primitive emotion to assist survival instincts. More developed animals form communities and affectionately bond. Only we as humans appreciate art, music, meaning, and the intricate structure of our reality enough to contemplate the infinite possibilities of its interpretations. 

The meaning of existence? Through all the layers you will always arrive at “yeah, but why?”. The meaning of life? Grow. Evolve. Appreciate the beauty of whatever idea you can contemplate to its highest form. Then go higher.",1

But when I really think about this I realise just how f\*\*\*ing scary that really is. I'd just never be able to do anything and I just really struggle to even think about what that kind of thing would be like, like a dreamless sleep, not even that, a sensationless sleep, no feel of warmth or cold or touch or breathing. I would love to try and maybe be in a sensory deprivation chamber to maybe get the slightest idea of what it would be like as far as external senses go, not really sure how to try and simulate lack of dreams and brain function I guess.

I digress, death is kinda scary as hell. I will never be able to do anything and i'd just have to 'not' and I kind of feel like this is how religions' depictions of afterlife began, with people being a bit scared of what the lack of life may hold so they decide to do something else and think up of something to alleviate their minds of this immense feeling of dread and fear (plus a dash of curiosity) that i am currently experiencing late at night.

Sorry this was kind of a train of thought rant but i just needed to get that out my brain, how do you guys feel about the whole nothing after death thing, do you fear it at all? and for the believers, how do you feel about the afterlife that you believe in, may it be a heaven or hell, reincarnation and so on, let me know i'd love to hear some of the outlooks and thoughts of other people out there.",1

1703959497.0,Existentialism Theory of Everything vs. Nothing,"I'd like to try to explain a theory of existence that I've been kicking around in my head, and I will do my best to explain it.

Simply, we exist because we have to. Because at the very base of everything is the fact that there is either existence or non-existence. There are the mathematical expressions (forgive me, I will not use the correct mathematical terminology, as I am not an expert in math, or existentialism, or anything related - these are just my ideas) for ZERO, and then anything but zero. There's Yin and Yang, positive and negative, etc. We exist because there IS and because there is NOT. What I mean by that, is the moment there became anything positive or negative, observable or non-observable, with or without matter or energy, there instantaneously became something that is either negative or positive. I believe this is fairly well supported in math and that most proven theories have a counterpart in mathematics. Afterall, there cannot be something if there is no such thing as nothing. 

Last night, I was watching an episode of ""Under the Dome"", and I started wondering to myself what side of the dome would be more affected by the fact that these people were stuck in a dome with no communication. Would the impact of such a situation be greater on these people inside the dome or outside the dome? Mathematically, there is far more outside of that point in space-time than there is inside, so wouldn't it be safe to assume that the greater effect is on what is outside of the dome? We can call this dark matter or dark energy in this theory. 

https://preview.redd.it/2u9e2l5b2h9c1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=083c967606055d8def2d907109410748e86bd9a8

**My theory is that we exist at the intersection of oneness, and nothingness, and that everything we see, feel, observe, etc. is all a result of those two universal forces pulling on each other.** 

I think that the thing that we should be doing our best to understand and map is the **nothing**, the zero, the anti-matter, the anti-anything. For example, at any given point in space time, there may be something observable or there may be nothing. If we are considering that which is observed, I think we need to only look at what ISNT observable. The Yang, the negative, the infinite. That is where the math stops because we cannot breach that terminal line in space and time. We only call it dark matter or dark energy. What if we were able to plot everything that ISNT at a given point in space time (I know the math would be unimaginable large and require more computing power than is likely possible)? 

Basically, what I'm saying, is the REAL is everything that we currently perceive as not. Imagine taking a very large, very intricate black and white picture, where most of the picture is black, but there is an obvious observable image made of up white pixels. Now, take that picture and invert the colors so that everything that was previously black is white and vice-versa. Now, do this with everything that is observable in the universe at a given point in space and time. Everything would assume it's mathematical or observable opposite and THAT is what we would look at. Blues would be orange, blacks would be white, reds would be green and so on, but with ***everything***. something that would be classified as a 2 would be a -2. Everything with matter (or mass) would be measured as the complete opposite. Something that appeared as having zero matter, zero energy, or zero mass would be measured as having infinite matter, mass, or energy. Do this with everything and map it. I know, it's a lot, but the universe is a big thing. 

This is why I tend to believe that we are a program. The reason there is unobservable anything is because it's on the other side of what is ""real"" and what is programmed"". Because of this terminal point in space/time, we can and will never be able to observe anything on the other side. It's written into the coding at the very beginning and acts (through mathematics) as a boundary that cannot be crossed. It will never matter how much progress we make in the sciences of gravity, light, or other fundamental forces because they are all, at one point, even if VERY difficult, observable. They're observable because they are of the basic coding/building blocks of our ""existence"". I would even venture to guess that we are ""alien"" or ""viral"" lines of code. Self-replicating, quickly spreading, malignant-at-times, lines of code that have the ability to destroy or create other like code. I believe that when UAPs, religious, biblical, and other instances of ""seemingly impossible"" or other-worldly occurrences have happened is due to active interference by a force capable of changing our coding or the coding of the ""world"" we live in. These things are being coded into existence and then ""displayed"" for us through our abilities to observe in order to push civilization in one way or another. This active interference is more of a reason to consider that we may be a program. Is it more likely that aliens from outer space are coming to visit us, or is it more likely that whatever we are witnessing (more often than ever before) is something that's already here, overlaid on top of our existence, but on the other side of the mathematical wall that prevents us from observing them? I think that's where the ""real"" in the universe exists and that we are only lines of code. 

We've all heard the Ufologists talk about, ""What could be so dark that they refuse to let the world know?"" Well, think about it for a moment. Imagine that scientists were able to confidently discern that we were almost certainly programmed into existence? What if our purpose was simple to be the oil in a machine? How would people feel about knowing that another force could end us instantly at any time? What if what seems like an eternity to humans (thousands even millions of years) is experienced to our creators in the same way that we experience hours? What if the end of our civilization was determined simply by when our programmers become bored of their latest hobby? I think this is one of the darker paths that have been postulated and I think it's dark enough for a secret to be kept.

1703212411.0,Consciousness After Death...?,"This idea came up to me after I had a quick conversation with my grandma. Her dementia hasn't gotten any better, and it's quick to notice her deteriorating state after asking the same questions moments prior. After she left, I began to ponder what it means to think and ""see"" things. I recalled a previous situation I thought of regarding an inebriated person. The idea goes like this:

""You can only see things as they are in the present, only because you'll remember them in the future""

Say you were utterly drunk, and the next day, you woke up in someone else's room with entirely different clothes. You ask your sober friends what happened, and they recall stating that you went absolutely wild, and trashed the whole place. To you, you were utterly oblivious. You had no recollection, you didn't consciously ""see"" any of the events unfold. It was as if you were accelerated to the future without knowing what happened prior. This effect is even further noticeable if someone suffers from total amnesia. To them, they were suddenly in the body of (say) a 26 year old. It was as if they were born that way. It's because they never remembered what they did prior to contracting amnesia, it was as if they never ""saw"" the things happen at all. 

So, what does this have to do with my theory. Well, considering death is the total loss of life, where everything from your senses, to your consciousness AND your memory is erased, shouldn't we have already accelerated to that point? Like if we are all going to die anyway, why haven't we accelerated in that point in time when all our memories will be lost. Yet, we don't, and maybe the possible reason for it is that, we still have consciousness, in whatever form. Consciousness that allows us to see, but more importantly, one that allows us to remember.",1

1699515717.0,Simulation Theory is taking the metaphor too literally,"Are you able to discern the difference between a dream and the waking world? Sure the surreality of your dreams or worst nightmares from a limited subjective perspective given an actuality into the world we all share may inspire a dreamlike surreality uncanny atmosphere that makes mundane moments seem poetic and given impossible amount of importance.

I have suspected that misinformation is fed to examine from a sociological level it’s spread digestion and acceptance as truth to a discernible level to the average citizen for the security of the fate of mankind and not its downfall when it’s safest and before it is absolutely vital to have mastered the almost impossible task of pursuing an objective standard while only being able to perceive your own subjective point of view.

In a dream you are clouded with a narrow realm of thought and perspective so much so it’s unlikely you are aware at the time that life does not add up to coherence beyond a sort of visceral or symbolic metaphorical experience that pushes a sort of deeper truth into your gut that you can’t shake off once your waking self is aware that in the dream world there is absolutely no sense of continued narrative experienced linearly with a few fade to blacks for sleepy time. There is so much more detail and critcal thought and fullness in reality than the place where the metaphor is the message but not the existence that exits within the world outside our physical bodies and minds that we sense and even feel and even intuit or use a kind of God given sixth sense.

Everything is an influence on its immediate surroundings as Newton said every action has an equal reaction either physical spiritual or through karma across the universe bending reality to its influence. It almost seems as if we’re slaves to the first uncaused cause or the prime mover or the unmoved mover, as the domino theory or butterfly effect would articulate but we choose how we communicate or utilize or redirect that energy that can not be destroyed but pointed. To me free will is fundamental and sometimes in the best case scenario is the highest hope that a divine power could trace or your acceptance and choice and objective succeess at least chasing an impossible expectation. At least that is what I hope. To me to will happiness and joy and fullness of life to those that love you truly and not with false pretenses but with the true hard reality of true love is not chains but an enjoyment and a learning experience.

To go a little deeper into some of my esoteric thoughts. Dark matter is the physical weight of spiritual invisible God, and it our belief and our virtues that strengthen him in an almost all powerful but objectively more than we could ever grasp. 

Whatever is behind this universe that kind of crafted this one is not Windows 95 but some fundamental force like chaos that willed its existence from complete nothingness that some intelligent design from pure accident of uninfluenced randomness experienced a glimpse of a song or melody so beautiful it gave purpose to all that sufffering that is fundamentally more likely in complete chaos than a perfectly tuned universe. That reality is not more real than the reality we exist in but must be at the very least in a much emptier space where the fundamental powers take complete focus to control and is more like wind or electricity or cosmic fog.

A bit of a physical/metaphysical question.

In our Universe, if we can colonize the galaxy and unite in a hive mind and combat the laws of thermodynamics so we can exist forever, recycling matter/energy and avoiding the heat death of the Universe - then we would achieve the Absolute. However, physicists say that this would be impossible.

Can realities exist with less restrictive laws of nature (but still mathematically valid) that would allow for an Absolute to form and exist indefinitely? This would practically equal God.

If there are other universes that were there for like 10^10000000000 years, maybe some of them reached an Absolute state (if the laws of reality even allow it).",1

One can easily observe the organized and intelligent design of the world around. The truth seems to be that despite the superior strength of goodness’ power, it couldn’t prevent inferior evil from ever having an impact on life/existence. Seems grim, but you’ve probably experienced that things or even people have died off over time. This is the way that life/existence would become perfect/flawless again: the evil that forced its way in would eventually fade away. Who you can call a Deity (masterful Angel or similar idea) obviously began life/existence supernaturally, but then something like an unavoidable pest attack arose and the situation was and is still being handled as EFFICIENTLY as possible.

Life today certainly has secrets. The common pattern is like a repetitive cycle that either brings satisfaction or not.

1678700841.0,"In the story of why, we get lost in the herd","Whenever we ask _why_ we did something, the story that follows seems to depend on the narrative or appraisal we have in mind. For example, _why am I writing this?:_

* because ""I want to"" -- story of _desire;_
* because ""I need to"" -- story of _necessity;_
* because ""they said to"" -- story of _deference;_
* because ""it's our culture"" -- story of _conformity;_
* because ""it's right or good"" -- story of _acceptability;_
* because ""my nature beckons me"" -- story of _instinct;_
* because ""my brain sent the signals"" -- story of _causation;_

Naturally, multiple of the above could be selected as equally valid for a given action. That the interpretation of our action should be so dynamic and arbitrary suggests that perhaps reason is only a social construct. One might even say that expressions of reason are primarily given to convey accord between our actions and the sanctioned symbols of shared value. In this way, our stories are often devised as tickets, or passes, within the halls of society. Even the stories we tell ourselves are there largely to fit us into the cultural Zeitgeist.

As such, what we _tell_ ourselves, what we believe ourselves to _be,_ and to be _doing,_ is largely a product of the hive. Language is inherently social. That is, language is a _social animal._ For many, this animal plays automatically within us and through us, keeping the hive in order. Because its feathers and fur appear so intimately within our phenomenal consciousness, we may interpret this social critter as being of our personal making. We may even think our stories as our own.

If words are stories, and stories are arbitrary, and stories are social constructs, then where is the person? Is it the timeline, the body, the feeling?

Considering the arbitrary nature of interpreting the timeline, one may question the meaning or legitimacy of any such narrative. Even the future is only a tale of society's tether -- ever seeking to fulfill the hive. On the other paw, recall of individual images and sensations may have more merit. What we feel and sense now may be the only truth. And its later recall, though perhaps filtered and decayed, may be the next closest truth we have.

Sometimes we become lost in the story, but fortunately we need not remain fixated on pretentious intent. There exists a place where words go to bed. Why not take a moment to feel the only truth we get?",1

1649509814.0,Conscious consciousness consciously contemplating consciousness,"Consciousness is the Preexisting, Permeating, and Indwelling Eternal Awareness & Imagination which exists outside of Time and Space. Information/Data is the unfathomably tiny spec(Singularity/Whitehole/Bigbang) that which formed after the previous Universe condensed into itself via a Blackhole.  

  The more things created within the Universe the more information is generated.The more population goes up, the more Information is generated, which is why the Universe expands. Information is the missing 95% of the Universe. Consciousness/Awareness(God if you believe) has always and will always exist. 

  This Eternal Consciousness is what generated the first Field. The Field generated the Higgs Boson(God Particle) which became the ""Big Bang"". That dinky, tiny particle contained all Mass in the Universe. Imagine a balloon with a Universe drawn on it,  then imagine it being filled with air and how everything spreads out away from one another equally. That is our Universe and all the contents within. 

  EVERYTHING of Matter only has Mass thanks to the Higgs Boson (God Particle). Without it we would not exist the way we do now. 

Our brains are Matter, which means the brains gained their Mass from the God Particle. 

  ""While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE
    ALL is in ALL. To him who truly understands this
    truth hath come great knowledge.""--The Kybalion

We exist within THE ALL, and the ALL exists within us as the God Particle (Higgs Boson).

  They are currently proving that Information is the fifth state of Matter because it contains Mass. Information comes in the form of a special type of Photon. All actions, thoughts, imaginations, creations, etc all generate Information into the Universe, and it is now almost able to be detected.",1

1647984107.0,Share your thoughts!,"I basically began writing in quarantine, took an escape to existential thoughts as a way to make problems around me seemingly insignificant in comparison. Thought I should take down all this mess and I got carried away and wrote things I really never knew were at the back of my head. Ive only just begun to try and structure it to a point where it's firstly more accessible and satisfying for me to come back to and read. Also to possibly expand and make it a project of mine to get more in-depth and more focused on a reader or audience base. I need someone with a deep interest in the philosophy of existential thought to read and make a judgement on, not necessarily in an academic or professional manner but one just sharing their own thoughts with me, how they view my take on it and a good way I can proceed. I'm open ears for anyone :) Also new to this subreddit and just happy to be in a space with like-minded people, which is one of the reasons I reached out here. Not a lot of people to relate to this around me. Please reply or DM me directly, would love to hear from you! :)",1
1645370788.0,A Griddle Reminded Me,"I woke up this morning mad as hell at my husband for what he said last night.. as I cleaned the kitchen as time and time again I forgot to empty the grease tray on my favorite griddle after making a home cooked chicken meal the night before...I picked it up to wash it and juices from the chicken went everywhere. On the countertops, the floor, my boots, and even on the plated pizza my husband just fixed himself. I wasn't upset about it, I knew I'd clean it up, we had plenty more pizza, and I'd probably forget again. It's just me, just something I did... but the words he said upset me.. he proclaimed that I must be too incompetent to use such a thing if I can't remember to empty the grease tray. I profusely apologized and reiterated I truthfully forgot. He then stormed in and grabbed his plate threw it in the garbage and scolded me like a child.. I pleaded for him to please stop and I'm sorry, but I can't tolerate the behavior he is giving me. He didn't. I grabbed my coat and went to my car, as I sat there I realized I left my keys inside. I couldn't muster the thought of going back in because I knew I'd face him again. Instead, I sat there... in 35 degree weather with winds blowing 20+ an hour.. I wasn't sure what I would do. Call a friend.. no... grab my keys and leave my kids to deal with the aftermath of his rage.. no... I sat frozen for an hour and when my toes and nose couldn't tolerate the cold anymore... I retreated inside. I said nothing and grabbed the griddle chucked in the garbage and told him.. ""I'm too incompetent to use this and now I won't and I won't ever forgot to empty the grease tray again. My favorite thing to cook with and now it's garbage. I hope you're happy now."" I stormed to the bedroom and revoked all my plans and invitations for us the next day. I didn't want to see him that night or the next day. I stated he can keep his apologies because I don't accept them and do not talk to me.. I feel asleep hurt and angry.. I woke up the same way. I wouldn't breath a word to him.. he did the same. Until he decided to softly ask me, ""Do we have any walnuts around here?"" I assume the question was for himself to fix his own breakfast. I replied, ""I'm still angry at you. Don't talk to me. I'm ready for you to leave."" He didn't respond... I assume he didn't locate the walnuts and now he's moved on to fixing a breakfast for the household.. I won't be eating. Call me childish, call me overactive... over the years his angry and hatred has grown and he blames me. Maybe it is my fault.... I've offered a divorce many times. He won't. He's afraid to be alone, to do life alone, so he deals with it. That's the life... 'deal with your wife and live a barely sufficient life'. Life has made me so bitter, cold, tired... sometimes I don't know if I'm going to make it. I feel solace when I think, ""only 1 more year, only 5 more years to go."" An end in sight, something to end this..,""is life really that awful? All you see the bad, never the good."" It's true, I don't. The bad overshadows the good everyday in my eyes. I struggle to see the positive in most situations. I feel I move with the motions to appear happy and normal. I'm not. I'm not happy or normal. What even is that anyway? I think some are just better at playing the game than others... I feel I used to be really good at it. I'm noticing with age and time.. what's the point in playing anymore? I don't laugh anymore.. I smiled because it's required. I'm a friend because I have to be, those people need me. I can't confide in anyone, they'll view my family in a negative light... can't have that... got to keep my positive, happy image. Do I have things to be grateful for? Sure. A lot of things. However, once I'm gone, those things won't matter either. Whether I view them negatively or positively in the end, it's all the same. They'll go away when I do. It's seems to trivial.. everyone is provided a different hand, almost like a joke. How will they play out with what they were given? What choices will they make to better or worsen themselves? I'm not suicidal, I'm just existing. My bitterness is oozing into those around me and I often think to myself if I wasn't around, they'd have a better chance at making the life they have worth living. That thought stays with me often... I thought for the longest time I had overcome my darkest demons and succeeded where I never thought I'd go.. I did at one time. Demons seem to mutate over time.. you may leave some behind but new ones creep in and desecrate everything you've built for so long. I hate when I ask for advice, help, etc.. it's given to me in riddles, analogies, etc. Just tell me what to do, if I could figure it out, I would have... that tells me one thing. No one has it figured it out. What works for you, won't work for the next person. The main question I have is, why? Why am I here? What am I doing? Why did I have children? Why did I do this to them? Why did I get married when I never wanted to? Why did I do all these things that I never intended on doing and now I'm filled with why?",1

1644275714.0,The no-BS enlightenment,"Don't get caught up in the Enlightenment experience or ""awakening"" hype. There is nothing to change or attain. Meditation at its purest form teaches you that Beingness is whole and plenty, independent of the terms you grew up with. Realizing this is what I like to call Transparency and it's tidily locked with ""what has to be, has to be"".

To put it simply, Enlightenment is just acknowledging Consciousness, that is, one's true Identity. It's available to everyone and everything. Nobody, and nothing can avoid the basic, intuitive notion that one is existence itself, in particular, here and now as a human being, a subjective experience. Even if you ponder about your past or your future, and delve deeply into your thoughts, you are still present and aware of it. Enlightenment aren't experiences, and everyone has it. Although one might not recognize this, thus not having it for oneself. Here's the paradoxical experience, but ""don't look at the finger, or you'll miss all that heavenly glory"".

Sit, be calm, and let it unfold. Look how transient this calmness is, and then, you become Calm. This is Transparency to ""what has to be"". This is Wholeness. This is Enlightenment. But, I'm fooling myself. How good that this is so. Ahhh, Salvation!

""If you ever declare  
that you have attained Enlightenment,  
so it is because you found out who you are.  
But how can anyone be sure one is Enlightened?

When you don't know who you are,  
you will be in the shadow.  
When you know who you are,  
you will be in the light.

But to know the totality of what you are,  
it is necessary to know the totality of what you aren't.  
And to know the totality of what you are not,  
you have to be it.""

1701634200.0,I cannot stop being conscious and it makes me panic like nothing else,"I'm basically cursed with this absolutely fucking AGONISING overawareness that I'm ""trapped"" being conscious, like think about it, it's impossible to just simply stop thinking about anything, your mind is always going to be bombarded by thoughts wether you like it or not, and there's literally NO WAY to turn it off or make it stop, even when you sleep you'll be thinking in your dreams, there is absolutely 1000000% no escape from this ever, from my perspective I'm practically ""stuck"" being conscious, and who's to say death is even a escape? I'll more than likely just transform into another form of consciousness since the observer never dies

When I say it makes me panic, I mean panic that makes me pace around my room nonstop for 3 hours straight, or lying in bed completely stiff and too terrified to even move or open my eyes, fighting every fucking urge to guzzle my whiskey to get a moment of peace, at its worst I can't eat, I can't shower, I can hardly get up to go pee, it completely and utterly disables me, all because I fucking realized that I cant stop being conscious, I also have a constant 24/7 wince on my face because I'm so uncomfortable with my own consciousness, it's turned into this very physical sensation of being trapped inside my skull and it's absolutely beyond fucking excruciating

Every day I absolutely fucking despise myself for becoming aware of this knowledge, I've had to stop absolutely everything in life I love because of these debilitating panic attacks:

I've stopped my volunteering, because of this realisation...

I've stopped my gym attendance, because of this realisation...

I've stopped my weekly coffee morning group,  because of this realisation...

I've stopped going for walks around town, because of this realisation...

I've stopped my driving lessons and missed my chance to get my license, because of this realisation... 

I've stopped any prospect of looking for a job, because of this realisation...

It's absolutely fucking destroyed my life completely, just knowing that I'm completely trapped in existence and consciousness for all of eternity with absolutely zero way of escaping it at all",1
1684021645.0,I was nothing before I was born. I'll be nothing after I die. Doesn't that imply I could come back to life in some form after death?,"I mean, if I started out as nothing but managed to claw my way out of the eternal abyss and on into being, then shouldn't it naturally follow that it will happen again after I die? Everyone talks about how there is probably nothing after death and that it's an instant eternity of nothingness. But if nothingness is how I started, shouldn't being just kinda happen again? By my perspective, some kind of reincarnation seems almsot innevitably. What do you guys think?",1
